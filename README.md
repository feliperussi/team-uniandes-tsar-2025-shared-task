# Team Uniandes - TSAR 2025 Shared Task

This repository contains Team Uniandes' submission and materials for the TSAR 2025 Shared Task on CEFR simplification.

## Repository Structure

### `/n8n_agents`

Contains JSON files for the various agents developed in n8n for the CEFR simplification task.

### `/prompts`

Stores the prompt templates and configurations used to guide the language models in performing CEFR simplification tasks.

### `/submissions`

Contains the official submission files generated by our system for the TSAR 2025 shared task evaluation.

### `results.xlsx`

Contains the results for each run.

### `/text-api`

A REST API implementation that serves as the backend for our n8n workflow agent. This API handles text processing requests and integrates with our simplification pipeline.

### `/vocabulary.json`

A comprehensive CEFR-aligned dictionary that we compiled specifically for this task. This vocabulary resource is designed to be used by evaluators and contains word difficulty mappings according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) levels.

## Technical Implementation

The system utilizes an n8n workflow automation platform that interfaces with the text-api to process simplification requests. The modular architecture allows for flexible experimentation with different simplification strategies and prompt configurations.

## Usage

The agents can be deployed through the n8n platform, which communicates with the text-api endpoint to process text simplification requests. The vocabulary.json file serves as a reference for determining word complexity levels during the simplification process.
