I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.", "target_cefr": "B1", "simplified": "A lot of what the speaker said seemed true, and I really believe there is a danger that we feel more isolated when we are more connected. I don't think this is a big problem for my generation, because we have lived without technology for a long time and we know that it's okay to be alone. However, the situation is completely different for people under 20. They are so busy communicating that they never experience **solitude, which is the feeling of being alone**, and there is a risk they won't learn how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they are learning conversation through messages that can be edited, which means they are not learning the skill of having a real conversation with the person in front of them."}

When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored.

Don't always give good feedback and then bad feedback. If you do this, the good words are not special anymore. They lose their power. So, sometimes you should only give good feedback. Do not give any bad feedback after it."}

If you always give positive and negative comments together, the positive feedback can become less important and people may start to ignore it. For this reason, you should make sure there are times when you only give positive feedback, and you should avoid offering criticism at the same time."}
