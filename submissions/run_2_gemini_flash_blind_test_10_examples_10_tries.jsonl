This is the number of employees who leave the company. Although this might not seem high when you first look, the normal level for this industry is 7%. The main aim of this report is to look into the reasons for `employee engagement` in the company. `Employee engagement` means how interested and involved employees are in their work. We will use what we find. From this, we will suggest ways to make employees feel better about their place of work and to keep more employees."}
