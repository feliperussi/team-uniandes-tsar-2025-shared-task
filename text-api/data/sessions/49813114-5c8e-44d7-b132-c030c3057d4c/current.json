However, this is far from the truth. In reality, a great transformation is happening. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have earned more money and have left poverty. In addition, six million fewer children die every year from disease, millions more girls are now in school, and millions of people can get clean water.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors, and both MeaningBERT (0.8749) and BERTScore (0.9515) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer effectively simplified the original text to a B1 level. The definition of 'poverty' was well-integrated and helpful for a B1 reader. Vocabulary candidates were handled skillfully, with phrases like 'increased their income' simplified to 'earned more money' and 'have access to' to 'can get'. The flow and structure are clear, using appropriate B1 connectors such as 'However' and 'In addition'. This is a strong simplification that meets all requirements.",
