They also think these countries are ruled by dictators and have little hope for any real change. However, this is not true. The real situation is that a big change is happening. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have earned more money and have left poverty. In addition, six million fewer children die every year from disease, and millions more girls are now in school. Also, millions of people can get clean water.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. While the text successfully defines 'poverty' and uses some B1 connectors like 'However' and 'In addition', the overall sentence structure and grammatical complexity are too simple for B1. For example, the original text's complex sentence 'The majority of people believe that developing countries are in a terrible situation: suffering from incredible poverty, governed by dictators and with little hope for any meaningful change' was simplified into two shorter, more direct sentences. Similarly, the original's final sentence listing three positive changes was split into two simpler sentences. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to incorporate more varied and slightly more complex sentence structures, such as more subordinate clauses (e.g., using 'although', 'while', 'unless') or more complex relative clauses, without oversimplifying the core message. The factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.8581), and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.9427) were all excellent, indicating a strong understanding of the source material, but the target CEFR level was missed.",

There are no factual errors, and both MeaningBERT (0.8749) and BERTScore (0.9515) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer effectively simplified the original text to a B1 level. The definition of 'poverty' was well-integrated and helpful for a B1 reader. Vocabulary candidates were handled skillfully, with phrases like 'increased their income' simplified to 'earned more money' and 'have access to' to 'can get'. The flow and structure are clear, using appropriate B1 connectors such as 'However' and 'In addition'. This is a strong simplification that meets all requirements.",
