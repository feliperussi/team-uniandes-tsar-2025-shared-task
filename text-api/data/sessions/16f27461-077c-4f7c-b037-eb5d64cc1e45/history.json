For example, the sentence 'NASA is now working to find some asteroids, which are large rocks in space that are 140 metres wide or more' uses multiple relative clauses and embedded information that push it towards B2. Similarly, 'People believe there are 25,000 asteroids of this size, but until now, only about 8,000 have been found, so 17,000 are still not known about' is a long sentence with three coordinated clauses, which can be challenging for B1 learners. To achieve B1, sentences should generally be shorter and contain fewer clauses. Suggestion: Break down complex sentences into two or more simpler sentences. For instance, the first sentence could be split into: 'NASA is now working to find some asteroids. These are large rocks in space. They are 140 metres wide or more.' This reduces the cognitive load and aligns better with B1 sentence structure expectations.",

The primary reason for this classification is the oversimplification of sentence structures and vocabulary, leading to a choppy and overly basic style. For example, the original sentence 'Now NASA is working towards logging some of the smaller asteroids, those measuring 140 metres wide or more' was split into three very short, simple sentences: 'NASA is now working to find some asteroids. These are large rocks in space. They are 140 metres wide or more.' While 'These are large rocks in space' provides a good definition for 'asteroids', breaking the information into such short, declarative sentences reduces the overall CEFR level. Similarly, the phrase 'unaccounted for' was simplified to 'still not known about', and 'estimated' to 'People believe', which are appropriate for A2 but too basic for B1. The use of simple connectors like 'However' and 'Because of this' also contributes to an A2 feel. To achieve a B1 level, the writer should aim for more complex sentence structures, including the use of relative clauses (e.g., 'asteroids, which are large rocks...'), a wider range of B1-level conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'while', 'therefore', 'consequently'), and slightly more sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate, without sacrificing clarity. Combining some of the very short sentences would also improve flow and raise the CEFR level.",

While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9236, BERTScore: 0.9691), the overall linguistic complexity was reduced too much for a B1 classification. This is likely due to several factors: 1. The original text was already quite straightforward, making further simplification challenging without dropping below B1. 2. The simplification of 'logging' to 'identify' (an A2 verb) in the first sentence contributed to lowering the lexical complexity. 3. The explicit definition of 'asteroids' as 'large rocks in space' uses very basic, A1/A2 vocabulary, which, while clear, reduces the B1 lexical challenge. 4. The sentence structures, while containing some B1 elements (e.g., the relative clause 'which are' and the connector 'however'), are predominantly direct and common in A2/B1. To achieve a B1 classification, consider retaining slightly more complex but still accessible vocabulary where appropriate, or introducing slightly more varied sentence structures. For example, 'working towards logging' could have been simplified to 'working to track' or 'working to record' which are still B1-appropriate. The explicit definition of 'asteroids' could be integrated more subtly or assumed if the target audience has some prior knowledge, allowing for a slightly higher lexical demand.",

Additionally, while grammatically correct for B1, the sentence 'Asteroids are space rocks that measure 140 metres wide or more' could be simplified further by splitting it or rephrasing the measurement. The final sentence, 'Because of this, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit,' while using a B1 connector and conditional, is quite long and information-dense for a B1 target. To achieve a B1 classification, consider replacing 'means' with a simpler phrase like 'This shows that' or 'So,'. Also, break down longer sentences, for example, 'Asteroids are space rocks. They are 140 metres wide or more.' or 'These middle-sized asteroids are a serious danger. This is because they could enter Earth's orbit.'",

The primary reason for this classification is likely the use of the verb 'log' in the sentence 'NASA is now working to log some of these smaller asteroids, which are 140 metres wide or more.' According to the provided vocabulary candidates, 'log' is a C1 level word. While the writer did simplify 'logged' to 'recorded' later in the text, the initial use of 'log' introduces a higher-level vocabulary item and creates an inconsistency. Additionally, the sentence 'Of the 25,000 asteroids of this size, only about 8,000 have been recorded so far, so 17,000 are still not yet recorded' is quite long and uses a slightly complex 'so...so' structure for B1. Suggestion: Replace 'to log' with 'to record' or 'to find and list' to maintain consistency and lower the vocabulary level. Consider splitting the long sentence about the 25,000 asteroids into two shorter sentences to improve readability and reduce complexity for a B1 audience. For example: 'Only about 8,000 of these 25,000 asteroids have been recorded so far. This means 17,000 are still not yet recorded.'

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. The most likely reason for this classification is the use of the word 'means' in the sentence 'This means that 17,000 are still not yet recorded.' While 'This means that...' is a common phrase, the word 'means' itself is often classified at a B2 level in isolation. To achieve a B1 classification, consider replacing 'means' with a simpler alternative. For example, you could rephrase it as 'This shows that 17,000 are still not yet recorded' or simply 'So, 17,000 are still not yet recorded.'",
