There are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but only about 8,000 of them have been recorded so far. This means that 17,000 are still not yet recorded. A 19-metre asteroid exploded above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013, and it injured 1,200 people. Because of this, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they come to Earth.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. The most likely reason for this classification is the use of the word 'means' in the sentence 'This means that 17,000 are still not yet recorded.' While 'This means that...' is a common phrase, the word 'means' itself is often classified at a B2 level in isolation. To achieve a B1 classification, consider replacing 'means' with a simpler alternative. For example, you could rephrase it as 'This shows that 17,000 are still not yet recorded' or simply 'So, 17,000 are still not yet recorded.'",
