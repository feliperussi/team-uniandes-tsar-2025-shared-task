This extensive splitting significantly reduces the grammatical complexity below the B1 threshold.

Consider maintaining slightly more complex sentence structures, perhaps by using B1-level connectors or subordinate clauses, rather than splitting every complex idea into multiple simple sentences.

For example, the sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation which happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and which seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces' is too long and contains multiple clauses, making it challenging for a B1 reader. To achieve a B1 level, this sentence should be broken down into two or more shorter sentences. For instance, 'Researchers have found a gene mutation. It happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces.' Additionally, while 'gene' and 'mutation' were identified as keywords, they were not defined in the text. For a B1 audience, it would be beneficial to provide a simple definition for these core scientific terms, especially 'mutation', to ensure full comprehension.",

The primary reason for this classification is the oversimplification of sentence structure and the addition of explicit definitions for keywords. For example, the original complex sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' was broken into three very simple sentences: 'Researchers have found a gene mutation. This mutation happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. It seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces.' While definitions for 'gene' and 'mutation' are helpful, integrating them more subtly or using slightly more complex sentence structures (e.g., using relative clauses or B1 connectors) would help maintain the B1 target level.
