    "text_translated": "Scientists are asking more questions about how genes, which are parts of our bodies that carry information about us, influence the brain and language development. For example, did a gene mutation, which is a change in a gene, give us the ability to speak? Researchers have found a gene mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not have this mutation. It is still too early to say how much genes influence language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. The primary reason for this is the extensive use of explicit, simple definitions for key terms, such as 'genes, which are parts of our bodies that carry information about us' and 'gene mutation, which is a change in a gene'. While these definitions are clear and accurate, they simplify the text to an A2 level. Additionally, the sentence structures are predominantly simple or simple compound sentences, lacking the variety and slightly more complex structures expected at B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating definitions more subtly or assuming a slightly higher baseline understanding for some terms. For example, 'genes, which carry information about us' might be sufficient. Also, explore using a wider range of B1-level sentence structures, such as more varied subordinate clauses or relative clauses without explicit 'which is a...' explanations.",
