I talked with my boss, and we agreed to reduce my work to a three-day week. Of course, this meant a big cut in my pay because I am paid for the days I work. However, I have noticed that the amount of work I have has not changed at all. I am now doing five days of work in only three days, but I'm getting paid much less for it.",

The sentence 'After my time off for having a baby, I decided I wanted to spend more time with my children before they go to school' is 25 words long. Sentences must be shorter and more direct. The text also uses the B2 word 'reduce' without explanation or replacement. This is a clear violation of the vocabulary rules."
