    "text_translated": "I used to work a normal five-day week. I had some time off after having a baby. Then, I decided I wanted more time with my children before they go to school. I talked with my boss, and we agreed to make my work week shorter. Now I only work three days a week. Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay. I am only paid for the days I work. However, I have noticed that my amount of work has not changed at all. I am now doing five days of work in only three days. But I'm getting paid much less for it.",
