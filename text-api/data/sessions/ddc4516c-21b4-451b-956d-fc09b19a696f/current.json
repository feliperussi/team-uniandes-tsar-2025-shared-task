    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8852 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved. The simplification was too aggressive, sacrificing lexical precision. Specific deviations include: The term 'disposable clothing problem' was replaced with 'problem of throwing away clothes'. This simplification loses lexical precision. The phrase 'Huge quantities' was simplified to 'So many clothes', which is less precise and lowers the fidelity score. The original text's causal link '...problem because they donate...' was broken into separate sentences, weakening the direct logical connection. Suggestion: Revise the text to increase lexical fidelity while maintaining A2 simplicity. Restore the direct causal link using 'because'. Re-evaluate simplifications of key terms like 'disposable' and 'huge quantities' to find closer A2-level equivalents.",
