But most countries live together more peacefully now. This is better than in the past.\nBut bad people hurt others to make a country afraid. This is called terrorism. This problem went up a lot in the last few years.\nFrom World War II until now, fights killed many more normal people than soldiers.\nBut even for normal people, the news is not all bad.\nPeople are nine times more often killed by very bad crime, but this is more than by a fight about how a country is run.\nBut the number of murders for every 100,000 people around the world fell a little. This is good.\nIn 2000, 8 people died for every 100,000 people. In 2015, this number was about 5.3.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6825 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message's core meaning. While the text attempts to simplify, it distorts a crucial comparison.\n\nSpecific Deviation:\n- Meaning Distortion: The sentence 'People are nine times more often killed by very bad crime, but this is more than by a fight about how a country is run' fails to accurately convey the original meaning. The original text states that 'deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict'. Your phrasing 'this is more than' is ambiguous and incorrectly compares 'very bad crime' itself to 'a fight about how a country is run', rather than comparing the likelihood of deaths from these two causes. This fundamentally misrepresents the statistical comparison.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the problematic sentence to clearly state that deaths from very bad crime happen nine times more often than deaths from fights about how a country is run. Ensure the comparison is between the frequency of deaths, not the nature of the events themselves.",
