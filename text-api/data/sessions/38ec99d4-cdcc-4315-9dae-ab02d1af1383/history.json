The sentence structures, while clear, also lean towards simpler A2 constructions.

While the factual integrity and meaning preservation are excellent (MeaningBERT 0.9104, BERTScore 0.9773), the simplification strategy has reduced the linguistic complexity below the target. For example, the original phrase 'fuelling rapid population growth' was simplified to 'This caused the population to grow quickly', which uses simpler vocabulary and a more basic sentence structure. Similarly, 'with the wider availability of contraception' was simplified to 'when more people could get contraception', and the sentence was split, further reducing its grammatical complexity. To achieve a B1 level, consider reintroducing some B1-level vocabulary (e.g., 'rapid population growth' instead of 'grow quickly') and using more complex sentence structures or B1 connectors (e.g., 'resulting in', 'consequently') to combine ideas rather than splitting them into very short, simple sentences. For instance, the last two sentences could be combined: 'But with more contraception available in the 1960s, the average number of babies per woman around the world has declined from six to as low as two.'",

This is because the output is identical to the original text, meaning no simplification was performed to meet the B1 target. The MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics are high (1.0 for both) because the text is an exact copy, indicating perfect fidelity but a complete lack of simplification. Specific examples of B2 complexity in the text include: The use of the participle clause 'fuelling rapid population growth' which could be simplified to 'and this caused rapid population growth'. Vocabulary such as 'adulthood' and 'contraception' are typically B2. These could be simplified to 'when they became adults' or 'birth control'. The phrase 'wider availability' could be simplified to 'when it was easier to get'. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to be actively simplified, breaking down complex sentences, replacing higher-level vocabulary, and rephrasing more abstract concepts into concrete terms. For instance, 'global average number of babies per woman has declined' could be 'women around the world are having fewer babies'.",

The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is effective. The phrase 'fuelling rapid population growth' was appropriately simplified to 'and this caused rapid population growth'. 'Into adulthood' was rephrased as 'until they became adults', which is clearer for a B1 audience. Most notably, 'with the wider availability of contraception' was skillfully simplified to 'when it was easier to get birth control', making the concept much more accessible. The decision to split the final complex sentence of the original into two simpler sentences in the output ('women around the world started having fewer babies. The number went down...') significantly improves readability and flow for the B1 level. The vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate replacements or retention where suitable for B1. This is a very strong simplification.",
