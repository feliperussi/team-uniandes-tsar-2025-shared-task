    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8355) and BERTScore (0.969) are well above their respective thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is effective. The phrase 'fuelling rapid population growth' was appropriately simplified to 'and this caused rapid population growth'. 'Into adulthood' was rephrased as 'until they became adults', which is clearer for a B1 audience. Most notably, 'with the wider availability of contraception' was skillfully simplified to 'when it was easier to get birth control', making the concept much more accessible. The decision to split the final complex sentence of the original into two simpler sentences in the output ('women around the world started having fewer babies. The number went down...') significantly improves readability and flow for the B1 level. The vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate replacements or retention where suitable for B1. This is a very strong simplification.",
