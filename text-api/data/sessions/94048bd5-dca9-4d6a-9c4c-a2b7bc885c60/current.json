    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.894 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the meaning is largely preserved, the lexical fidelity is not sufficient for a pass. Specific examples of lost or significantly altered phrasing include: 'proponent' was removed. 'plasticity of the brain' was simplified to 'brain can change and grow', losing the specific scientific term. 'tend to focus our praise' was simplified to 'praise'. 'research suggests' was simplified to 'studies show a different way'. 'encourage the development' was simplified to 'helps people learn'. 'continued honing of talents' was simplified to 'make their talents better and better'. These cumulative changes, while aiming for simplicity, resulted in a BERTScore below the required threshold. Suggestion: Retain more of the original's specific vocabulary where possible, even if it requires a brief A2-level explanation, to improve lexical overlap without increasing complexity. For example, 'plasticity' could be explained as 'the brain's ability to change easily'.",
