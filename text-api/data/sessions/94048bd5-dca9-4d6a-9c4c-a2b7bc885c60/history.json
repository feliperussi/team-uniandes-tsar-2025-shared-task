The original text emphasizes the research-backed ability to 'encourage the development' and 'continued honing' of skills through process-focused praise. Your version weakens this core message by stating 'It is better to praise' and 'This helps people learn', which loses the direct causal strength and the specific concept of 'encouragement' and 'honing' as a result of the strategy. The specific role of Carol Dweck as a 'proponent' is also lost. \n\nFAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.89 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key lexical information. Specific terms like 'Psychologist', 'proponent', 'plasticity', 'seemingly innate talents', 'experimentation', 'problem-solving strategies', and 'honing' were replaced with overly simplified or less precise phrases, losing important detail and nuance from the original text. \n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is due to vocabulary choices that exceed the A2 level. \n\nSpecific Deviations: \n- Vocabulary: The word 'planning' in 'planning parties' is classified as B1. The word 'means' in 'A growth mindset means you believe...' is classified as B2. These words are above the A2 standard and contribute to the B1 classification. \n- Meaning Loss: The concept of 'proponent' for Carol Dweck is lost. The original's emphasis on 'encouraging the development' and 'continued honing' is diluted to 'helps people learn new skills' and 'helps them get better'. \n- Lexical Precision: Terms like 'plasticity of the brain' were simplified to 'brain can change' and 'brain can grow', losing the specific scientific term. 'Experimentation' was simplified to 'try new things', and 'problem-solving strategies' to 'fix problems', losing the more formal and precise A2-appropriate terms. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore the strength of the causal link between praise and skill development.

The text also failed the Fidelity Check with a BERTScore of 0.8729, which is below the required 0.90. Additionally, the text failed CEFR compliance, as the classifier rated it B1, not A2. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's emphasis on 'encourage the development' and 'continued honing' through specific types of praise (effort, experimentation, problem-solving strategies) is diluted. The simplified version 'helps our brain to change. It helps new skills grow. It makes talents better and better' is too direct and loses the nuance of active encouragement and ongoing refinement. The concept of a 'proponent' is also simplified to 'supports the idea,' which is less precise.\n*   Fidelity Failure: The extensive rephrasing of key terms, while aiming for A2, significantly reduced lexical overlap with the original. For example, 'Psychologist' was replaced with 'person who studies the mind,' 'proponent' with 'supports the idea,' 'tend to focus our praise on' with 'often say good things about,' 'seemingly innate talents' with 'talents. People think these talents are there from birth,' and 'encourage the development' with 'helps new skills grow.' These changes, while simplifying, deviate too much from the original's specific phrasing, leading to the low BERTScore.\n*   CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 rating): Despite simplification efforts, the text still contains structures that push it beyond A2.\n    *   The use of 'when' clauses for definition, such as 'A 'growth mindset' is when you believe you can learn and get better,' is typically a B1 structure.\n    *   The use of 'how' clauses, such as 'Say good things about how people do things' and 'Say good things about how they find ways to fix problems,' is a B1 structure.\n    *   The phrase 'People think these talents are there from birth' is slightly more complex than typical A2 phrasing.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Suggestion: Rephrase the section on praise to more clearly convey the active 'encouragement' and 'continued honing' of skills and talents, perhaps using simpler verbs that still carry this meaning. For example, instead of 'helps new skills grow', consider 'helps new skills get stronger'.\n*   Suggestion: Review all instances where original vocabulary was replaced. While simplification is necessary, ensure the core lexical meaning is retained as much as possible to improve BERTScore. For example, 'Psychologist' could be 'a doctor for the mind'.\n*   Suggestion: Simplify sentence structures further. Avoid 'when' and 'how' clauses for definitions or explanations. Break down complex ideas into even shorter, more direct sentences. For example, instead of 'A 'growth mindset' is when you believe you can learn and get better,' try 'A 'growth mindset' means you believe you can learn. You believe you can get better.' Instead of 'Say good things about how people do things,' try 'Say good things about the way people do things.' or 'Say good things about the steps people take.'",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even if the meaning was preserved. Additionally, the text failed CEFR Compliance, as the classifier rated it B1, not the required A2. This means the text is too complex for the A2 standard. Deviations are detailed below. Deviation 1: BERTScore Failure. The text replaced too many specific terms and phrases from the original, leading to a low BERTScore. For example, 'Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent' was replaced with 'Carol Dweck is a doctor for the mind. She believes in a 'growth mindset'.' While semantically similar, the lexical overlap is insufficient. Similarly, 'seemingly innate talents' was replaced with 'talents are from birth', and 'problem-solving strategies' was broken down into 'finding ways to fix problems. These are 'strategies'.' These replacements, while simplifying, do not maintain the lexical fidelity required. Deviation 2: CEFR Compliance Failure. The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is due to the continued presence of higher-level vocabulary, even when defined. Words like 'plasticity', 'experimentation', 'strategies', and 'honing' are B2/C1 level. While defining them is an A2 strategy, their mere presence, combined with the overall conceptual density, pushed the text into B1. Deviation 3: Vocabulary Audit. The provided 'Vocabulary Candidates for Replacement' list flags 'means' and 'finding' as B2 words. The text uses 'A 'growth mindset' means you believe you can learn' and 'Praise them for finding ways to fix problems'. These usages contribute to the B1 classification. Suggestion: To improve BERTScore, attempt to retain more original keywords where possible, or use very close A2 synonyms rather than breaking down phrases extensively. To achieve A2 CEFR compliance, rigorously replace all B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A1/A2 equivalents, even if it means rephrasing concepts entirely. Avoid relying on defining higher-level words; instead, replace them. Rephrase sentences to avoid words like 'means' and 'finding' if they are flagged as above A2.",

While simplification is necessary for A2, the lexical choices made resulted in insufficient overlap with the source material. For example, 'psychologist' was replaced with 'person who studies the mind', 'plasticity' with 'can change a lot', 'proponent' was omitted, 'innate talents' was rephrased as 'talents. People think these talents are natural', 'experimentation' became 'trying new things', and 'honing' was simplified to 'make better'. These lexical deviations collectively caused the BERTScore to fall below the required threshold. \n\nAdditionally, the CEFR classifier rated the output as B1, not A2. This is a further deviation from the A2 standard. Specific B1 structures include the use of a relative clause in 'Carol Dweck is a person who studies the mind' and 'We should praise the way people do things'. A2 texts typically rely on simpler, more direct sentence structures without such embedded clauses. \n\nSuggestion: To improve the BERTScore, you must retain more of the original's specific vocabulary where possible, even if defined simply. For example, 'psychologist' could be retained and defined in simple terms. To achieve A2 classification, simplify sentences further. Avoid relative clauses like 'who studies the mind' or 'the way people do things'. Break these into two simpler, independent sentences.",

This indicates a significant loss of specific lexical detail from the original text, even if the general meaning is preserved. Your output deviates from the A2 standard in several critical areas: Deviations: 1. BERTScore Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8862 is too low. For example, the original text's specific term 'proponent' was omitted, and the idiomatic expression 'have an eye for details' was simplified to 'good at seeing small things'. While the meaning is conveyed, the lexical precision and fidelity to the original phrasing are lost. 2. Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses multiple words that are above the A2 CEFR standard. 'Psychologist' (B2), 'means' (B2), 'making' (B2), and 'growth' (B1, in 'growth mindset') are all present. A2 texts must strictly adhere to A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to incorporate more of the original's specific vocabulary where appropriate, ensuring the BERTScore meets the 0.90 threshold. Replace all B1 and B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 equivalents. For instance, instead of 'psychologist', describe the role in A2 terms. Avoid using 'means' repeatedly for definitions; use simpler sentence structures or rephrase.",

The classifier rated the text as B2, not A2. This is due to the presence of several words above the A2 level, even though definitions were provided. The word 'growth' in 'growth mindset' is B1. The word 'plasticity' is B2/C1. The word 'innate' in 'innate talents' is B2/C1. The word 'experimentation' is B1. The word 'hone' in 'hone talents' is B2/C1. While defining these terms is a good strategy for B1, for a strict A2 text, these words should ideally be replaced with simpler A2 synonyms or rephrased entirely to avoid their use. The presence of these higher-level words elevates the text beyond the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: To improve the BERTScore, retain more of the original's specific terminology where possible, or find A2 synonyms that are lexically closer. For CEFR compliance, replace all B1/B2/C1 vocabulary with strictly A2 words. For example, instead of 'plasticity', use only 'Our brain can change'. Instead of 'innate talents', use 'talents you are born with' without using the word 'innate'. Replace 'experimentation' with 'trying new things' and 'hone' with 'make better' consistently.",
