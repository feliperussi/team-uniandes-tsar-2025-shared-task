    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: The output is a perfect factual representation of the original text. All key information is retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2. The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels, with words like 'boss', 'less', and 'amount' being appropriate for the standard.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences. The use of basic connectors like 'So' and 'But' is executed correctly for A2-level readability.\n- Meaning Preservation: The metrics confirm that the core meaning is preserved (MeaningBERT: 0.7985) and lexical fidelity is high (BERTScore: 0.9134). Complex concepts like 'pro-rata basis' were effectively simplified to 'much less money' without loss of meaning.",
