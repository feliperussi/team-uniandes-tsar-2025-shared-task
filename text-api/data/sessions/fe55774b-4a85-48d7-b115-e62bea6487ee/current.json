    "text_translated": "Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we see signs of early human civilisation. Civilisation is when people live together in groups and have art and rules. For example, we see paintings on walls inside big holes in the rock. Nobody knows the link between this and language. People's brains did not get bigger quickly. But people became smarter and their lives were not simple. Did using language make their brains get better? Or did their better brains start to make language?",
