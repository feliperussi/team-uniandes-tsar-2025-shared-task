    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 CEFR readability standards and accurately conveys the original meaning. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7893 and BERTScore of 0.9072 confirm excellent meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The writer effectively simplified complex concepts such as 'parental leave' into 'I had a baby. I took time off work.' and 'pro-rata basis' into 'I get money for the hours I work.' Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using appropriate A2 connectors like 'Then', 'So', and 'But'. All vocabulary is within the A2 range, demonstrating a clear understanding of the target level.",
