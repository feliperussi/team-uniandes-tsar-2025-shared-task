The original text specifies the decision to reduce working days was made 'after I came out of my parental leave', which provides a specific context of returning to work after a period off. Your version states 'Then I had a baby', which is a past event but does not fully capture the nuance of the decision being made in the context of ending parental leave and returning to work. This subtle shift in the precise trigger for the change in work schedule results in a slight loss of the original's intended meaning and context.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7893 and BERTScore of 0.9072 confirm excellent meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The writer effectively simplified complex concepts such as 'parental leave' into 'I had a baby. I took time off work.' and 'pro-rata basis' into 'I get money for the hours I work.' Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using appropriate A2 connectors like 'Then', 'So', and 'But'. All vocabulary is within the A2 range, demonstrating a clear understanding of the target level.",
