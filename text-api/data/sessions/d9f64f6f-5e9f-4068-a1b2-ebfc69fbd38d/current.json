    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks in space. Some asteroids are dangerous. They are dangerous because they can come very close to Earth. This is less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids. But NASA thinks none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to watch these objects.
