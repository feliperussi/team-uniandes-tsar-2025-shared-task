        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates core rules. 1. Vocabulary: The word 'protect' is B1 level, which is unacceptable for an A2 text. The goal is to use vocabulary the learner already possesses, not introduce new B1 terms. 2. Factual Inaccuracy: The text omits critical information from the original source. The specific distance '7.5 million kilometres', which defines why these asteroids are dangerous, has been removed. This is a major factual omission."

The simplification of complex concepts like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and 'defence solutions' into understandable A2 terms is exemplary. No violations of the rules were found."
