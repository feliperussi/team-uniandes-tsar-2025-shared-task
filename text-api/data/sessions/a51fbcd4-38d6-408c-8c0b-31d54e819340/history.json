While the text successfully preserved factual integrity (Priority 1) and meaning/fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.8521, BERTScore 0.965 - Priority 2), it oversimplified the language, resulting in an A2 classification. For example, the original word 'identical' (B2) was rephrased to 'who look exactly alike', and 'huge' (B2) was simplified to 'very big' (A1/A2). Additionally, 'cranes' (B1) was explicitly defined as 'special machines called cranes', which further reduces the lexical complexity. To achieve a B1 level, the text should incorporate more B1 vocabulary and sentence structures. Consider using words like 'identical' or 'enormous' directly, and avoid over-explaining terms that are generally understood at a B1 level. The current simplification strategy has pushed the text below the target CEFR band.",

        "feedback_text": "The writer's output is an exact copy of the original text. This means that no simplification was performed. However, the original text itself is already well-suited for a B1 CEFR level, which is why it passed all the required checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT score of 1.0), and fidelity (BERTScore of 1.0). The CEFR classifier also correctly identified the text as B1. While this submission technically meets all the minimum requirements, future submissions should demonstrate an active effort to simplify the text, even if the original is already relatively simple. For example, the word 'identical' (B2 candidate) could have been considered for a simpler alternative, although in context with 'twin brothers' it is understandable for B1. The current output is accurate and appropriate for the target audience, but it does not showcase simplification skills.",
