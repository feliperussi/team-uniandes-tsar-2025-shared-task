        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8994 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even if the general meaning is preserved. Specific examples of lexical loss include: The term 'clich\u00e9' was replaced with 'idea', losing the nuance of a common, overused plot device. 'Especially popular' was simplified to 'Many people liked it', losing the intensity of 'especially'. 'Group of teenagers' was simplified to 'young people', losing the specific noun 'teenagers' and the quantifier 'group'. 'Except one girl' was rephrased as 'But one girl does not die', losing the precise connector 'except'. 'Innocent, shy' was simplified to 'good. She is quiet.', losing the specific adjectives 'innocent' and 'shy'. 'Toughest and most resourceful person in the world' was significantly rephrased to 'strongest person. She is very smart. She finds ways to win.', losing the specific adjectives 'toughest' and 'resourceful' and the superlative 'in the world'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the BERTScore metric demands a higher degree of lexical preservation. Suggestion: Review the original text for key nouns and adjectives that can be simplified to A2 equivalents without completely losing their lexical presence or being replaced by overly generic terms. For example, 'clich\u00e9' could be explained as 'a common story idea that many films use' rather than just 'idea'.",
