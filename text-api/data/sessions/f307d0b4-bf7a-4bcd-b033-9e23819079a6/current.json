    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The text successfully maintains factual integrity and preserves the core meaning, as confirmed by the strong MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The key strength of this submission is its excellent handling of the keyword 'Buy Nothing Day'. Instead of just using the term, the writer skillfully integrated a clear, simple definition directly into the text: 'Buy Nothing Day is a day when people try not to buy anything.' This is a model strategy for B1 simplification. Furthermore, complex concepts like 'a rejection of the overspending' were expertly rephrased into the more accessible 'a way for people to say no to spending too much', making the text clear and easy to understand without losing critical information.",
