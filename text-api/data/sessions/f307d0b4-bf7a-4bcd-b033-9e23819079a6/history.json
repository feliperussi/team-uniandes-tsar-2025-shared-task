        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is due to two main issues. First, the C1-level word 'refusal' was used, which is too advanced for the target audience. A simpler B1 alternative would be to rephrase the idea, for example: 'There, it became a way for people to say no to overspending...'. Second, the sentence 'Buy Nothing Day, which is a day when people try not to buy anything, sees people organise various protests...' is structurally too complex for B1. The non-defining relative clause and the figurative use of the verb 'sees' are B2-level features. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences, such as: 'On Buy Nothing Day, people try not to buy anything. They organise various protests and even cut up their credit cards.' The text successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, but failed to meet the required simplicity level.",

The text successfully maintains factual integrity and preserves the core meaning, as confirmed by the strong MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The key strength of this submission is its excellent handling of the keyword 'Buy Nothing Day'. Instead of just using the term, the writer skillfully integrated a clear, simple definition directly into the text: 'Buy Nothing Day is a day when people try not to buy anything.' This is a model strategy for B1 simplification. Furthermore, complex concepts like 'a rejection of the overspending' were expertly rephrased into the more accessible 'a way for people to say no to spending too much', making the text clear and easy to understand without losing critical information.",
