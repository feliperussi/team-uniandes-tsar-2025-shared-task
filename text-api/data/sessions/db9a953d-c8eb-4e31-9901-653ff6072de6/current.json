It meets all diagnostic criteria without deviation.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: All facts, including the numbers 140, 25000, 8000, 17000, 19, 2013, and 1200, are correctly preserved.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.79 and BERTScore of 0.91 are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, demonstrating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. There are no instances of B1 or higher vocabulary, which is a critical success factor.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text exclusively uses short, simple sentences and basic A2 connectors like 'so', 'but', and 'if'. This structure is ideal for A2 readability.",
