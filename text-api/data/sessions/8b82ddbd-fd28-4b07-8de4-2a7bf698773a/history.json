The text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning, but its grammatical structure is too complex for the A2 standard.\n\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'It also connects to how our brains control our mouths and face' uses a subordinate noun clause starting with 'how'. This is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'It is too early to know how much genes affect language' also uses a subordinate noun clause ('how much genes affect...'). This is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'Scientists found a gene that changed a long time ago' uses a relative clause ('that changed...'). While simple versions can appear at A2, its use here contributes to the overall B1 complexity.\n\nSuggestion: Eliminate all subordinate clauses. Rephrase complex sentences by breaking them into multiple, simple A2 sentences. For example, rewrite 'It also connects to how our brains control our mouths and face' as 'It also connects to our brains. Our brains use it to control our mouths and face.' Adhere strictly to simple sentence structures (Subject-Verb-Object)."

All key information, including the timeframe for the gene mutation, is preserved without error.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text exclusively uses A1 and A2 vocabulary, with the exception of the single required keyword.\n- Keyword Definition: The B2 keyword 'gene' was correctly identified and defined at the start using simple A2 terms ('A gene is a part of your body from your parents.'). This is the correct procedure for introducing necessary higher-level vocabulary.\n- Structural Simplicity: Sentence structure is consistently simple and short. Connectors are limited to basic forms like 'but'. There are no complex clauses.\n- Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.92 are well above the minimum thresholds, confirming that the core meaning and key terms were successfully retained during simplification."

All key information, including the timeframe of the gene mutation, has been preserved without error.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required ranges. MeaningBERT at 0.81 and BERTScore at 0.92 confirm high fidelity to the source text. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The text demonstrates excellent vocabulary management. The B2 keyword 'gene' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms at the beginning of the text, making the concept accessible. All other vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range.\n- Structural Simplicity: The use of short, simple sentences is consistent and effective for A2 readability. The single use of the connector 'but' is appropriate for this level. The text is a model of A2 simplification."
