    "text_translated": "A gene is a part of your body from your parents. It decides things like your hair color. We have more questions about genes and language. Did a change in a gene help us to speak? Scientists found a special gene. It changed a long time ago. This happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This change seems important for speaking. It also helps our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but their gene did not change. It is too early to know for sure how much genes affect language. One day, maybe we will find the answers in our DNA.",
