This indicates a severe failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The simplification is so extreme that it has destroyed the original meaning.\n\n- Primary Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.603 demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding or oversimplification of the source text. The original's formal recommendation for a strategic shift in management style has been reduced to a vague suggestion.\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8872 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of eliminating crucial vocabulary such as 'recommend', 'investment', 'professional development', and 'recognition'.\n- Qualitative Analysis: The phrase 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is not equivalent to 'think more about their workers'. The former is a specific business action; the latter is a vague sentiment. Similarly, reducing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' to 'say \"good job\" more often' loses the entire concept of formal recognition and reward systems.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to more accurately reflect the original concepts.

This indicates a severe failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of critical concepts.\n\n- Primary Failure: The MeaningBERT score demonstrates that the nuance and strategic intent of the original text were lost. The concept of adopting a 'people-oriented management style' was reduced to 'think more about what their workers need,' which is not an equivalent meaning.\n\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8947 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of removing key professional terms like 'positive reinforcement and recognition' and replacing them with an overly simplistic phrase like 'tell workers when their work is good.' This damages lexical fidelity.\n\n- Analysis: While the sentence structure and vocabulary are compliant with the A2 level, the core task of preserving the original message has failed. The output reads as a list of simple suggestions, losing the original's tone of a formal recommendation based on findings.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the lost concepts using simple A2 language. For example, 'positive reinforcement' can be rephrased as 'Managers should support workers and tell them they are doing a good job.' The concept of a 'management style' must be reintroduced in a simple way, such as 'Managers need a new style that focuses on people.'",

The company should let employees choose when they start and finish work. They should also be able to work from any place. Managers need to give staff new and difficult tasks. This helps them to learn and grow. Managers should also often tell employees they are doing good work. The company should invest more money to help employees improve their skills. This can help employees to communicate better. It can also help them understand other cultures. These changes will create a good work environment. Then, employees can do their best work.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and intent of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text is a formal recommendation ('we recommend that...'). Your output changes this into a simple report of findings ('The study found...'). This alters the fundamental purpose of the text, causing the low meaning score.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'invest' was used. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. A2 vocabulary must be strictly enforced.\n- Nuance Loss: The original's 'positive reinforcement and recognition' is a specific management concept. Your simplification to 'tell employees they are doing good work' loses this specific meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to begin with a clear recommendation, such as 'We recommend that Girox Foods should...'. Replace the word 'invest' with an A2-compliant phrase like 'spend more money to' or 'put more money into'. Restore the specific meaning of management actions.",
