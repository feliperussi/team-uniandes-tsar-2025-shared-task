The original text asks if animals are considered a 'danger or a pest'. Your version asks if they are a 'danger or a problem'.\n- The word 'pest' refers to a specific type of annoying animal that causes damage. The word 'problem' is too general and loses this critical meaning, causing the metric failure.\n- While the text demonstrates excellent A2 sentence structure and vocabulary control, this loss of specific meaning is a critical failure against the diagnostic protocol.\n\nSuggestion: You must find an A2-compliant way to express the concept of 'pest'. The word 'problem' is not specific enough. Rephrase the final sentence to better capture the original's meaning. For example: 'Or do people think they are animals that cause trouble?'"

This indicates a slight but critical loss of the original text's core meaning.\n\n- The primary failure is in the translation of the final question. The original asks if animals are 'welcome' or a 'pest'.\n- Your version asks if people 'like them' or if they are 'animals that cause trouble'.\n- The concept of 'welcome' implies a broader societal acceptance, which is not fully captured by the simpler emotional term 'like'.\n- The term 'pest' carries a specific meaning of a destructive nuisance animal, which is more precise than the general phrase 'animals that cause trouble'. This change, while a good simplification strategy, was enough to lower the meaning preservation score below the passing threshold.\n- Despite this failure, the text's vocabulary and sentence structure are otherwise compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final questions to better capture the original meaning. For example: 'Are people happy to see these animals? Or do they think the animals are a problem?' This phrasing uses simple A2 vocabulary while staying closer to the original concepts."

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text begins with an impersonal, factual statement: 'Small animals... are a common sight'. Your version, 'You can often see...', changes this to a direct address to the reader. This alters the tone from a general observation to a personal one, causing a significant meaning shift.\n- Secondary Deviation: The original asks if animals are 'considered a danger or a pest'. The word 'considered' implies a collective, societal judgment. Your replacement, 'people think', reduces this to individual opinion, losing the original nuance.\n- Structural Integrity: While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with A2 standards, the failure to maintain the original text's impersonal and observational tone is a critical error.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to remove the direct address 'you'. The opening sentence must be a general statement. Restore the concept of collective judgment instead of individual thought. Example: 'It is common to see small animals in cities...' and 'Are these animals seen as a danger or a problem?'"

The use of present simple, past simple ('There were...'), and present continuous ('are coming') is correct and appropriate.\n\n- Appropriate Connectors: The use of 'and', 'but', and 'or' is executed perfectly for the A2 level without introducing higher-level conjunctions.\n\n- CEFR Metrics: The text correctly registered as A2 with the classifier. It also showed high fidelity to the original source with a BERTScore of 0.9572 and a MeaningBERT score of 0.8217, both well within the required thresholds. The submission is exemplary."
