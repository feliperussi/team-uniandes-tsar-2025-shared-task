    "text_translated": "Small animals are common in cities and towns. For example, there are birds, squirrels, mice and insects. But in the last few years, newspapers and TV news have stories about wild animals. More and more wild animals are coming into cities. There were bears in parks in Vancouver. There were leopards on the streets of Mumbai. And there were wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Are these animals welcome? Or are they a danger or a problem?",

Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The simplification of 'press' to 'newspapers and TV news' and 'pest' to 'problem' is exemplary. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only A2-appropriate connectors. The grammatical simplification of the present perfect tense ('have been') to the past simple ('were') is correct for the target level. No deviations were found.",
