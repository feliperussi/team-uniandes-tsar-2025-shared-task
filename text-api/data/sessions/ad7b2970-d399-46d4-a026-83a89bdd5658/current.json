    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a factually accurate representation of the original text. No information was lost or altered.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics are excellent. MeaningBERT at 0.9452 and BERTScore at 0.9052 confirm that the core meaning and key lexical items have been preserved with high fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier result is correctly A2. The text avoids B1 complexity while maintaining sufficient detail.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. Simplifications such as 'frustration' to 'upset' and 'collaborate' to 'work together' are exemplary. Sentence structure is simple, direct, and broken into short, easily digestible lines. The submission is a model of A2 simplification.",
