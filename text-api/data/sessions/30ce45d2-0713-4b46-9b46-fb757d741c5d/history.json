        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5955 is too low (below the required 0.75). The core message regarding the specific functions of zoos, such as providing a 'safeguard' against 'genetically similar' populations and the strategic nature of 'breeding programmes', has been significantly diluted or lost in the simplification. The original text conveys a more nuanced understanding of conservation efforts that is not fully captured.\n\n*   Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8647 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. For example, 'international breeding programmes' was simplified to 'help animals have babies. This is for many countries.', and 'increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar' was reduced to 'animals become too much alike. This is a problem for their family.'\n*   Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'species' (B1) is used repeatedly throughout the text. While it was defined at the beginning, for a strict A2 level, consistent use of a B1 word is a deviation. Simpler alternatives like 'animal group' or 'kind of animal' should be used more frequently after the initial definition.\n*   Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'rare' (B1) is used in 'some species are very rare.' This word is above the A2 level.\n*   Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'hunt' (B1) is used in 'bad people hunt them.' This word is above the A2 level.\n*   Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'alike' (B1) is used in 'animals become too much alike.' This word is above the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to ensure the strategic and protective aspects of zoo functions are clearly conveyed, using A2 vocabulary. Specifically, restore the concepts of 'programmes' and 'safeguard' in A2 terms. Replace all B1 vocabulary with A2 equivalents or simpler phrases. Ensure the lexical fidelity to the original's key terms is higher.",

While the meaning is conveyed, the specific terminology is lost. MeaningBERT (0.7404) is below the 0.75 threshold. The original text emphasizes 'One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes'. Your version states 'Zoos do important work now. They have special plans.' This slightly reduces the emphasis on 'modern functions' and the direct link to 'international breeding programmes' as the primary function. Corrective Path: Rephrase to retain more of the original text's specific vocabulary while still simplifying sentence structure. For example, try to keep 'international breeding programmes' and define it, rather than replacing it entirely.

The text has failed to retain the core message and lexical detail of the original, resulting in a significant loss of information and nuance. The extensive simplification has rendered the output inadequate for an A2 audience seeking to understand the original content. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5452 is far below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe degradation of the original meaning. For example, the critical concept of 'genetically similar' was reduced to 'too much the same', and 'genetic diversity' to 'more different', which are vague and lose the specific scientific meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8672 is below the required 0.90. This demonstrates a significant loss of key vocabulary and factual phrasing. Terms like 'modern functions', 'supporting international breeding programmes', 'particularly for endangered species', 'habitat', and 'populations becoming too genetically similar' were either omitted or replaced with overly simplistic and less precise phrasing. Suggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification strategy. Prioritize the preservation of core concepts and key vocabulary. If a term is complex, define it simply, but do not replace it with a vague approximation that sacrifices meaning. Ensure that the output maintains a MeaningBERT score of at least 0.75 and a BERTScore of at least 0.90 to accurately reflect the original text's content.",

Your extensive simplification has diluted the core message, particularly the emphasis on the 'functions' of zoos and the precise concept of 'genetic diversity'. The BERTScore of 0.8627 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing from the original text. While simplification is necessary for A2, the replacement of specific terms with overly general or fragmented phrases has resulted in a lack of lexical fidelity. For example, 'international breeding programmes' was broken into multiple sentences ('help animals have babies. This is called a breeding programme. These programmes are for animal species in danger. Many countries work together on these plans.'), losing the direct lexical connection and the cohesive concept. Similarly, 'increase genetic diversity' was replaced with 'These new animals are not like family to the wild animals. This makes the animal species stronger.' While an A2 explanation, it deviates too much lexically from the original. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific terminology where possible, while still simplifying the sentence structure. Ensure that the core concepts, such as the 'functions' of zoos and the specific benefit of 'genetic diversity', are clearly and concisely conveyed, even with simpler words. Do not fragment key concepts into too many separate sentences, as this can dilute the overall meaning and lexical density.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The writer's output introduces information not present in the original text. The original states 'there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar', but the writer adds 'When animals are too similar, they can get sick easily'. This is an elaboration not found in the source. Additionally, the original states 'to increase genetic diversity', but the writer adds 'This makes the animal species stronger and healthier', which is an interpretation of the benefit, not a direct fact from the original. These additions violate the principle of factual integrity. Further deviations from the standard include: Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5741 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and the functional relationships between concepts, such as the link between international breeding programmes, endangered species, and genetic diversity as a safeguard. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8629 is below the required 0.90. This demonstrates a significant loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing from the original text due to oversimplification and replacement of specific terms. CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This indicates the text is too complex for the target level. Specific issues include the repeated use of the B1 vocabulary item 'species'. Also, the sentence 'When animals are too similar, they can get sick easily' uses a subordinate clause ('When...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. Suggestion: Remove all added explanatory details and focus strictly on simplifying the facts presented in the original text. Rephrase sentences to use only A2 vocabulary and simple, independent clauses. Ensure all key concepts and their relationships are preserved without adding new information or interpretations.",
