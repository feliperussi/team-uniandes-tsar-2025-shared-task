But we must be careful with this knowledge. We should keep it in the back of our minds. We must not use it to make stereotypes. A `stereotype` is a simple idea about a group of people. These ideas are often wrong. Stereotypes can break good business relationships.\n\nA country's `culture` is important. But many other things also make a person. Their region is important. Their groups are important. Their age is important. If they are a man or a woman is also important. Their company and their own life are important too.\n\nSo, we should remember these differences. But we must not think all people from a country are the same. We must see every person as an individual.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5787 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The text has failed its primary purpose of preserving the original message.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The low MeaningBERT score indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The original's nuanced warning about balancing awareness with the dangers of stereotyping was lost in the oversimplification.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8672 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'pigeonhole the individuals' and 'detrimental' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same weight, resulting in a loss of lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n- B1 Grammar: The sentence 'If they are a man or a woman is also important' uses a noun clause as the subject. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n- C1 Vocabulary: The word 'stereotype' is C1 level. Defining a complex word is not a substitute for explaining the concept using A2 vocabulary. This word must be removed.\n- B1+ Idiom: The phrase 'in the back of our minds' is an idiom above the A2 level and must be simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the entire text. Remove the word 'stereotype' and explain the concept simply. Eliminate the B1 noun clause structure; rephrase as 'Their gender is also important.' Remove the idiom 'in the back of our minds' and replace it with a literal A2 phrase like 'something to remember'. The text must be fundamentally re-engineered to meet A2 standards.",
