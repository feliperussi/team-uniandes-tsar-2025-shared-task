This is an instant failure. The text is too structurally complex for the A2 level.\n- B1 Structural Violation: The text repeatedly uses B1 grammatical structures. Examples include: 'It is what they think and do' (what-clause), 'The part of a country we are from' (relative clause), and 'it is good to know that people can be different' (that-clause). These structures are not permitted at the A2 level.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'making' is used in the phrase 'making good business relationships'. This word is not on the A2 list and is unacceptable.\n\nSuggestion: The text requires a complete rewrite. You must restore the original meaning regarding the proper use of cultural knowledge. Eliminate all complex sentences. Break down every sentence containing a relative clause, 'that'-clause, or 'what'-clause into two or more simple A2 sentences. Replace the word 'making' with an A2-compliant verb like 'to have' or 'to build'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the catastrophic loss of meaning and fidelity, confirmed by metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5939 is far below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8692 is below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates the core message was not preserved.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text gives a nuanced warning that stereotypes are 'detrimental to building good business relationships' and should not be used to 'pigeonhole' individuals. Your version reduces this to 'Stereotypes are bad for business relationships', which is a severe oversimplification that loses the original's specific meaning.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification is caused by grammatical structures that are too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Grammatical Structures: You used multiple structures above the A2 level. For example, 'The region we come from is important' is a relative clause. 'If we are a man or a woman is also important' uses a subordinate clause as the subject of the sentence. '...think all people from a country are the same' uses a that-clause. These are all B1 structures.\n\n- C1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'stereotype' is C1 level. Its inclusion in an A2 text is a critical error, regardless of the provided definition. The concept itself must be explained using only A1/A2 vocabulary.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the entire text. You must eliminate the C1 word 'stereotype' and explain the concept using simple A2 words like 'a simple, often untrue idea about a group'. You must break down all B1 sentences into simple A2 sentences. For example, instead of 'The region we come from is important', write 'Where we live is important.' Restore the original's meaning about the *damage* stereotypes cause, not just that they are 'bad'.",

The specific concept of 'pigeonholing' was lost entirely.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8769 is below the required 0.90. This failure is a direct result of removing key lexical items from the original text, such as 'awareness', 'miscommunication', 'expectations', and 'influenced'. Replacing these specific terms with generic A2 words like 'know', 'problems', and 'change' destroyed the fidelity of the text.\n\n- Conclusion: While the output successfully uses A2 vocabulary and sentence structures, it does so at the expense of the original message's integrity. The primary goal of simplification is to retain meaning at a lower CEFR level, not to erase it.\n\n- Suggestion: You must re-write the text to preserve the original concepts. Restore the idea of 'causing serious problems' for business instead of just 'very bad'. You must find a simple A2-level way to explain the concept of stereotyping or 'pigeonholing', for example: 'using one simple idea for a whole group of people'.",

The text has lost the core nuance and warning of the original. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8739 is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a significant loss of key phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text warns that stereotypes are 'detrimental' and that knowledge should be kept at the 'back of our minds' to avoid 'pigeonholing' people. Your version weakens this to 'can cause serious problems' and 'should not use it to think all people... are the same'. This is a critical loss of meaning and urgency.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The text is structurally too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Grammatical Structures Detected:\n  - Gerund as subject: 'Using stereotypes can cause...' is a B1 structure. An A2 structure would be 'It is bad to use stereotypes.'\n  - Subordinate clause as subject: 'If we are a man or a woman is also important.' This is a highly complex B1 structure.\n  - Adverbial clause of time: '...when we talk to people...' is a B1 structure.\n  - Reduced relative clause: 'The region we come from...' is a B1 structure. A2 requires simpler phrasing like 'The region is important. We come from this region.'\n\n- Vocabulary Failure: The word 'stereotype' is C1 level. While you have defined it, its repeated use contributes to the overall complexity that pushed the text into the B1 category.\n\nSuggestion: The text requires a complete rewrite. You must restore the original's strong warning about the dangers of stereotypes. Eliminate all B1 grammatical structures.

The MeaningBERT score confirms this critical failure.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because key lexical items from the original were completely lost. Concepts like 'detrimental', 'pigeonhole', 'corporate culture', and 'communities we associate with' were not simplified; they were erased. This is not simplification; it is omission.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is incorrectly classified as B1, not A2. This is due to unacceptable sentence complexity.

The text has failed to preserve the core message of the original source. This is an instant and non-negotiable failure.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.87 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. Key concepts from the original text such as 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', and 'pigeonhole' were completely lost, resulting in a text that is lexically unfaithful to the source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. The text is too complex. This is a direct violation of the primary objective.\n\n- B1 Structural Violation: The sentence \"Using these simple ideas can be bad for business relationships\" uses a gerund phrase as the subject. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is unacceptable for A2.\n\n- B1 Structural Violation: The sentence \"The region they come from is important\" uses a reduced relative clause. This is a B1 structure. An A2 text must use simpler constructions.\n\n- B1 Structural Violation: The sentence \"It is also important if a person is a man or a woman\" uses 'if' to introduce a noun clause. This is a B1 structure.\n\n- Suggestion: The text requires a complete rewrite. You must focus on restoring the original meaning while using only simple A2 sentence structures. Break down all complex ideas. For example, instead of \"Using these simple ideas can be bad...\", write \"Do not use these simple ideas. They can be bad for business.\" Simplify all B1 clauses immediately.",

The output fails to capture the core message of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text emphasizes a nuanced balance: use cultural awareness as background knowledge but do not use it to 'pigeonhole' people. Your version reduces this to a simplistic 'know about cultures but do not use stereotypes', losing the critical concept of how to apply the knowledge correctly. The score of 0.59 confirms this severe loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8711 is below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key lexical items from the original source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is rated B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The text is too complex for the target level.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'communication' is B1 level. The word 'gender' is B1 level. These are not permitted.\n\n- B1 Structural Violation: The text uses relative clauses, which are a B1 structure. The phrases 'make a person who they are' and 'The groups they belong to' are too complex for A2.\n\n- Suggestion: The text requires a complete rewrite. First, restore the original meaning about using cultural knowledge carefully in the background. Second, eliminate all B1 vocabulary. Replace 'communication problems' with 'problems when we talk'. Replace 'gender' with 'if they are a man or a woman'. Third, remove all B1 grammar. Rephrase 'make a person who they are' to 'make a person'. Rephrase 'The groups they belong to' to 'Their groups'.",
