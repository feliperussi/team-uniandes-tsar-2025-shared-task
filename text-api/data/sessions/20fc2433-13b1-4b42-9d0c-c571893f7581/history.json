This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.882 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key phrasing.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text presents a contrast between 'coincidence' and 'prophecy'. Your version explains coincidence but fails to include the opposing idea of prophecy (seeing the future), which is central to the original meaning. This is why the MeaningBERT score is low.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'coincidence' is B2 level. You are required to use A2 vocabulary. Defining a B2 word is not a substitute for using an A2 word. The phrase 'happened by chance' should have been used instead of the word 'coincidence'.\n- Lexical Loss: The phrase 'death of someone close' was simplified to 'someone you know dies'. This simplification, while understandable, contributes to the low BERTScore by losing lexical fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to explicitly state the contrast. For example: 'You may think your dream can tell you the future, but it cannot.' Remove the B2 word 'coincidence' and use the A2 phrase 'it happened by chance' directly. Restore the concept of 'forgetting' as a deliberate choice, as implied by the original's 'we probably choose to forget'.",
