    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standards.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: The output is factually identical to the original text. The core concepts of dreams as coincidence and the act of forgetting unfulfilled dreams are perfectly preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Words such as 'death', 'likely', and 'chance' are appropriate for this level.\n- Structural Simplicity: The original complex sentence has been correctly deconstructed into a series of short, simple sentences. This is the required structure for A2.\n- Metrics: All metrics are well above the minimum thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.83 and BERTScore at 0.91 confirm that meaning and key terms were retained with high fidelity.\n\nThis output is a model example of A2 simplification. No corrections are required.",
