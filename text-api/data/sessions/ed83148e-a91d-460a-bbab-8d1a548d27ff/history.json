        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for this failure is the critically low MeaningBERT score of 0.6423, which is significantly below the required threshold of 0.75. This score indicates that the core meaning and nuance of the original text were lost during the simplification process. The original text's emphasis on 'nuances and expectations' and the severe consequences of 'breakdowns in communication' was diluted into overly simplistic and generic phrases like 'rules' and 'cause problems'. The specific benefit of being 'in good stead' was weakened to the generic 'can help you'.\n\nAdditional detected deviations:\n\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The word 'means' is classified as B2 and is unacceptable for an A2 text. It was used in the definition: 'Etiquette means the polite rules...'. This is a clear violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\n*   **Structural Complexity:** The sentence 'You might think bad things that are not true' uses a relative 'that-clause'. While simple, this structure pushes the upper boundary of A2 and can often be simplified further to ensure compliance.\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n1.  **Restore Meaning:** Re-read the original to capture the lost concepts. The text must convey the subtlety of cultural expectations, not just 'rules'. The negative outcomes must be described with more gravity than just 'problems'.\n2.  **Eliminate B2 Vocabulary:** Immediately replace 'means' in the definition. The required phrasing is 'Etiquette is the polite rules...'.\n3.  **Simplify Structure:** Rephrase the relative clause. Instead of 'think bad things that are not true', use a simpler A2 construction like 'You might have wrong ideas about people'."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message during simplification. The output dilutes the severity of the consequences and the nuance of the original phrasing.\n\n*   **Meaning Dilution:** The original text warns of specific negative outcomes: 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication.' Your version generalizes this to 'big problems' and 'wrong ideas about people', which loses the specific, harsh tone of the original.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The B1-level word 'cultural' was used in 'cultural differences'. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. The word must be removed or the concept rephrased using only A2 vocabulary.\n*   **Structural Complexity:** The sentence 'But how people expect you to talk and act in business is very different in each culture' uses a noun clause ('how people expect you to talk and act') as the subject. This is a B1-level grammatical structure and is too complex for A2 readers.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n*   Suggestion: Restore the original meaning's severity. Instead of 'big problems', rephrase to convey the concepts of being judged unfairly and communication stopping completely.\n*   Suggestion: Remove the word 'cultural'. Rephrase 'cultural differences' to 'differences between cultures' or 'how people do things in different countries'.\n*   Suggestion: Deconstruct the complex sentence. Split it into two or more simple sentences. For example: 'People in different cultures expect different things. The way you talk and act in business can be very different.'"
