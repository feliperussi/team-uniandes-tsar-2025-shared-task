This sentence should be broken into two or three simpler sentences. For example: 'NEOCam is a space telescope that looks for asteroids.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as C1, which is too complex for the B1 target. The primary reason is the high sentence complexity. For example, the first sentence, 'NASA can only find the remaining middle\u2011sized near\u2011Earth objects if it receives funding to build NEOCam (Near\u2011Earth Object Camera), a 0.5\u2011metre infrared space telescope that can locate asteroids,' combines a conditional clause, an infinitive clause, and a relative clause, making it difficult for a B1 reader. Similarly, the final sentence uses multiple clauses and advanced structures. Suggestion: Break down these long sentences into shorter, more direct ones. For instance, the first sentence could be split into: 'NASA needs funding to find the remaining middle-sized near-Earth objects. This funding is for a project called NEOCam, which is a special telescope.' Despite this failure, the submission successfully maintained factual integrity and preserved the original meaning, as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores.",

The final sentence, 'After the asteroids are logged, the planetary defence team will still have to determine how to protect the planet from the most dangerous ones, called PHAs,' is the likely cause. This single sentence combines several complex structures (a subordinate time clause, a modal verb phrase, a wh-clause, and a reduced relative clause) which pushes the text into the B2 level. Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two simpler ones, such as: 'After the asteroids are logged, the planetary defence team must determine how to protect the planet.
