    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. This is likely due to the repeated use of the passive voice ('would be used', 'is approved', 'are logged') and formal vocabulary such as 'determine'. To correct this, rewrite sentences using the active voice. For example, 'The team would use the money to build NEOCam...' and 'After the team logs the asteroids...'. Consider replacing 'determine' with a simpler B1 alternative like 'decide' or 'work out'. On a positive note, the submission is factually accurate and successfully preserves the original meaning, as shown by the high MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics.",
