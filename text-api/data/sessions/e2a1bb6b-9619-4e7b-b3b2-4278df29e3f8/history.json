        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for this failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.7004, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. While the text is factually accurate and structurally simple, the over-simplification has stripped the original text of its core dramatic tone.\n\n*   **Meaning Dilution:** The original text uses powerful words like 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', and 'trapped' to create a sense of high drama and peril. Your output replaces these with 'very special', 'ship sinks', and 'He is on a small boat'. This neutral language fails to preserve the original's intense meaning, which the low MeaningBERT score correctly identifies.\n*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is appropriately A2. The simplification of 'diplomat' to 'father had a special job. He worked for his country in other countries' is a good example of A2-level explanation.\n*   **Structure:** The use of short, simple, declarative sentences is structurally compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification was too aggressive. You must re-introduce the sense of danger and being unable to escape. Rephrase 'He is on a small boat' to something like 'He is stuck on a small boat' to better reflect the original meaning of 'trapped'. The goal is simplification, not sanitization of meaning."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7097 is below the minimum required threshold of 0.75. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n*   **Primary Violation:** The simplification of the B2-level word 'diplomat' is the cause of the failure. The replacement, 'had a special job. He worked for his country in other countries,' is too vague and loses the specific, high-status meaning of the original term. This significantly alters the description of the author's background.\n*   **Structural Compliance:** The text correctly uses short, simple sentences and appropriate A2-level connectors. The CEFR classifier correctly rated the output as A2.\n*   **Vocabulary Compliance:** The vocabulary is otherwise within A2 limits.\n\n**Suggestion:** Do not oversimplify to the point of losing essential meaning. When encountering a difficult but important word like 'diplomat', define it in simple A2 terms instead of replacing it with a vague description. Rephrase to: 'Martel's father was a diplomat. This is an important job where he worked for his country in other places.'"
