Wasfia has given her life to supporting human rights, and she has seen many of these projects in her home country. These projects teach and teach skills to women and girls, but too many times, when the projects stopped continuing, the women were left with nothing. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to help itself, so she combined two things she loves: mountain climbing and human rights. She did this to try and change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing when she was working on humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal, because Bangladesh is a country near the sea and it is mostly flat, so most people there have never seen a mountain. Her project seems to be working well, as people from her country are paying attention, and the rest of the world is noticing too.",

The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, indicating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer effectively handled the keyword 'humanitarian' by providing a clear and helpful definition at the beginning of the text, which significantly aids comprehension for a B1 audience. Vocabulary simplification was consistently strong, replacing more complex phrases like 'dedicated her life' with 'given her life,' 'once too often' with 'too many times,' and 'doing the trick' with 'working well.' Sentence structures were appropriately simplified without losing the original nuance. A minor area for improvement is the phrase 'These projects teach and teach skills to women and girls.' The repetition of 'teach' is redundant. This could be simplified to 'These projects teach skills to women and girls' or 'These projects educate and train women and girls' to improve conciseness. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that effectively meets the B1 CEFR target while maintaining the core message and details of the original text.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8439) and BERTScore (0.9239) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. Qualitatively, the simplification is outstanding. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'humanitarian' at the outset, which greatly aids B1 comprehension. Complex vocabulary and idiomatic expressions, such as 'dedicated her life' to 'given her life,' 'stand up for itself' to 'help itself,' 'passions' to 'things she loves,' 'set eyes on' to 'seen,' and 'doing the trick' to 'working well,' were skillfully simplified. Sentence structures were appropriately adjusted for a B1 audience, maintaining a clear and logical flow throughout the text. This is a highly effective and well-executed simplification.",
