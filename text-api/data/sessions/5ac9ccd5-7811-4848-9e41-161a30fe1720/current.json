    "text_translated": "Humanitarian projects are projects that help people who are suffering, for example, because of war or natural disasters. Wasfia has given her life to supporting human rights, and she has seen many of these projects in her home country. These projects educate and train women and girls, but too many times, when the projects stopped continuing, the women were left with nothing. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to help itself, so she combined two things she loves: mountain climbing and human rights. She did this to try and change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing when she was working on humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal, because Bangladesh is a country near the sea and it is mostly flat, so most people there have never seen a mountain. Her project seems to be working well, as people from her country are paying attention, and the rest of the world is noticing too.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all simplification requirements. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies from the original text. Both MeaningBERT (0.8439) and BERTScore (0.9239) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. Qualitatively, the simplification is outstanding. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'humanitarian' at the outset, which greatly aids B1 comprehension. Complex vocabulary and idiomatic expressions, such as 'dedicated her life' to 'given her life,' 'stand up for itself' to 'help itself,' 'passions' to 'things she loves,' 'set eyes on' to 'seen,' and 'doing the trick' to 'working well,' were skillfully simplified. Sentence structures were appropriately adjusted for a B1 audience, maintaining a clear and logical flow throughout the text. This is a highly effective and well-executed simplification.",
