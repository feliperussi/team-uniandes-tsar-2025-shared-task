The core message of the original text, which emphasizes the 'logging' of asteroids and the 'unaccounted for' status of 17,000 large asteroids as a 'serious danger', is not fully preserved. Your version uses 'looking for' and 'not known', which dilutes the specific implication of systematic tracking and the inherent risk of untracked objects. The strong causal link and the urgency of the 'serious danger' from the original are weakened to 'can be very dangerous'. This loss of nuance in the central message is unacceptable.",
