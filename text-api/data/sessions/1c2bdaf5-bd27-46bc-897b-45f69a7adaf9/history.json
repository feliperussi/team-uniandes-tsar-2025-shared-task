Your simplification to 'can hurt' drastically reduces the severity of the warning, which is a central point of the original argument.\n- Disconnected Argument: The original directly links the 'problem' to the 'attack on Enlightenment values'. Your version separates these ideas into different paragraphs, weakening the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Add a simple sentence to explain 'fatalism', for example, 'They tell people that the future will be bad and they cannot change it.'

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core argument of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text presents a direct causal link: the problem IS the attack on Enlightenment values. Your version separates these concepts, stating there is a problem and then separately describing the Enlightenment. This severs the core argument and reduces its impact, causing the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8911 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a result of replacing too many key terms. The loss of concepts like 'human progress', 'institutions', and 'democracy' in favor of generic phrases like 'things to get better' and 'important things' compromises lexical fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'damage' is a B1-level verb. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. It must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the central argument that the 'big problem' IS the attack on the ideas of reason and science. Replace the word 'damage' with an A2 alternative such as 'hurt'. Re-introduce the concept of 'democracy' in simple terms, for example, 'the way people choose their government', which you did correctly, but apply this principle to other lost concepts to improve fidelity.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.891 falling short of the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text establishes a direct cause-and-effect relationship: when leaders attack reason (cause), institutions like democracy are damaged (effect). Your version separates these two points into different paragraphs, weakening this critical logical link and failing to preserve the core argument.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low because key concepts were oversimplified, losing necessary detail. The term 'human progress' was reduced to 'things to get better'. The phrase 'Enlightenment values... are under attack' lost its force. This loss of specific vocabulary contributed to the drop in fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary: The use and definition of the B1 word 'democracy' was an acceptable strategy. However, this does not compensate for the fundamental failure to preserve the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to explicitly connect the attack on ideas with the danger to democracy within the same logical flow. Restore the concept of 'progress' as it is central to the original author's point. The cause-and-effect structure is not optional; it is the main point of the text and must be preserved.",
