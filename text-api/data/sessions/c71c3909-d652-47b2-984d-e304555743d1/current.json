    "text_translated": "Genes are units of information in our bodies. Scientists are still asking questions about them and how they influence our brains and how we develop language. They also want to know if specific changes in these genes made us able to use language. A mutation is a change in a gene. Researchers have found a mutation in one of these genes. This change happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. It seems to be linked to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It is too early to say how much these genes affect language. But one day the answers might be found in our DNA. DNA is the material in our bodies that carries information about how we are made.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the retention of the word 'undergo' in the sentence 'Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.' The term 'undergo' is explicitly listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate, indicating it should have been simplified for a B1 audience. To achieve B1 compliance, consider replacing 'undergo' with a simpler phrase such as 'experience' or 'have' (e.g., 'but it did not have this mutation' or 'but this mutation did not happen to it'). While the definitions for 'genes', 'mutation', and 'DNA' are helpful additions for clarity, the vocabulary choice for 'undergo' elevates the text beyond the B1 target.",
