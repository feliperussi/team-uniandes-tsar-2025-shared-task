The sentence structures are predominantly simple or simple compound sentences, without the more varied clause structures (e.g., more complex relative clauses, conditional sentences) typically found at B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating definitions more subtly or expecting the reader to infer meaning from context for some terms. Introduce a greater variety of sentence structures, perhaps by combining some ideas with B1-level conjunctions (e.g., although, however, therefore) or using more embedded clauses without explicit 'which is' definitions. For instance, instead of 'changes in genes, called mutations', one might rephrase to 'changes in genes, known as mutations,' or integrate the definition more fluidly if the term is repeated.",

The primary reason for this classification is the length and complexity of several sentences, as well as the presence of B2-level vocabulary that was not sufficiently simplified or contextualized for B1. For example, the sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.' is very long and contains multiple clauses, making it challenging for a B1 reader. Similarly, the sentence 'It is too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA, which is the material in our bodies that carries genetic information.' is also lengthy and includes the B2 term 'genetic information'. While 'mutation' and 'DNA' were defined, the term 'genes' itself is classified as B2, and its frequent use, combined with complex sentence structures, elevates the overall CEFR level. To improve, break down long sentences into two or more shorter, simpler sentences. Rephrase complex clauses and ensure that even defined terms are used within a generally simpler grammatical framework. For instance, the sentence about the gene mutation could be split into: 'Researchers have found a gene mutation. It happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.'",

While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9453, BERTScore: 0.9202), the output is too simple for a B1 audience. This is primarily due to excessive sentence splitting and overly explicit definitions that reduce the overall complexity to an A2 level. For example, the original sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' was split into three very short sentences: 'Researchers have found a gene mutation. It happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.' This significantly lowers the grammatical complexity. Additionally, the explicit definition 'Our DNA is the material in our bodies. It carries information about us.' is more characteristic of A2-level instruction. To achieve a B1 level, consider combining some of the split sentences using B1-appropriate relative clauses (e.g., 'which', 'that') or conjunctions. Also, integrate definitions more subtly or assume a slightly higher level of prior knowledge for some terms, as B1 learners are expected to handle more complex sentence structures and infer meaning from context.",

They also want to know if specific changes in these genes made us able to use language. A mutation is a change in a gene. Researchers have found a mutation in one of these genes. This change happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. It seems to be linked to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It is too early to say how much these genes affect language. But one day the answers might be found in our DNA. DNA is the material in our bodies that carries information about how we are made.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the retention of the word 'undergo' in the sentence 'Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.' The term 'undergo' is explicitly listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate, indicating it should have been simplified for a B1 audience. To achieve B1 compliance, consider replacing 'undergo' with a simpler phrase such as 'experience' or 'have' (e.g., 'but it did not have this mutation' or 'but this mutation did not happen to it'). While the definitions for 'genes', 'mutation', and 'DNA' are helpful additions for clarity, the vocabulary choice for 'undergo' elevates the text beyond the B1 target.",
