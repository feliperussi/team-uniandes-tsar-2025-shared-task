    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6626 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Core Meaning Alteration: The original text states a factual design limit, 'the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight'. Your version changes this into a judgment, 'the design was the problem'. This is an interpretation, not a simplification, and it alters the intended meaning.\n- Concept Oversimplification: The professional concept of 'conduct a complete investigation' was reduced to 'study everything'. This loses the specific, procedural meaning of the original phrase.\n\nSuggestion:\n- Rephrase to restore factual accuracy. Replace 'the design was the problem' with a direct statement like 'The bridge was built to hold only a certain amount of weight.'\n- Do not interpret the source text. Your task is to simplify the existing information, not to add your own judgment or analysis.",
