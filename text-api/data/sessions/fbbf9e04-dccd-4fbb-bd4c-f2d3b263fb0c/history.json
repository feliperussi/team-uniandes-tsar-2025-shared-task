The original text establishes a direct link: engineers solve the mystery *after* an investigation. Your version separates these concepts into disconnected sentences (\"It is a mystery. Engineers do not know why. They have to study it carefully.\"), which weakens this crucial relationship.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'mystery' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary. A2 requires explaining the concept, not using the complex word.\n- Loss of Precision: While simplifying is necessary, changing 'designed only to support a certain amount of weight' to 'was made to hold a certain weight' contributes to the overall loss of meaning detected by the metric.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the cause-and-effect link between the investigation and the solution.

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text describes a formal 'complete investigation' by engineers. Your version, 'Engineers look at the problem very carefully', is too informal and loses the meaning of a systematic, professional process. The phrase 'inferior-quality material was used in the construction' is also more precise than your general statement 'the materials were poor quality', which contributes to the meaning loss. While the text is structurally simple and factually correct, the low meaning score is an instant failure. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Use language that reflects a professional study, for example: 'Engineers must study everything to find the reason.' For the materials, be more direct: 'The builders used poor quality materials.'",
