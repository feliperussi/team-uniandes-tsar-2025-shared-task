    "feedback": "PASS. This is an excellent simplification that successfully meets all B1 criteria. Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All key details are preserved. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.98) confirm that the core message and key phrasing have been maintained effectively. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as B1. Qualitative Analysis: The handling of the keyword 'tributes' is exemplary. Adding the sentence 'Tributes are the people selected to compete' provides a clear and direct definition for the target reader. The replacement of 'rebelling' with 'fighting against the government' is also a strong choice that clarifies the meaning without losing nuance. The overall text is clear, accurate, and well-structured for a B1 audience.",
