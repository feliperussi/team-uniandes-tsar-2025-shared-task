While the text successfully preserved all facts and the core meaning (MeaningBERT 0.875, BERTScore 0.98), the simplification strategy was flawed. The primary issue is in the final sentence. The original text used two clear, separate sentences. The output combined them into a single, long, and more complex sentence: 'The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\", which are the people selected to compete, and the whole nation is forced to watch the event on television.' This is the opposite of simplification and makes the text harder for a B1 reader to process. Actionable Suggestion: Revert to two separate sentences. Define the keyword 'tributes' in its own sentence for maximum clarity. For example: 'The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\". Tributes are the people selected to compete. The whole nation is forced to watch the event on television.' This change will improve readability and likely correct the CEFR classification.",

All key details are preserved. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.98) confirm that the core message and key phrasing have been maintained effectively. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as B1. Qualitative Analysis: The handling of the keyword 'tributes' is exemplary. Adding the sentence 'Tributes are the people selected to compete' provides a clear and direct definition for the target reader. The replacement of 'rebelling' with 'fighting against the government' is also a strong choice that clarifies the meaning without losing nuance. The overall text is clear, accurate, and well-structured for a B1 audience.",
