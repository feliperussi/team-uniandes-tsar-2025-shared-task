        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7178 is below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8825 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key factual words.\n\n-   Lexical Fidelity Loss: The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of meaning. The original text uses the specific verb 'drown'. Your replacement, 'die in the water', is factually correct but loses the specific cause of death, which is a critical detail. The word 'drown' is an acceptable A2-level verb.\n\n-   Meaning Dilution: The word 'tragically' was replaced with the repetitive and weak phrase 'It is very bad that...'. This simplification significantly dilutes the emotional weight and meaning of the original sentence.\n\n-   Over-simplification of Structure: The original text was broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. While A2 requires simple structures, this level of fragmentation makes the text choppy and contributes to the low metric scores by breaking the logical connections between ideas.\n\n-   Suggestion: Restore the A2-level verb 'drown' to improve fidelity. Rephrase to better capture the meaning of 'tragically'; for example, 'Sadly, Pi's family and the sailors drown.' Combine some of the shortest sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to improve readability and restore logical flow. For example: 'His parents do not support the government, so they are worried about the future.'",

It passes all diagnostic checks without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a 100% factually accurate representation of the original text.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.871 and BERTScore of 0.9114 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key lexical items were preserved successfully.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct and verified by qualitative analysis.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful control of A2 constraints. Complex sentences from the original were systematically and correctly broken down into simple, short sentences. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, with more complex words like 'emigrate' and 'tragically' correctly removed. The structural simplification is flawless.",
