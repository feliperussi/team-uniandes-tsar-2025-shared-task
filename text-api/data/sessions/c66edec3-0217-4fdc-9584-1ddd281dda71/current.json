It passes all diagnostic checks without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a 100% factually accurate representation of the original text.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.871 and BERTScore of 0.9114 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key lexical items were preserved successfully.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct and verified by qualitative analysis.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful control of A2 constraints. Complex sentences from the original were systematically and correctly broken down into simple, short sentences. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, with more complex words like 'emigrate' and 'tragically' correctly removed. The structural simplification is flawless.",
