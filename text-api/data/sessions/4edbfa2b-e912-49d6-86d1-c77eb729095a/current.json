    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained throughout the text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.83 and BERTScore of 0.92 are strong, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of best practice; providing a clear, embedded definition is exactly what is required for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the simplification of complex concepts like 'pigeonhole' to 'label... in the same way' and 'detrimental' to 'bad' is highly effective. The sentence structure is clear, and the use of connectors like 'However' and 'Therefore' ensures the text flows logically. No improvements are necessary.",
