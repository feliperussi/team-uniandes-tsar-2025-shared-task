While the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, the sentence structure is too complex for a B1 audience. The primary issue is the use of long sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the sentence 'However, it is also very important to remember that using cultural stereotypes, which are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like, can be bad for building good business relationships' contains an embedded non-defining relative clause that significantly increases its complexity. To meet the B1 requirement, this sentence should be split into two or more simpler sentences, such as: 'However, it is very important to remember that using cultural stereotypes can be bad for business relationships. Stereotypes are simple but often untrue ideas about a group of people.' Applying this strategy of breaking down long sentences throughout the text will help achieve the target B1 level.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.83 and BERTScore of 0.92 are strong, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of best practice; providing a clear, embedded definition is exactly what is required for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the simplification of complex concepts like 'pigeonhole' to 'label... in the same way' and 'detrimental' to 'bad' is highly effective. The sentence structure is clear, and the use of connectors like 'However' and 'Therefore' ensures the text flows logically. No improvements are necessary.",
