    "feedback": "This is a strong B1 performance. You have successfully combined two ideas into a single, correct compound sentence using 'but', which is an excellent demonstration of B1-level writing. Your vocabulary choices, such as using 'not very common' for 'relatively infrequent', are appropriate and maintain the original meaning. The text is factually accurate, though for a perfect score, remember to include all key details like 'in earthquake zones'.",
