    "text_translated": "I used to work a normal five-day week. After I had time off for my new baby, I decided I wanted to spend more time with my children before they started school. I talked with my boss, and we agreed to reduce my schedule to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay. This is because I am paid only for the number of days I work. However, I have noticed that my amount of work has not changed at all. Now I am doing five days of work in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it.",

    "feedback": "This text is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The structure and flow are very strong, demonstrating a clear ability to write simple, connected text. You effectively use a mix of sentence types, correctly employing connectors like 'After', 'because', and 'However' to link ideas logically. Your vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level. A key strength is your ability to paraphrase complex ideas; for example, explaining 'pro-rata basis' as 'because I am paid only for the number of days I work' shows strong comprehension and communicative skill. The text is coherent, factually accurate, and successfully describes the experience from the original text.",
