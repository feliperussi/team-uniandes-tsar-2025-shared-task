I talked with my boss, and we agreed to reduce my schedule to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay, because I am paid for the number of days I work. However, I have noticed that my amount of work has not changed at all. I am now doing five days of work in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it",

        "feedback_text": "This text is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The structure and flow are very strong, demonstrating a clear ability to write simple, connected text. You effectively use a mix of sentence types, correctly employing connectors like 'After', 'because', and 'However' to link ideas logically. Your vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level. A key strength is your ability to paraphrase complex ideas; for example, explaining 'pro-rata basis' as 'because I am paid only for the number of days I work' shows strong comprehension and communicative skill. The text is coherent, factually accurate, and successfully describes the experience from the original text."
