However bored and rebellious a teenage boy might get, it was not possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, which was kicking the ground with its heavy hooves. He wondered if the boy could ride, because a good rider could get into a lot of trouble out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8706) and BERTScore (0.9824) significantly exceeded their respective thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating successful adherence to the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very strong. The writer effectively combined sentences using relative clauses (e.g., 'The two men looked towards the northern end of the property, which stretched as far as the eye could see.'), converted direct speech to indirect speech ('He wondered if the boy could ride'), and simplified idiomatic expressions ('a whole load of trouble' to 'a lot of trouble'). A particularly good simplification was changing 'barely visible' (B2) to 'hardly visible' (B1), which aligns well with the vocabulary strategy. The text flows naturally, using appropriate B1 connectors, and maintains a consistent B1 level throughout. No keywords required definition, and the vocabulary candidates were handled appropriately. This is an excellent example of effective text simplification.",
