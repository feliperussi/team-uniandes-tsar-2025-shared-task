He wondered if the boy could ride a horse, because a good horse rider might get into a lot of trouble in this place, far from other people. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7233 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a slight but significant loss of the original text's nuanced meaning and descriptive power. For instance, the phrase 'It stretched as far as the eye could see' conveys an overwhelming sense of vastness and hopelessness for escape, which is diminished by the simplification to 'which was very big'. Furthermore, the specific character trait of a 'rebellious' teenage boy is generalized to simply 'wanted to get away', altering the subtle motivation and internal conflict implied in the original. While the main events are preserved, these changes reduce the depth and specific emotional context of the narrative. To improve, ensure that descriptive phrases and specific character motivations are retained or rephrased with equivalent impact, rather than being overly simplified.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8706) and BERTScore (0.9824) significantly exceeded their respective thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating successful adherence to the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very strong. The writer effectively combined sentences using relative clauses (e.g., 'The two men looked towards the northern end of the property, which stretched as far as the eye could see.'), converted direct speech to indirect speech ('He wondered if the boy could ride'), and simplified idiomatic expressions ('a whole load of trouble' to 'a lot of trouble'). A particularly good simplification was changing 'barely visible' (B2) to 'hardly visible' (B1), which aligns well with the vocabulary strategy. The text flows naturally, using appropriate B1 connectors, and maintains a consistent B1 level throughout. No keywords required definition, and the vocabulary candidates were handled appropriately. This is an excellent example of effective text simplification.",
