Panem has twelve poor districts and a rich city called the Capitol. The Capitol runs the whole country. Each district must make different things for the Capitol. District 12 gives all the coal (a black rock used for energy) to the country. There was also a thirteenth district. That district fought the Capitol, so it was destroyed.",
