This indicates that your output has deviated too far from the original text's phrasing and key terms. This is a critical failure.\n\n- Factual Addition: The first sentence, 'The Hunger Games is a fight competition for young people,' adds information that was not in the original text. Your task is to simplify existing information, not to introduce new facts.\n\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The text uses B1-level vocabulary. The words 'ruin', 'district', and 'coal' are not on the A2 word list. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'The Capitol is the rich city that rules the country' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 grammatical structure. This must be simplified.\n\n- Awkward Phrasing: The sentence 'Panem is the name after the old land is ruined' is grammatically awkward and unnatural for an A2 learner.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the first sentence. Replace all B1 words with A2 alternatives or break them down into simpler concepts. Split complex sentences into two or more simple sentences. For example, rewrite 'The Capitol is the rich city that rules the country' as 'The Capitol is a rich city. It rules the country.'",

This structure is more characteristic of an A1 text and results in a loss of natural flow and connection between ideas present in the original.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'coal' is classified as B1 level. Its inclusion without simplification or definition violates the strict A2 vocabulary standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the key term 'district' from the original text. Combine some of the short sentences to create a more natural A2-level structure. For example: 'The country is called Panem, and it has twelve poor districts and a rich city called the Capitol.' Address the B1 vocabulary item 'coal'.",
