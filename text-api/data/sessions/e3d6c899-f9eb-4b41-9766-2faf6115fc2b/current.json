    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.675 is below the required 0.75. The original text's core message is about the scientific inquiry into the influence of genetics and a specific gene mutation on language development. Your version begins with a general definition of genes ('Genes are special parts in our body. They tell our body what to do.'), which shifts the initial focus away from the scientific research question central to the original text. This dilutes the primary meaning of the original passage. The BERTScore of 0.9052 is acceptable, indicating lexical fidelity, but the overall meaning is not sufficiently preserved. Suggestion: Rephrase the beginning to immediately introduce the scientific questions about genes and language, rather than starting with a general definition. Ensure the emphasis remains on the research and the influence of genes on language development as presented in the original text.",
