        "feedback_text": "FAIL: B1 Level Contamination. The text fails the deep qualitative audit. While the metrics are acceptable, the output contains vocabulary and sentence structures that exceed the A2 standard.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'honestly' is B1 level. It is not on the A2 word list and must be removed.\n\n- Structural Violation: The text uses multiple 'that-clauses', which are a B1 grammatical structure. This level of sentence complexity is unacceptable for A2.\n\n- Specific Structural Errors:\n  - 'They thought she did not believe they could do their job well.' This uses an implied 'that-clause' ('They thought that...').\n  - 'The team saw that Gabriela was unhappy when they wanted to change her ideas.' This sentence combines a 'that-clause' with a 'when-clause', a clear B1 construction.\n  - 'But they explained that this was just their normal way to work.' This is another explicit 'that-clause'.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace 'honestly' with an A2 phrase. Example: 'They told her the truth.'\n\n- Suggestion: All sentences containing 'that-clauses' must be broken down into simple A2 sentences. Rephrase using direct speech or sequential simple statements. Example for 'they explained that...': 'They explained it. They said, \"This is our normal way to work.\"' Example for 'The team saw that...': 'Gabriela was unhappy when they wanted to change her ideas. The team saw this.'",

The words 'truth' and 'trust' are not on the A2 list.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the professional context of different work styles and leadership. Replace the B1 word 'truth' with an A2 phrase like 'what they really thought'. Replace the B1 word 'trust' with an A2 phrase like 'believe they could do the job well'.",

The original text states, 'They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or make changes to her decisions...'.\n- Your version, 'The team explained that they sometimes changed her ideas,' completely removes the crucial emotional context. The fact that Gabriela was 'taking it personally' is a key point of the original text, and its omission is a severe factual and meaningful error.\n- The word 'challenge' is also lost. Your simplification to 'changed her ideas' does not carry the same meaning of opposition or questioning that is central to the original conflict.\n\nSuggestion: The final section must be rewritten to restore the lost meaning. You must include the concept of Gabriela's personal feelings. Rephrase to state that the team saw Gabriela was unhappy when they disagreed with her or wanted to change her plans.",
