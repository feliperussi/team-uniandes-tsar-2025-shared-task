    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all stages of the diagnostic protocol.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. No information was lost or altered.\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.91 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were fully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2, meeting the target level precisely.\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'boss', 'unhappy', and 'normal' are appropriate A2 substitutions for more complex original terms.\n- Structural Analysis: Sentences are consistently short, direct, and use simple connectors appropriate for the A2 level. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",
