After these asteroids are recorded, the team that defends the planet would still need to find a way to defend it from the most worrying asteroids, which are called PHAs.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. While the writer made good efforts to simplify vocabulary and some sentence structures, the overall sentence length and the combination of multiple clauses within single sentences likely contributed to the B2 classification. For example, the sentence 'NEOCam is a 0.5-metre space telescope which would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids.' is long and contains both a relative clause and an appositive phrase. Similarly, 'After these asteroids are recorded, the team that defends the planet would still need to find a way to defend it from the most worrying asteroids, which are called PHAs.' combines a temporal clause with two relative clauses, making it structurally complex for B1. To achieve B1, consider splitting longer sentences into two or more shorter ones, especially those with multiple clauses. For instance, 'NEOCam is a 0.5-metre space telescope. It would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids.' This would improve readability and align better with B1 sentence complexity expectations.",
