The simplification strategy resulted in overly basic sentence structures and vocabulary, pushing the text into the A2 category. For example, the original's more complex dependency, 'Whether NASA can find... depends on getting the money...', was broken into two very simple sentences: 'NASA wants to find... But to do this, it needs money...' Additionally, the inclusion of explicit definitions like 'which are space rocks' for NEOs and 'a type of light we cannot see' for infrared light, while helpful for A2 learners, reduces the overall B1 complexity. To achieve a B1 level, the text should aim for a slightly more varied sentence structure, including some more complex sentences (e.g., using relative clauses without explicit rephrasing, or more sophisticated conjunctions) and a vocabulary that incorporates more B1-level words where appropriate, rather than always simplifying to A1/A2.

While the vocabulary choices were generally appropriate, the sentence structures are too long and contain too many embedded clauses for a B1 learner. For example, the sentence 'If NASA gets the money to build NEOCam, a 0.5-metre space telescope which would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids, it can find the remaining medium-sized NEOs' combines a conditional clause, an appositive phrase, and a relative clause, making it grammatically dense. A B1 text would benefit from splitting such complex sentences into shorter, more manageable units. For instance, it could be rephrased as: 'If NASA gets the money to build NEOCam, it can find the remaining medium-sized NEOs. NEOCam is a 0.5-metre space telescope. It would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids.' Similarly, the final sentence 'After these asteroids are recorded, the team that defends the planet would still need to find a way to defend it from the most worrying asteroids, which are called PHAs, because these could be dangerous' also contains multiple clauses that could be simplified by breaking them into two or three distinct sentences. The use of 'a special kind of light' to explain infrared light is a good simplification strategy, but it is overshadowed by the overall sentence complexity.",

However, the output incorrectly states 'These are called PHAs. They could be dangerous.' The phrase 'They could be dangerous' introduces a degree of uncertainty about the danger of PHAs that is not present in the original text. This alters the factual certainty conveyed by the source material. To correct this, the output should reflect the definite nature of the danger, for example, by stating 'These are called PHAs. They are dangerous.' or by directly linking them as 'the most worrying asteroids, which are called PHAs.'",

While the writer made good efforts to simplify vocabulary and some sentence structures, the overall sentence length and the combination of multiple clauses within single sentences likely contributed to the B2 classification. For example, the sentence 'NEOCam is a 0.5-metre space telescope which would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids.' is long and contains both a relative clause and an appositive phrase. Similarly, 'After these asteroids are recorded, the team that defends the planet would still need to find a way to defend it from the most worrying asteroids, which are called PHAs.' combines a temporal clause with two relative clauses, making it structurally complex for B1. To achieve B1, consider splitting longer sentences into two or more shorter ones, especially those with multiple clauses. For instance, 'NEOCam is a 0.5-metre space telescope. It would use infrared light, a special kind of light, to find asteroids.' This would improve readability and align better with B1 sentence complexity expectations.",
