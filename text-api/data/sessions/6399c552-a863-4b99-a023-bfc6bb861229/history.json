While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.8033, BERTScore: 0.9694), the linguistic choices made the text too simple for the target B1 audience. Several vocabulary items and sentence structures were simplified to an A2 level. For example, 'terrified' (B2) was changed to 'very scared' (A2), 'realises his only option is' (B2/C1) was simplified to 'which meant he had to' (A2/B1), 'Fortunately' (B2) became 'Luckily' (A2), and 'has no immediate interest in eating him' (B2) was reduced to 'did not want to eat him right away' (A2). To achieve a B1 classification, the text should reintroduce some B1-level vocabulary and slightly more complex sentence structures or connectors. For instance, consider using 'frightened' instead of 'very scared', retaining 'realises his only option is', or using 'was not immediately interested in eating him' instead of 'did not want to eat him right away'.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.9856) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and key lexical details. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The simplification strategy was subtle but effective. The consistent change of verb tenses from present to past (e.g., 'is terrified' to 'was frightened', 'kill and eat' to 'killed and ate') is a suitable adjustment for narrative texts, enhancing readability without altering meaning. The word 'terrified' was appropriately replaced with the slightly simpler synonym 'frightened', and 'till' was changed to 'until'. The phrase 'has no immediate interest' was effectively rephrased to 'was not immediately interested', simplifying the verb structure while maintaining full meaning. The use of the relative clause 'which made him jump' instead of 'and jumps' also contributes to a natural B1 flow and sentence variety. The text maintains excellent coherence and readability. No further improvements are strictly necessary, as the output meets all requirements with high quality.",
