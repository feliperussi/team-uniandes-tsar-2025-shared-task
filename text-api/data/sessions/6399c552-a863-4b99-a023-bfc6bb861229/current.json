But then he remembered that there were hungry sharks in the water around him and realised his only option was to climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat killed and ate each other, until only Pi and the tiger were left. Fortunately for Pi, the tiger, who he named Richard Parker, was seasick and was not immediately interested in eating him.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.9856) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and key lexical details. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The simplification strategy was subtle but effective. The consistent change of verb tenses from present to past (e.g., 'is terrified' to 'was frightened', 'kill and eat' to 'killed and ate') is a suitable adjustment for narrative texts, enhancing readability without altering meaning. The word 'terrified' was appropriately replaced with the slightly simpler synonym 'frightened', and 'till' was changed to 'until'. The phrase 'has no immediate interest' was effectively rephrased to 'was not immediately interested', simplifying the verb structure while maintaining full meaning. The use of the relative clause 'which made him jump' instead of 'and jumps' also contributes to a natural B1 flow and sentence variety. The text maintains excellent coherence and readability. No further improvements are strictly necessary, as the output meets all requirements with high quality.",
