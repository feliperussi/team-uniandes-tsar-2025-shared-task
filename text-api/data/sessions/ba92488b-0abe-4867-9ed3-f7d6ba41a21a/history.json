While the submission passed the critical checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation, it failed to meet the simplification goal. The primary reason for the B2 classification is the use of overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'In a lucid dream you are aware you are dreaming and you can make choices that affect what happens in the dream' is a compound-complex sentence, combining multiple clauses in a way that is more typical of a B2 level. To correct this, simplify the grammar by splitting complex sentences. Suggestion: Revise the sentence to 'In a lucid dream, you are aware that you are dreaming. You can also make choices that affect what happens in the dream.' This change breaks down the complex idea into two simpler, more accessible B1-level sentences.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and the metrics confirm this with a strong MeaningBERT score of 0.8871 and a BERTScore of 0.9346. The text correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The definition of the keyword 'lucid dreaming' is clear and effective. For improvement, focus on sentence flow. The text is slightly choppy due to repetition. For example, 'Lucid dreaming means you know you are dreaming. In a lucid dream you know you are dreaming.' could be combined into a single, more fluid sentence. Additionally, the sentence 'You do not only try to understand their meaning' is grammatically awkward and could be rephrased for clarity, such as 'This means you are not just trying to understand their meaning, but actively creating them.' These are stylistic refinements to an otherwise solid simplification.",
