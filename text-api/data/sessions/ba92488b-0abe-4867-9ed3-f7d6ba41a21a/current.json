    "text_translated": "Some people believe that writing your dreams down can help you have lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming means you know you are dreaming. In a lucid dream you know you are dreaming. You can also make choices that change what happens. For example, you can turn a nightmare into a safe feeling dream. You can also direct the plot of the dream like a film director. By doing this you can start to create your dreams. You do not only try to understand their meaning. You may still want some dreams that let your mind tell you what you are thinking.",

    "feedback": "The simplification is successful, passing all high-priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the metrics confirm this with a strong MeaningBERT score of 0.8871 and a BERTScore of 0.9346. The text correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The definition of the keyword 'lucid dreaming' is clear and effective. For improvement, focus on sentence flow. The text is slightly choppy due to repetition. For example, 'Lucid dreaming means you know you are dreaming. In a lucid dream you know you are dreaming.' could be combined into a single, more fluid sentence. Additionally, the sentence 'You do not only try to understand their meaning' is grammatically awkward and could be rephrased for clarity, such as 'This means you are not just trying to understand their meaning, but actively creating them.' These are stylistic refinements to an otherwise solid simplification.",
