This is an unacceptable deviation from factual integrity. FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6907 is below the required 0.75.

The phrase 'survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites' was simplified to 'He did not die. Only small flying insects bit him. And small insects bit him too. They bit him many times.', which loses the specific detail of 'mosquito and ant' and the scale of 'few thousand'. Suggestion: Remove all information not present in the original text. Rephrase to maintain the specific nature of dangers and the intensity of the experience as described in the original, while still using A2 vocabulary. For example, 'poisonous snakes' could be 'snakes that can kill you' or 'very bad snakes'. 'Constant danger' could be 'always in danger'.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and nuance of the original text. While the factual points are present, the emphasis and implications are lost. The most critical deviation is the simplification of the concluding statement. The original text states, 'Luckily, he survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites.' This conveys that despite extreme dangers, the worst outcome was relatively minor. Your version, 'But he was lucky. He did not die. Only mosquitoes and ants bit him. This was the only bad thing,' loses this crucial comparative nuance. It merely states facts without the implied contrast between the severe dangers and the minor injuries. This diminishes the sense of his extraordinary luck and the relative success of his survival against the odds. Suggestion: Rephrase the ending to clearly convey that the mosquito and ant bites were the *only* bad things, implying that he avoided the more severe dangers like snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars. For example: 'He was lucky. The only bad things were bites from mosquitoes and ants. He did not get hurt by the big animals.'",

Your version 'The only bad things were bites from mosquitoes and ants.

The phrase 'nothing worse than' in the original text conveys a specific comparative meaning that was not fully captured in the simplified version.\nDeviation 2: The simplification of 'stream' to 'river' is acceptable for A2, but 'stream' is also an A2 word and could have been retained for closer fidelity to the original text without increasing complexity.\nDeviation 3: The simplification of 'mouth' (of a river) to 'end' is acceptable for A2, but 'mouth' is also an A2 word in this context and could have been retained for closer fidelity to the original text without increasing complexity.\nDeviation 4: The simplification of 'rainforest' to 'big forest' is acceptable for A2, but 'rainforest' is also an A2 word and could have been retained for closer fidelity to the original text without increasing complexity.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about the bites to better convey the comparative meaning of 'nothing worse than'.
