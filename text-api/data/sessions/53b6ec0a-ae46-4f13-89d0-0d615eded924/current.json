    "feedback": "PASS: The text perfectly adheres to the CEFR A2 readability standard. All diagnostic checks were passed with exemplary results. Factual integrity is maintained without deviation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8293 and BERTScore of 0.9197 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been meticulously simplified, replacing B1 words like 'rainforest', 'poisonous', 'constant', and 'survived' with appropriate A1/A2 phrases such as 'big forest with much rain', 'snakes that can kill you', 'always in danger', and 'He was lucky. The bites... were the only bad things that happened. He did not get hurt by the big animals.' Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using only A2-level connectors like 'and' and 'so'. This is a flawless execution of the A2 simplification task.",
