    "text_translated": "A coincidence is when two things happen at the same time by chance. A prophecy is when someone says what will happen in the future. Sometimes you dream about a phone call from an old friend. Or you dream that someone close to you dies. This is probably a coincidence, not a prophecy. We dream about these things many times, but they do not happen. We probably choose to forget those dreams.",

    "feedback": "The text is a perfect example of A2 simplification. It correctly defines the necessary keywords ('coincidence', 'prophecy') at the beginning. All sentences are simple, declarative, and use high-frequency A2 vocabulary. The output is factually identical to the original text. No violations were found.",
