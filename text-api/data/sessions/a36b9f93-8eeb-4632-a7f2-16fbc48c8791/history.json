It contains multiple clauses. Factual inaccuracy detected: The original text states 'we probably choose to forget,' which is not the same as 'we probably forget.' Your version removes the concept of choice, altering the original meaning. Defining the keywords was the correct procedure, but it does not excuse these fundamental errors."
