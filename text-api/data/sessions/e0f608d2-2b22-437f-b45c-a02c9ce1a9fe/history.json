The failure is likely caused by the oversimplification of key concepts in the final sentence. The original's powerful verb 'empower' was replaced with the much weaker phrase 'support and encourage'. Similarly, the systemic idea of a country that 'discourages' women from sport was reduced to one that 'often tells them not to'. This dilution of meaning, while factually similar, changes the impact and intent of the original message.
