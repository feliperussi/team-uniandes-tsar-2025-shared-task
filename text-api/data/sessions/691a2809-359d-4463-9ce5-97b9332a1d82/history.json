While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, the simplification was too aggressive. Key vocabulary from the original, such as 'infrequent' and 'resistant', was replaced with much simpler A1/A2 level phrases like 'not very common' and 'stronger'. This resulted in a text that lacks the lexical complexity expected for a B1 learner. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, reintroduce slightly more advanced vocabulary. For example, 'it is not very common for them to fall down' could be revised to 'this kind of collapse does not happen often'.",

However, it failed the CEFR compliance check, with the classifier rating the output as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the retention of B2-level vocabulary, specifically the word 'collapse', which was identified as a candidate for replacement. Additionally, the final sentence, 'Engineers have learned how to build them in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement,' uses a complex structure with a relative clause that increases its difficulty. Suggestion: Replace 'collapse' with a simpler B1 phrase like 'fall down'. Consider splitting the final sentence to reduce its complexity, for example: 'Engineers build these bridges in special areas. These areas are more resistant to movement during an earthquake.'",
