    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The simplification of the final complex sentence into two shorter, clearer sentences ('Engineers have learned to build these bridges in special areas. These areas are more resistant to movement.') is an excellent example of a B1-level strategy. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'infrequent' with 'not common' and 'collapse' with 'fall down', are highly effective for the target audience. All metrics are well above the required thresholds, confirming the output's high fidelity and meaning preservation. The B1 classification is accurate.",
