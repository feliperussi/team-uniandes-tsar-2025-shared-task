    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The output successfully maintains factual integrity and meaning. The handling of keywords is a model of good practice; the parenthetical definitions for 'sharing economy' (where people share resources like cars or homes for a fee) and 'business model' (how a company plans to make money) are clear, concise, and perfectly integrated. The vocabulary strategy is excellent, effectively simplifying complex terms like 'lucrative' to the descriptive phrase 'that earns them good money'. Furthermore, the text's structure is improved for B1 readability by splitting longer, more complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones. This is a high-quality submission with no required changes.",
