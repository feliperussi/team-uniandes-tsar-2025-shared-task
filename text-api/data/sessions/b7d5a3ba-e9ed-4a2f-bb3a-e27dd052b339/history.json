        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. This failure occurred despite passing the critical Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks. The B2 classification is likely due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'A business model, which is a plan that shows how a company makes money, has risen rapidly in popularity; it uses an online platform that puts customers in contact with people who can provide a particular product or service' uses a non-defining clause and a semicolon, which is characteristic of B2-level writing. To correct this, the sentence should be split into two simpler sentences. For example: 'A business model is a plan that shows how a company makes money. One popular model uses an online platform to connect customers with service providers.' Additionally, retaining the B2-level word 'popularity' and the advanced adjective 'lucrative' contributed to the higher classification. Consider replacing 'lucrative accommodation' with a simpler phrase like 'accommodation that earns them good money'.",

        "feedback_text": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The output successfully maintains factual integrity and meaning. The handling of keywords is a model of good practice; the parenthetical definitions for 'sharing economy' (where people share resources like cars or homes for a fee) and 'business model' (how a company plans to make money) are clear, concise, and perfectly integrated. The vocabulary strategy is excellent, effectively simplifying complex terms like 'lucrative' to the descriptive phrase 'that earns them good money'. Furthermore, the text's structure is improved for B1 readability by splitting longer, more complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones. This is a high-quality submission with no required changes.",
