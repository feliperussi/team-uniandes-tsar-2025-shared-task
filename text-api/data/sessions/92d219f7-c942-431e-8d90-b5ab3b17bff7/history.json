        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required B1 level. This is likely due to the presence of more complex vocabulary and structures such as the phrase 'working toward finding' and the use of 'could be a serious danger if they come close to Earth's path'. To meet B1 requirements, simplify compound verb forms and rephrase complex conditional subordinate clauses. Using simpler conjunctions and shorter sentences would help achieve better compliance. The text is factually accurate with preserved meaning and high fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.84, BERTScore 0.95), but the linguistic level is too advanced for B1. Focus on reducing complexity in sentence construction and vocabulary to pass CEFR compliance.",
