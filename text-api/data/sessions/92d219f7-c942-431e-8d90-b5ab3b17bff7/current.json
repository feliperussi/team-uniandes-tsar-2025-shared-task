There are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but only around 8,000 have been found so far. This means that 17,000 still have not been recorded. We know that in 2013, a 19-metre asteroid exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia and injured 1,200 people. Because of this, these medium-sized asteroids are a serious danger if they get close to Earth.",
