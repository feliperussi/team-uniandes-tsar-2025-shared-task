    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6184 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text's central purpose is 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your version, 'She wanted to show that women and girls can be strong... She wanted to change this idea,' is a substantial semantic downgrade. It changes the concept from an active act of 'empowerment' to a passive act of 'showing'. The original's meaning of fighting against societal 'discouragement' is lost.\n\n- Structural and Vocabulary Compliance: The text adheres well to A2 vocabulary and sentence structure, and the CEFR classifier correctly identifies it as A2. However, this compliance is irrelevant due to the failure to preserve the source text's fundamental meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The final paragraph must be rewritten to restore the core concepts. The idea of 'empowerment' must be translated into simple A2 terms without losing its meaning. Rephrase to convey the idea of giving power or confidence to others. For example: 'She wanted to help women and girls in her country feel more powerful.' This more accurately reflects the original intent.",
