The MeaningBERT score of 0.6905 is below the required threshold of 0.75, indicating loss of core message.\n- The original term \"Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\" was replaced with \"maybe dangerous\", omitting the precise technical name.\n- The phrase \"two defence solutions\" became \"two ways to protect Earth\", losing the nuance of planned defence methods.\n- The text drops the concept of \"making predictions about possible impact\" before launching solutions, reducing fidelity.\nSuggestion: Use the exact term \"Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\" instead of paraphrasing.\nSuggestion: Retain \"defence solutions\" rather than generic \"ways to protect Earth\".\nSuggestion: Include \"make predictions about possible impact\" to fully preserve the original meaning.",
