This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The over-simplification into a list of disconnected facts destroyed the relationship between the DART test, its target, and its purpose.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.88 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key lexical information from the original, such as the full name 'Double Asteroid Redirection Test' and the specific 'Earth-based telescopes', was completely removed, not simplified. This results in a loss of fidelity.\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. For example, 'The first plan is called DART. DART is a test.' This is below the A2 standard and reads like an A1 text. This fragmentation is the primary cause of the meaning loss.\n- Loss of Nuance: The original text's concept of 'hopefully the impact... will knock it out' conveys the experimental goal. Your version, 'DART will hit Didymoon. This will move Didymoon', presents it as a simple future fact, losing the essential meaning that this is a test with an expected outcome.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to connect ideas within sentences. Use simple connectors like 'and' or 'so'. Combine the first two sentences. Rephrase to restore the idea that the DART mission is a test with a specific goal that scientists want to observe.",

The original states the impact will 'knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up'. This implies a measurable test of force and redirection.\n- Your version weakens this to 'move it from its orbit' and 'see if the orbit changes'. This phrasing is too general and loses the specific scientific purpose of the mission. The meaning is diluted from a precise test to a simple observation.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Restore the concept of a measurable test. Rephrase the final sentence. Instead of 'see if the orbit changes', use 'measure how much the orbit changes'.\n- Suggestion: Use stronger, more precise A2-level verbs. Replace 'move it from its orbit' with 'push it onto a new path'. This better reflects the 'redirection' in the DART acronym.",
