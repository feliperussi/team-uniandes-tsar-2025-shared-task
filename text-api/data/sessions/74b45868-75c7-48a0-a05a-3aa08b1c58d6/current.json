    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). This is when they fly less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology now to follow these rocks. It can know if they are going to hit Earth. If an asteroid is a danger, NASA has two plans to keep us safe.",
