        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6374 is below the required 0.75, indicating that the core message is not sufficiently preserved. The original text recommends a people-oriented management style with specific examples of flexibility, positive reinforcement, and professional development focused on social and intercultural communication. However, the rewritten text simplifies concepts excessively and omits crucial details like 'intercultural communication' and the emphasis on 'positive reinforcement and recognition,' reducing the message's depth and accuracy. Additionally, the BERTScore is 0.8406, which is under the 0.90 threshold, demonstrating significant loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing. Words like 'management' and 'development' are replaced or overly simplified, and some original instructions ('consider how we can enable employees to work from chosen locations') are vague in the rewrite. Although the CEFR classifier results in A2, the text contains several B1/B2 vocabulary words such as 'management,' 'development,' 'communication,' 'recognition,' and 'investment,' which are outside the A2 lexical range and thus inappropriate. The sentence structures are generally simple but suffer from oversimplification that harms precise meaning preservation. Suggestion: Restore critical details about the management style focused on 'people-oriented' approach, explicitly include 'intercultural communication,' and use simpler synonyms approved for A2 but still precise enough to maintain the original message. Remove or replace B1/B2 terms with compliant A2 vocabulary without losing factual content. Improve lexical fidelity to reach BERTScore \u2265 0.90 and meaning preservation to pass MeaningBERT threshold.",
