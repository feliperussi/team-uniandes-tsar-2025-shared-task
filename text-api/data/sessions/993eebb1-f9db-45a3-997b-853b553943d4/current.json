    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7973 and BERTScore of 0.9492 both exceed the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating successful targeting of the intended complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. The writer skillfully rephrased complex structures and vocabulary, such as changing 'have a word about your performance in the recent project' to 'talk about your work in the last project', and 'worry about it all weekend, wondering what you might have done wrong' to 'feel anxious about it all weekend, thinking what you could have done wrong'. The integration of the definition for the keyword 'feedback' ('it's a way of giving feedback \u2013 comments or advice about your work \u2013 where first, you say something nice, then you say what you truly want to say, and then you say something nice again') is particularly well-executed and significantly enhances clarity for a B1 audience. The flow of the text is natural, and B1-appropriate connectors are used effectively. One minor point for consideration: the word 'really' (an A1 candidate) was replaced with 'truly' (an A2 candidate). While 'truly' is still within the B1 range, retaining 'really' might have offered a slightly simpler lexical choice, aligning more closely with the goal of simplification where possible. However, this does not detract from the overall high quality of the output.",
