This shows a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original source.\n\n- Deviation: The text includes a writer's internal thought process. This is unacceptable.\n- Deviation: The simplification is too extreme, resulting in catastrophic metric scores for meaning and fidelity. The concept of accidents being \"extremely rare\" is reduced to \"do not happen often,\" which loses the original emphasis.\n- Deviation: The phrase \"avoid a bridge fall down\" is grammatically incorrect.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all notes and non-content text from the final output. The text must be clean. Suggestion: Re-write the text to be less simplistic. While using A2 vocabulary, you must retain the core concepts to meet the meaning and fidelity score requirements. Suggestion: Correct the grammatical structure. Use a phrase like \"stop a bridge from falling down\".",

The original text states that modern methods can 'help to reduce' accidents, but your output claims they can 'stop a bridge from collapsing'.

These words must be replaced with simple A2 descriptions.\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'Making work safer and using better designs can help reduce these accidents' uses gerunds ('Making', 'using') as the subject. This is a B1-level grammatical structure.\n- Typographical Error: The text contains a typo: 'a2 bridge'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentence to accurately reflect the meaning of 'reduce', not 'stop'. Replace all B1 and C1 vocabulary. The phrase 'detect structural weakness' must be simplified to A2 terms, such as 'find problems with the bridge'.
