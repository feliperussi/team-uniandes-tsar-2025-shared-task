    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6836 is below the required 0.75. The core message and nuances of the original text were not sufficiently preserved. Specific issues include: 1. The phrase 'more likely to give food' in the original implies a probability, which was simplified to 'give food... more', suggesting frequency instead. This alters the original meaning. 2. The original's 'even learnt' conveys a sense of surprise or advanced skill, which is lost in the simpler 'learn'. 3. The strong causal link in the original's final sentence, 'so used to... that they travel largely unnoticed', is weakened in the rewrite. The original emphasizes the direct consequence of familiarity leading to being unnoticed, while the rewrite separates these ideas, reducing the impact of the dogs being 'largely unnoticed' as a direct result. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the original's nuances of probability, surprising skill, and direct cause-and-effect relationships, ensuring the MeaningBERT score improves.",
