This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The writer's output oversimplifies key concepts, diluting the original meaning. For example: 1. The phrase 'They learn something' is excessively vague and fails to convey the specific learning point that 'humans are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs'. This removes the strategic element of the dogs' behavior. 2. The original concept of dogs being 'sent to beg for food' due to human preference is reduced to 'these small dogs go to ask for food', losing the nuance of a deliberate strategy within the pack. 3. The causal relationship 'metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals' is broken into two separate, less connected statements: 'people on the train are now used to seeing dogs. Locals often do not see them.' This diminishes the logical flow and the consequence of human familiarity.

Your text fails to fully capture the nuanced meaning of the original. The original text describes a strategic, learned behavior where packs send 'smaller, cuter dogs' to 'beg for food for the whole pack' because humans are 'more likely to give food' to them. Your version, 'So, the group sends these small dogs. They ask for food for all the group,' simplifies this to the point of losing the strategic element and the 'more likely' aspect of human behavior that drives the dogs' actions. This diminishes the core message of the pack's calculated exploitation of human empathy. Additionally, the phrase 'travel largely unnoticed by locals' in the original implies a state of being ignored due to familiarity, whereas your 'So, locals often do not see them' is a more literal and less nuanced interpretation, losing the subtle implication of indifference despite presence. Suggestion: Rephrase the first and last sentences to more accurately convey the strategic and nuanced meanings of the original text, ensuring the 'why' behind the dogs' actions and the 'how' of their unnoticed travel are preserved.",

This is an addition to the meaning.\n*   The original's 'Scientists are not sure how the dogs know' was simplified to 'Scientists do not know one thing: How do dogs know'. The addition of 'one thing' changes the nuance from general uncertainty to a specific, singular unknown, which is a subtle but significant shift in meaning.\n*   The original's 'One idea is that they use...' and 'Another possibility is that they have learnt...' use 'that' clauses to introduce ideas.

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuanced meaning. The text fails to convey the full scope of the original's information. \n\n*   The original text's specific detail that humans are 'more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs' is simplified to 'people like small, nice dogs. People give more food to these dogs.' The nuance of 'cuter' and the direct causal link for human preference is diminished. \n*   The complex causal structure 'metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals' is broken into disconnected sentences: 'People on the train see dogs very often now. They are used to seeing them. So, locals do not notice the dogs.' This simplification loses the direct cause-and-effect relationship and the specific meaning of 'largely unnoticed'. \n*   The original's use of 'recognise the scents' and 'recognise the names' implies a specific cognitive ability. The simplified 'learn to know the smells' and 'learn the names' is a weaker, less precise description of this ability, contributing to meaning loss. \n*   The overall simplification of complex sentences into very short, declarative sentences, while aiming for A2, has inadvertently fragmented the logical flow and the subtle connections between ideas present in the original, leading to a diminished overall meaning. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the causal relationships and specific details, even with simpler vocabulary. Ensure that the core reasons and consequences are clearly linked.",

Your text loses important nuances and the full impact of the original message. Specific issues include: The phrase 'more likely to give food' was simplified to 'often give food', which loses the comparative aspect of the original. The emphasis of 'even learnt' was lost by simplifying to 'learn', removing the sense of surprise or unexpected skill. 'Excellent sense of smell' was reduced to 'very good smell', diminishing the strength of the dogs' ability. 'Scents of their favourite destinations' was simplified to 'smells of their favourite places', losing the specific and slightly more refined connotation of 'scents' and the precise term 'destinations'. 'Another possibility' was changed to 'Another idea', which slightly alters the nature of the proposed explanation. The complex causal relationship in 'metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals' was not fully captured. Your version 'People on the metro see dogs often now. They are used to seeing them. So, locals do not often notice the dogs.' loses the strong degree of familiarity ('so used to') and the passive, almost invisible state ('largely unnoticed') of the dogs. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain the original nuances. For example, for 'more likely', consider 'people give food to small dogs more than to big dogs'. For 'even learnt', consider adding a phrase like 'it is surprising that they learn'. For the last sentence, focus on conveying the strong degree of familiarity and the resulting lack of attention.",

Your version states 'locals do not notice the dogs', which implies complete lack of notice, losing the nuance of 'largely'. The original text uses 'Another possibility is that they have learnt'. Your version uses 'Another idea is this: Maybe they learn', which introduces a stronger degree of uncertainty than the original's more neutral 'possibility'.

Your version explicitly adds 'It is surprising', which is an interpretation and not a direct factual statement from the original, altering the objective tone.

Avoid adding interpretive statements like 'It is surprising' unless explicitly part of the original meaning.

The strong causal link in the original's final sentence, 'so used to... that they travel largely unnoticed', is weakened in the rewrite.
