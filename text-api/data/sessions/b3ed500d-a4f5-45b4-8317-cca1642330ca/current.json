    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5964 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text explains a concept: how things that seem useless ('underutilised') are transformed into something useful ('asset') for others. Your version, 'things they do not use very much', fails to capture this critical idea of transformation.\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8868 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key original phrases like 'underutilised items' and 'facilitate peer-to-peer sharing' with overly simple words, losing lexical precision.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'value' was used. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Restore the core concept that one person's unused things can be important for another person. Remove the B1 word 'value' and replace it with an A2 phrase like 'can be useful for'. Do not simply state facts; connect them to explain the concept as the original did.",
