Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below. This is a critical error.\n- Lexical Deviation: The original text uses the term 'coverage'. Your replacement, 'signal', is not a direct equivalent and contributed to the fidelity score drop. The original term should have been retained or simplified using A2 vocabulary, such as 'no service'.\n- Phrasing Loss: The phrase 'just when you absolutely need to call' was simplified to 'At that important moment'. This change, while simplifying, loses the original's specific emphasis and contributed to the fidelity failure.\n\nSuggestion: Do not introduce vocabulary above the A2 level.
