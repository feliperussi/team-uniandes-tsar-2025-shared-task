    "feedback": "FAIL: Vocabulary Standard Violation. The text fails the qualitative audit due to the use of vocabulary above the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Detected: The text uses the word 'signal', which is classified as B1 level vocabulary. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. The word appears in 'The phone has no signal!' and 'You will have no signal.'\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'But just when you need to call, your phone will not work' uses a complex time clause ('just when...') that pushes the boundary of A2 and approaches B1 structure.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'signal' with a simpler A2 concept. Use phrases like 'your phone cannot connect' or 'there is no service'. Simplify the complex sentence. Rephrase to: 'You need to call at that moment. But your phone will not work.'",
