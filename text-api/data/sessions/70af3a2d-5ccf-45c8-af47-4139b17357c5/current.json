I can go to my children's school shows. Or I can make a time to see the dentist.\n\nBut there is a bad side. I do not have clear work hours. I often work late in the evening.

    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification, passing all diagnostic checks.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All key information from the original text is present and accurate. No discrepancies were found.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8182 and BERTScore of 0.9132 are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classifies as A2, meeting the target standard precisely.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. Simplifications such as 'global' to 'big', 'headquarters' to 'main office', and 'downside' to 'bad side' are perfect for the target level. The original text's complex sentences have been flawlessly broken down into short, simple sentences using appropriate A2-level connectors like 'So', 'But', and 'because'.",
