    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6447 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The primary failure is the omission of the concept 'employee engagement'. The original text is about investigating why employees are engaged (or not). Your version simplifies this to 'why workers stay or leave', which is a different and less nuanced concept. This change is the main reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8819 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to the replacement of key phrases like 'principal objective' and 'offer recommendations', which reduces lexical fidelity to the source.\n- The definitions for 'turnover' and 'retention' are acceptable for A2, but they do not compensate for the loss of meaning in the main body of the text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase the sentence 'We will study the reasons why workers stay or leave.' to something that captures the idea of engagement, such as 'We will study why our workers are happy or unhappy in their jobs.' Also, rephrase 'we will explain how to make the company a better place' to more closely match 'offer recommendations', for example: 'Then, we will give ideas to make the company better for workers.'",
