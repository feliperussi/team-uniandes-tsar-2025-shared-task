The output adds a great deal of new explanatory information (e.g., 'is a spacecraft mission', 'which orbits a larger body', 'which is a near-Earth asteroid') that was not present in the original text. While this information is factually correct, it dilutes the original's concise focus on the DART test itself, altering the semantic emphasis. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR Compliance check. The output was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. This is due to the repeated use of long, complex sentences with non-defining relative clauses, a grammatical structure more typical of the B2 level. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target and preserve meaning, avoid adding external information and focus on simplifying the existing text. Break down complex sentences into shorter, more direct statements. For example, 'Didymos, which is a near-Earth asteroid, has a main body...' could be simplified to 'Didymos is a near-Earth asteroid.

The output changes this to a more direct statement of cause and effect, losing this important nuance. Additionally, the change from the forceful 'knock it out of its orbit' to the softer 'move Didymoon out of its orbit' contributes to this shift in meaning. A secondary failure is in CEFR Compliance.

This is because the original text's strong phrasing 'knock it out of its orbit' was simplified to 'change Didymoon\u2019s orbit'. This change loses the core meaning of a forceful, deliberate redirection test. A better simplification would be 'push it into a different orbit'. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the complex sentence 'Didymoon is about 150 metres wide and circles Didymos, which is about 800 metres across.' Using a non-defining relative clause ('which is...') is a B2-level structure. To correct this, split the sentence into two: 'Didymoon is about 150 metres wide and circles Didymos.

The original text emphasizes that DART is a 'Redirection Test' with a specific goal of changing an orbit *enough* to be detected. The simplified output describes the event but loses this emphasis on the scientific test and its measurable outcome, which likely caused the score drop. Additionally, the output fails the CEFR Compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the final sentence: 'The impact should push Didymoon into a different orbit that Earth\u2011based telescopes can pick up.' The use of a relative clause ('that...') to modify 'orbit' creates a sentence structure that is more characteristic of the B2 level. To correct this, split the final sentence into two simpler ideas. For example: 'The impact should push Didymoon into a different orbit. Telescopes on Earth should be able to see this change.'",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The original text describes a test to see if a change is detectable ('hopefully the impact... will knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up'). Your output changes this to a more declarative statement of what is expected to happen ('The impact should push Didymoon into a different orbit'), losing the crucial nuance that this is an experiment with an uncertain outcome. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely caused by the sentence 'Didymoon is about 150 metres wide and circles Didymos, which is about 800 metres across.'
