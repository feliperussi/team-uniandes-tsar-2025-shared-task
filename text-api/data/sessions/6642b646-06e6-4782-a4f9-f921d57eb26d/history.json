The original text states that councils tried to encourage artists 'not to paint graffiti randomly on walls', meaning the goal was to control the location of the art. Your output simplifies this to 'not to paint graffiti', which incorrectly implies the goal was to stop the art form entirely. The loss of the concept 'randomly' is the primary reason for this failure. To correct this, you should rephrase to capture the original intent, for example: '...encourage artists not to paint graffiti on just any wall...'. While the vocabulary simplification was good (e.g., 'councils' to 'governments') and the keyword 'graffiti' was correctly defined, inserting the definition mid-sentence made the first sentence too long and complex for a B1 level. It would be better to place the definition in its own sentence.",

The model interprets this new information as a deviation from the original's core message. Despite this metric-based failure, the submission is factually accurate, has a high fidelity score (BERTScore 0.96), and correctly meets the B1 CEFR target. To pass, the simplification must preserve meaning more closely according to the metric, which may require avoiding the addition of new definitional sentences.",
