    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6358 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This failure is likely caused by the addition of the introductory sentence, 'Graffiti is pictures or writing on walls in public places.' While defining the keyword 'graffiti' is a good simplification strategy, adding a full sentence of new information that is not present in the original text significantly alters the semantic content from the perspective of the evaluation metric. The metric compares the output directly to the original, and this new information causes a divergence. To fix this, either remove the added definition or integrate it into an existing sentence to stay closer to the source text's structure.",
