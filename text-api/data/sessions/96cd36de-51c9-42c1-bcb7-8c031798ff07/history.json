Rephrase to 'Some news says the world is becoming more violent'.\n- Suggestion: Replace all non-A2 words. 'Terrorism' must be explained in simple terms.

This metric confirms a significant loss of key words from the original text, primarily the replacement of 'civilians' with the incorrect word 'people'.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'fighting' is classified as B1. It is not permitted at the A2 level. The phrase 'group fighting' is an unacceptable simplification for 'political conflict'.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. The sentence must read 'wars have killed more civilians than soldiers'. Replace the B1 word 'fighting' with an A2 alternative.

This simplification is too broad and loses lexical precision.\n- Deviation: The phrase 'co-existing more peacefully' was replaced with 'get along more'. The phrasal verb 'get along' is too informal and loses the specific meaning of 'peacefully'.\n- Deviation: The term 'political conflict' was simplified to 'war'. This is an oversimplification that loses the distinction from other types of wars mentioned in the text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore lexical fidelity while maintaining A2 simplicity. The term 'terrorism' can be explained simply, for example, 'attacks by terrorists'. The concept of 'co-existing peacefully' must be retained; rephrase to 'countries live together more peacefully'.

This is a severe alteration of the original fact and the primary reason for the low metric scores.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the words 'fighting' and 'charge'. These are B1-level words and are not compliant with the A2 standard. The sentence 'The fighting is between groups about who is in charge' is unacceptable.\n\n- Inaccurate Simplification: Your attempt to simplify 'political conflict' resulted in the use of prohibited B1 vocabulary. This is a failure to find an A2-compliant solution.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost comparison between civilian and soldier deaths. Remove the B1 words 'fighting' and 'charge'. Replace the sentence about 'political conflict' with a simpler A2 construction, such as 'They are less likely to be killed when groups fight for power.'",
