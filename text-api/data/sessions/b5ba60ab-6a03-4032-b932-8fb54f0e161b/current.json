    "feedback": "The output successfully maintains factual integrity, meaning, and fidelity to the original text, as evidenced by the high BERTScore (0.993) and MeaningBERT score (0.9416). The text is also correctly classified as B1 CEFR level, meeting the target requirement. However, the writer's output is almost identical to the original text. The changes made, such as replacing 'like' with 'such as' and 'But' with 'However', are minor stylistic adjustments and do not demonstrate a significant effort in text simplification. While the original text was already relatively simple and at a B1 level, the core purpose of this competition is to actively simplify. For future submissions, even when the source text is already accessible, consider rephrasing sentences, breaking down slightly longer clauses, or using simpler grammatical structures where appropriate, to clearly show the simplification process and add value beyond mere reproduction.",
