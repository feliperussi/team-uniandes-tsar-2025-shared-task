While the simplification maintained factual integrity and meaning, the vocabulary and grammatical structures were reduced beyond the B1 threshold. For example, 'common sight' was simplified to 'often seen', and the more nuanced 'considered a danger or a pest' was simplified to 'think they are dangerous or a problem'. The original phrasing 'world's press has been full of reports' was also simplified to 'the news has had many stories'. To achieve a B1 level, the text should aim for slightly more varied vocabulary and maintain some of the original's more nuanced expressions, while still simplifying complex grammar. Consider retaining some B1-level vocabulary from the original or introducing new B1 synonyms. For instance, 'common sight' could be retained or replaced with a B1 synonym like 'frequently observed'. The phrase 'considered a danger or a nuisance' could be rephrased to 'seen as a danger or a nuisance' to maintain a B1 vocabulary level.",

The text is also correctly classified as B1 CEFR level, meeting the target requirement. However, the writer's output is almost identical to the original text. The changes made, such as replacing 'like' with 'such as' and 'But' with 'However', are minor stylistic adjustments and do not demonstrate a significant effort in text simplification. While the original text was already relatively simple and at a B1 level, the core purpose of this competition is to actively simplify. For future submissions, even when the source text is already accessible, consider rephrasing sentences, breaking down slightly longer clauses, or using simpler grammatical structures where appropriate, to clearly show the simplification process and add value beyond mere reproduction.",
