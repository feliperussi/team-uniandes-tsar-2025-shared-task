This is a critical failure at a high priority level. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.731 is below the required 0.75. The nuance of the original text's comparative statement 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' is weakened by the output's separate statements 'usually just by chance' and 'not often a prophecy'. Additionally, 'we probably choose to forget' implies a degree of agency, which is lost in the simpler 'We probably forget'.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8942 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical and structural elements from the original text were not sufficiently preserved. For example, the phrase 'Dreams of a phone call from an old friend or the death of someone close, for example, are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' was significantly rephrased, losing specific terms like 'result of coincidence' and the comparative structure 'more likely... than'. The phrase 'all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen' was also broken down, losing some of its original phrasing.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the text to more accurately reflect the comparative meaning of 'more likely... than' without increasing complexity. For example, 'These dreams are more often by chance, not prophecy.'\n- Ensure that the concept of 'choosing to forget' is conveyed, even if simplified, to maintain the original's subtle meaning. For example, 'We often forget the dreams that do not come true.'\n- Review the output for closer lexical alignment with the original text's key phrases while maintaining A2 simplicity.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6453 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.8936 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: 1. Loss of Core Meaning: The original text states 'we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen.' The writer's output simplifies this to 'We often forget the dreams that do not come true.' This removes the crucial concept of 'choice' or active selection in forgetting, which is central to the original's meaning. 2. Lexical Fidelity Loss: The phrase 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' is simplified to 'more often by chance. They are not a prophecy.' This loses the comparative 'more likely' and the specific phrasing 'result of coincidence'. 3. Unwarranted Addition: The sentence 'A prophecy is when you know the future.' is an addition not present in the original text. While definitions can be helpful for A2, this specific content was not part of the original message and contributes to the deviation from fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to explicitly include the idea of 'choosing to forget' or 'deciding to forget' dreams that do not come true. Ensure that the comparison of 'more likely' is retained. Remove any content not present in the original text to maintain strict fidelity.",

The text fails to fully capture the nuanced meaning of the original. The original text emphasizes a comparison of likelihood ('more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy'), which is simplified to a direct statement ('Most times, these dreams happen by chance. They are not a prophecy.') in the rewrite, losing the comparative aspect. Additionally, the original's 'for example' and 'And, of course,' which add context and nuance, are omitted. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly convey the idea of likelihood and comparison. Ensure that the examples are clearly presented as illustrative rather than exhaustive. Consider how to simply integrate the nuance of 'of course'.",
