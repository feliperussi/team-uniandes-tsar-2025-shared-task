    "text_translated": "When Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl, she saw a foreign child in her home country of Bangladesh playing with a hula hoop, which is a plastic ring that you move around your body. She wanted to play too, but she just watched because in her country people believed that activities like this were not suitable for girls. Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world who has climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro, and she is the first person to use a hula hoop on each peak. She did this for a particular reason: she wanted to make women and girls stronger and more confident in a country which discourages them from doing sport.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6899 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the core message. The primary cause is likely the simplification of the word 'empower' to 'make stronger and more confident'. While this is a good attempt, 'empower' has a specific meaning of giving agency and power that was not fully captured. Additionally, the original text's phrase 'reluctantly stood by and watched' was simplified to 'she just watched', which removed the important emotional nuance of her hesitation. To improve, consider a B1-level phrase that is closer to 'empower', such as 'to give women and girls more control over their lives'.",
