Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, reintroduce slightly more advanced but still accessible vocabulary.

The original text uses the strong verb 'empower' to describe the goal, which implies giving power to women to overcome societal barriers. The simplification to 'encourage' softens this message to one of giving confidence. Similarly, changing 'discourages' to 'does not support' reduces the sense of active opposition present in the original. This change in nuance, from a story about fighting against discouragement to one about providing encouragement, is the likely reason for the low score. Suggestion: To better preserve the meaning, consider a phrase like 'to help women and girls become stronger' or 'to give women more power' instead of just 'encourage'. On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, meets the B1 CEFR target, and correctly defines the keyword 'hula hoop'.",
