Your text incorrectly states 'All companies around the world use English to talk', which is a false absolute statement. This is an instant failure.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: This factual error is confirmed by the metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5672 is catastrophically below the required 0.75, indicating a severe loss of the original meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.884 is below the 0.90 threshold, showing a failure to retain key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B2-level word 'means'. This is not A2 vocabulary.\n\n- Suggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. Rephrase to reflect the original's qualified statement, for example: 'Many companies use English to talk'. Replace 'Business etiquette means the rules for work' with 'Business etiquette is the rules for work'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6069 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8529 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text specifies consequences like 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies this to 'people think you are bad' and 'cause problems when people talk'. This is an unacceptable oversimplification that loses the specific meaning of cultural misunderstanding.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: Key phrases from the original, such as 'cultural norms and practices' and 'nuances and expectations', were completely removed. These are central to the text's meaning. Replacing them with generic phrases like 'the rules' and 'the way people do things' caused the fidelity score to drop below the minimum.\n\n- Excessive Simplification: The text has been broken down into short, disconnected sentences that destroy the logical flow. The core concept of 'culture' is entirely absent from your output, despite being the central theme of the original text.\n\nSuggestion: You must reintroduce the concept of 'culture'. Rephrase to restore the specific meaning of 'misunderstanding', not just 'problems'. Combine some of the choppy sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to create a more coherent text. The goal is simplification, not elimination of meaning.",

The text has lost too much lexical detail from the original source.\n\nSecondary Failure: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is an instant failure. The A2 standard was not met due to vocabulary and structural complexity.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases from the original text such as 'global business community' and 'nuances and expectations' were removed, causing the low BERTScore.\n- B1/B2 Vocabulary: The text uses words above the A2 level. 'judge' (B1), 'communication' (B1), 'cultural' (B1), and 'means' (B2) are not permitted.\n- B1 Structure: The sentence 'Business is done across international borders' uses the passive voice ('is done'), a structure that is too complex for the A2 level.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Replace the word 'judge'. Use 'think bad things about people'.\n- Suggestion: Replace 'communication breakdowns'. Use 'problems when people talk'.\n- Suggestion: Replace 'cultural norms'. Use 'a country's rules'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of 'business etiquette'. Do not use the B2 word 'means'. Use 'Business etiquette is the rules for work'.\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the passive sentence 'Business is done...' into an active sentence. Use 'People do business...'.\n- Suggestion: Restore more specific keywords from the original text to meet the 0.90 BERTScore requirement.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text explains that a lack of cultural understanding leads to specific negative consequences: 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication'. Your version reduces this to the vague and simplistic phrases 'you may think badly' and 'have problems when people talk'. This completely fails to capture the severity and nature of the consequences, which is the central point of the original paragraph.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8487 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing specific, meaningful phrases from the original with overly simple words, losing lexical fidelity.\n\n- Structural Failure: The output is a list of disconnected, choppy, and repetitive sentences. For example, 'They often use English to talk' is immediately followed by the redundant 'The global business community often uses English'. This disjointed structure prevents the text from conveying the logical relationship between ideas (cause and effect) present in the original.\n\n- Vocabulary Failure: The B1-level word 'global' was used. This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to restore the original meaning. Combine sentences to show cause and effect. Replace 'think badly' with a phrase that captures the concepts of 'unfair judgements' and 'misunderstandings'. Remove the B1 word 'global'. Eliminate all redundant sentences.",
