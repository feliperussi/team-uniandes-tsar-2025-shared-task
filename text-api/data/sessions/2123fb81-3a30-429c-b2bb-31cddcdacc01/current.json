    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks, demonstrating perfect adherence to the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All key information from the original text is present and accurate. The core narrative is fully preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The CEFR_Classifier_Result is A2, and a manual audit confirms this. The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1/A2 levels. Words like 'control', 'focus', 'ideal', and 'environment' are appropriate for the A2 level.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text correctly breaks down complex sentences from the original into short, simple sentences. For example, the original sentence 'So I started to go to a nearby caf\u00e9 to work, but the Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal and I found myself drinking too much coffee' was correctly simplified into three separate sentences. This is a model execution of A2 structural requirements.\n- Metrics: Both MeaningBERT (0.8851) and BERTScore (0.9022) are above the required thresholds, confirming that meaning and key terms were preserved during simplification.",
