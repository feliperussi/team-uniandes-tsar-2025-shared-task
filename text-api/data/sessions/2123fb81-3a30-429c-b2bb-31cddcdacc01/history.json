        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level. The text passed all automated metric checks, but a deep qualitative audit reveals a critical failure in vocabulary control. The output contains multiple words that are above the A2 level, making it non-compliant.\n\n- Deviation: The word 'concentrate' is B1 level. It was used in the sentence: 'I found it hard to concentrate.'\n- Deviation: The word 'housework' is B1 level. It was used in the sentence: 'Housework needed doing.'\n- Deviation: The word 'nearby' is B1 level. It was used in the sentence: 'So I went to a nearby cafe to work.'\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'concentrate' with the A2 word 'focus'. The sentence must be: 'I found it hard to focus.'\nSuggestion: Rephrase 'Housework needed doing.' to use A1/A2 words. Example: 'I needed to clean the house.'\nSuggestion: Rephrase 'nearby cafe' to use A1/A2 words. Example: 'a cafe near my house.'\n\nThe structural simplification into short sentences is correct, but vocabulary must be strictly controlled at the A2 level.",

The core narrative is fully preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The CEFR_Classifier_Result is A2, and a manual audit confirms this. The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1/A2 levels. Words like 'control', 'focus', 'ideal', and 'environment' are appropriate for the A2 level.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text correctly breaks down complex sentences from the original into short, simple sentences. For example, the original sentence 'So I started to go to a nearby caf\u00e9 to work, but the Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal and I found myself drinking too much coffee' was correctly simplified into three separate sentences. This is a model execution of A2 structural requirements.\n- Metrics: Both MeaningBERT (0.8851) and BERTScore (0.9022) are above the required thresholds, confirming that meaning and key terms were preserved during simplification.",
