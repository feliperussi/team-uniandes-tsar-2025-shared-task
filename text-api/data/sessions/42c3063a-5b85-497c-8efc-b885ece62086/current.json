However, charity shops cannot sell all the clothes that people do not want. 'Fast fashion', which means cheap clothes that go out of style very quickly, is often too poor quality to recycle. Because of this, people do not want to buy these clothes second-hand. So, huge amounts of clothes finally go into the rubbish. Also, many clothes that charity shops cannot sell are sent to other countries, and this creates even more money and nature problems.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7782 and BERTScore of 0.9353 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex sentence structures by splitting longer sentences and using B1-level connectors such as 'However', 'Because of this', 'So', and 'Also', which enhance readability and flow. The keyword 'Fast fashion' was accurately and clearly defined in-line, which is an excellent strategy for B1 learners. Vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate simplifications like 'disposable clothing problem' to 'problem with clothes' and 'economic and environmental problems' to 'money and nature problems'. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification that meets all requirements.",
