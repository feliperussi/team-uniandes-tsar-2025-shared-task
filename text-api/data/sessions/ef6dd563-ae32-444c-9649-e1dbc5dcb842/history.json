The primary reason for this classification is the complexity of the sentence structures, particularly the final sentence. The sentence 'However, when we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active, while the part that controls emotions becomes more active' is too complex for B1. It uses a sophisticated 'while' clause to connect two long, abstract clauses, each containing a relative clause ('that controls language/emotions'). This structure, along with the overall length and coordination of ideas, pushes the text beyond the B1 threshold. To achieve B1, this sentence should be split into shorter, simpler sentences. For example: 'However, when we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active. At the same time, the part that controls emotions becomes more active.'

Changing 'appear in our minds' to 'come', which simplifies the verb and phrase to an A1/A2 level. 3.

While the output successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT 0.9452, BERTScore 0.9688), the simplification strategy resulted in a text that is too simple for the target B1 audience. Specific examples of oversimplification include: 1. Sentence Splitting: The original sentence 'Maybe dreams are the result of our mind organising the thoughts we have during the day, but they appear in dreams with symbolic meaning' was split into two shorter sentences: 'Perhaps dreams are the result of our mind organizing the thoughts we have during the day. But these thoughts appear in dreams with special meaning.' This reduces grammatical complexity. 2. Noun Phrase Simplification: The phrase 'the part of our brain that controls language' was simplified to 'the language part of our brain', and 'the part that controls emotions' to 'the emotion part of our brain'. This makes the noun phrases less complex. 3. Vocabulary Choice: The word 'symbolic' (B2) was replaced with 'special' (A2/B1), which is a simplification that contributes to the lower CEFR level. To achieve a B1 level, consider retaining some of the original sentence structures, such as combining clauses with appropriate B1 connectors (e.g., 'while', 'although', 'however') or using slightly more complex noun phrases. Ensure that vocabulary choices align with the B1 level without oversimplifying key concepts.",

While the vocabulary used is generally appropriate for B1, the sentence structure, particularly in the final sentence, is too complex. The sentence 'But when we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active, while the part that controls emotions becomes more active' features a long, parallel clause structure connected by 'while', which is more typical of B2 writing. To simplify for a B1 audience, consider splitting this sentence into two shorter sentences or rephrasing the 'while' clause to be less parallel and perhaps shorter. For example: 'But when we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active. At the same time, the part that controls emotions becomes more active.' The factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.9452), and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.9809) were all excellent, but the CEFR level is a critical requirement.",

Similarly, 'Perhaps dreams are the result of our mind organizing the thoughts we have during the day, but these thoughts appear in dreams with hidden meaning' also features a complex structure with a relative clause and a coordinating conjunction connecting two clauses. To achieve a B1 level, these sentences should be broken down into shorter, simpler sentences. For instance, 'When we are awake, our thoughts usually appear in our minds as words.
