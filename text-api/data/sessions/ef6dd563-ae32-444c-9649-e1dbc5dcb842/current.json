    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, the sentence structures remain too advanced. For example, the sentence 'When we are awake, our thoughts usually appear in our minds as words, which are like conversations we have with ourselves' combines a temporal clause ('When we are awake') with a relative clause ('which are like conversations we have with ourselves') in a single, long sentence. Similarly, 'Perhaps dreams are the result of our mind organizing the thoughts we have during the day, but these thoughts appear in dreams with hidden meaning' also features a complex structure with a relative clause and a coordinating conjunction connecting two clauses. To achieve a B1 level, these sentences should be broken down into shorter, simpler sentences. For instance, 'When we are awake, our thoughts usually appear in our minds as words. These are like conversations we have with ourselves.' This would reduce the cognitive load and make the text more accessible for B1 learners.",
