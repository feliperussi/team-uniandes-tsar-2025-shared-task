        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7011 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to preserve the core scientific context of the original message.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text identifies methane as one of the 'most basic organic molecules' and a 'key ingredient' of natural gas. Your version, 'Methane is a type of gas. It is an important part of natural gas,' loses this critical scientific classification and reduces the significance of the discovery.\n- Secondary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. The sentence 'It is like the planet takes air in and out' uses a comparative structure ('like' + clause) that is characteristic of a B1 level. This structure is too complex for A2.\n- Factual Simplification Error: The original states Mars 'emits thousands of tons' of methane. Your simplification to 'makes a lot' loses the specific sense of scale, contributing to the meaning loss.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. The concept of 'organic molecule' must be simplified, not deleted. The final sentence must be broken down to avoid the B1-level comparison. Example: 'This change is like breathing.' or 'The planet seems to breathe the gas.'",
