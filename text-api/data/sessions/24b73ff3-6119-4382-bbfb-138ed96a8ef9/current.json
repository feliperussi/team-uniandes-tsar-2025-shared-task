    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is too complex for the A2 standard. The primary goal was not met.\n- The sentence 'It is like the planet takes air in and pushes air out' is the main reason for the B1 classification. Using a simile ('like') to explain an abstract, metaphorical idea is a B1-level language function. A2 text must be more direct and concrete.\n- The use of multiple phrasal verbs such as 'puts out', 'takes in', and 'pushes out' also contributes to the complexity, moving the text beyond a simple A2 level.\n- Suggestion: Remove the metaphorical final sentence. Replace it with a direct statement. For example: 'This change happens again and again with the seasons.'\n- Suggestion: Replace the phrasal verb 'puts out' with a simpler A2 verb. For example: 'Mars makes thousands of tons of methane.'",
