The MeaningBERT score of 0.743 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.887 is below the required 0.90. This indicates an unacceptable loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\n- Meaning and Fidelity Failure: The simplification process was too aggressive. Replacing nuanced phrases like 'isolated' and 'solitude' with the single word 'alone' and removing the concept of 'risk' has damaged the fidelity to the source text, causing the low metric scores.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, which is an instant failure. The text is too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'The more we are connected, the more we feel alone' uses a comparative correlative ('the more... the more...'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not permitted at the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'Those messages can be edited' uses a passive voice structure. While simple passives can appear at A2, this contributes to the overall complexity. An active sentence is required.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Break the complex comparative sentence into two simple sentences. For example: 'We are more connected with technology. But this makes us feel more alone.' Rephrase the passive sentence into an active one, for example: 'People can edit those messages.'",

While A2 requires simplicity, this level of fragmentation is more typical of A1 and fails to demonstrate A2-level sentence construction using basic connectors.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. The sentence must be rewritten to convey the idea of 'not experiencing time by oneself'. Suggestion: Simplify the text's conceptual load to achieve an A2 classification.

This indicates an excessive loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, resulting in a version that is lexically too distant from the source.\n\nFurther analysis reveals multiple compliance violations:\n\n- CEFR Classification Error: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a critical failure.\n\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The sentence 'They learn to talk with messages that they can edit' uses a defining relative clause ('that they can edit'). This is a B1-level structure and is too complex for A2.\n\n- Advanced Vocabulary: The word 'solitude' was retained from the original text. This is a B2/C1-level word and is completely inappropriate for an A2 audience. It must be replaced with a simpler concept.\n\n- Abstract Word Usage: The phrase 'enjoy their own company' uses 'company' in an abstract B1 sense. The A2 meaning relates to a business or being with other people, not being with oneself.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Replace the word 'solitude' with a simple A2 phrase like 'the feeling of being by yourself'. Split the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two simple sentences. Example: 'They learn to talk with messages. They can edit these messages.' Rephrase 'enjoy their own company' to 'be happy when they are alone'.",

The original's concept of 'learning how to enjoy their own company' was reduced to 'may not be happy when they are alone'. This changes the meaning from a failure to learn a skill to a simple emotional state, which is a critical distortion.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8774 is below the 0.90 minimum.

This gerund form is a B2-level structure and is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\n- Structural Failure: The output is a series of short, disconnected A1-level sentences. This choppy structure fails to convey the logical connections present in the original text and contributes to the low meaning preservation score.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be completely rewritten. Restore the original meaning regarding the skill of enjoying one's own company. Remove the B2-level word 'being' immediately. Replace 'the feeling of being by yourself' with a simple A2 alternative like 'what it is like to be alone'. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to combine choppy sentences and improve logical flow.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6546 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates the simplified text does not convey the same meaning as the original.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text conveys a strong, personal warning ('I honestly believe', 'danger', 'at the expense of'). Your version is a list of flat, declarative statements that removes this critical tone. The meaning is not just the facts, but the warning behind them. You have failed to preserve this.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8785 is below the minimum 0.90. This confirms that too much of the original's specific phrasing and lexical detail was lost during simplification.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'rarely', which is a B1 level adverb. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. This over-simplification is the direct cause of the meaning loss. For example, 'They can edit these messages. So they do not learn real conversation' fails to capture the stronger, negative consequence implied by the original phrase 'at the expense of learning the art of real conversation'.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text. Restore the original's sense of warning. Combine some of the short sentences using A2 connectors like 'and' or 'because' to show how the ideas are related. Remove the B1 word 'rarely' and replace it with an A2 phrase such as 'do not often'.",
