    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8872 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the general meaning was preserved.\n\n- The text oversimplifies key concepts, losing important lexical detail required for an accurate A2 summary.\n- The phrase 'lucrative accommodation' was reduced to 'a place to stay'. This loses the critical concepts of profitability and the type of service.\n- The term 'underutilised resources' was reduced to 'things they own but do not always use'. This is too general and loses the specific business concept.\n- The concept of a company acting as a 'middleman' was lost when rephrased as 'works between two groups of people'.\n- The phrase 'caught on to the profitability' was simplified to 'know this is a good way to make money', losing the specific meaning of 'profitability'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to restore the lost concepts using simple A2 vocabulary. Do not remove essential details. For example, instead of 'a place to stay', specify 'a room or house to stay in'. Retain the idea that this is a way to make 'a lot of money', not just 'extra money'.",
