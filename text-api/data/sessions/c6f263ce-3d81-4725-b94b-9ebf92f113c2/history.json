This indicates that while the general meaning was preserved, too much specific vocabulary and phrasing from the original text was lost during the simplification process.\n\n- Lexical Loss: The simplification of key terms was too aggressive, causing the fidelity score to drop. The phrase 'lucrative accommodation' was reduced to 'pay to stay in them', completely removing the concept of 'accommodation'. The term 'underutilised resources' became 'things that people do not use all the time', which is overly general and loses precision.\n- Meaning Preservation (Marginal Pass): The MeaningBERT score of 0.7633 is barely above the 0.75 minimum. This confirms that the core message is at risk due to the excessive simplification.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key A2-level concepts to improve fidelity. Rephrase the sentence about Airbnb to include the word 'accommodation' or a simple equivalent like 'a place to stay'. The goal is to simplify, not to eliminate core nouns. Revise to: 'Other people can pay for this accommodation.' This maintains A2 compliance while improving the BERTScore.",
