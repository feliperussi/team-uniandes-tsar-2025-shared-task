    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. This is likely because the simplification resulted in overly simple sentence structures and vocabulary. For example, the relative clause 'the part of our brain that controls language' was simplified to the prepositional phrase 'the part of our brain for language'. While grammatically correct, this simplification, combined with the use of predominantly A1/A2 vocabulary, lowered the overall complexity of the text. To elevate the text to B1, consider reintroducing slightly more complex structures without sacrificing clarity. For instance, keeping the original relative clause ('that controls language') would add necessary complexity. On a positive note, the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with excellent BERTScore (0.96) and MeaningBERT (0.89) scores, indicating the core message was kept intact.",
