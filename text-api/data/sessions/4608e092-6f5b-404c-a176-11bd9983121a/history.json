The original states '...we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen,' which is a statement about probability and memory bias. The output incorrectly changes this to '...they never actually happen.' This transforms a nuanced point about frequency into an incorrect absolute statement, which is a critical failure in preserving the original's factual basis.",

The MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy was exemplary; replacing 'coincidence' with 'chance' and 'prophecy' with 'prediction' are ideal simplifications for the B1 level. The sentence structure is also strong, effectively using 'Although' to create a complex sentence that is appropriate for the target audience.",
