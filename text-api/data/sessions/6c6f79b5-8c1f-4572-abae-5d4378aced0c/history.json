This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The primary failure is the translation of 'collapses under its own weight'. Your version, 'falls down because it is too heavy', is not equivalent. The original specifies that the bridge's own mass is the cause of the failure, a key engineering concept. Your version is too general and loses this precision.\n- The simplification of 'a miscalculation' to 'their math is wrong' is an oversimplification that contributes to the meaning drift.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning with A2 vocabulary. Rephrase 'collapses under its own weight' to 'the bridge is not strong enough for its own weight and it breaks'. Rephrase 'a miscalculation' to 'they made a mistake in their numbers'.",

The text demonstrates a model use of A2-level language.\n- Vocabulary: Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. No B1 or higher-level words were used.\n- Structure: Sentence structure is exemplary for A2. The original text's complex ideas, such as 'collapses under its own weight' and 'can be deadly', were correctly simplified into shorter, more direct sentences like 'it breaks' and 'They can die'.\n\nNo deviations from the A2 standard were detected. The output is a model example of simplification.",
