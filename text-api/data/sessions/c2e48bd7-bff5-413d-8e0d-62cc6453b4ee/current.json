    "text_translated": "Springsteen is different from many other artists who sell lots of albums. He is in his late 60s, but he still makes very popular new music. He plays in big stadiums and is still one of the best. This is not a surprise to me. He tells the most important stories about people's lives. When you listen to his album *Born in the USA*, you see that those stories are still important today.",
