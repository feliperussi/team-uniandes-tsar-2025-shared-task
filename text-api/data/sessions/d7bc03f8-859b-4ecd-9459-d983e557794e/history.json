While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning, the sentence structures are too complex for the target level. The first sentence, 'NASA is now working to find and record smaller asteroids, which are large rocks that travel in space, that are 140 metres wide or more,' uses an embedded relative clause which is a B2-level structure. Additionally, starting a sentence with 'Although' and using long, multi-clause sentences like the one describing the Chelyabinsk event are characteristic of a B2 text. To fix this, split complex sentences. For example, define 'asteroids' in a separate sentence and break the long sentence about the 2013 event into two or three shorter ones.",
