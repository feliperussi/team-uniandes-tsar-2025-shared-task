The text was incorrectly classified as B1, which is too complex for the A2 standard. The sentence 'They build them on ground that is strong against movement' uses a relative clause ('that is strong'). This is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key A2 vocabulary like 'earthquake'. The phrase 'a big shake of the ground' is too simplistic and damages fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Split the final complex sentence into two simple A2 sentences.
