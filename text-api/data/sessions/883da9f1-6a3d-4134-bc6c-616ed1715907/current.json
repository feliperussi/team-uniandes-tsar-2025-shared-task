    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The submission successfully meets the MeaningBERT (0.93) and BERTScore (0.91) thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details are preserved. The B1 classification is accurate. The handling of keywords is a key strength; both 'growth mindset' and 'plasticity' are introduced and then immediately defined in simple, clear language. The vocabulary strategy is also very effective, replacing complex terms like 'honing' and 'experimentation' with accessible B1 alternatives such as 'improve' and 'trying new ways'. The use of short, direct sentences makes the text highly readable for the target audience.",
