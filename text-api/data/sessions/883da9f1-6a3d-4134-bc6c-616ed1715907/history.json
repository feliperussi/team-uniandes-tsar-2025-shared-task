For example, the first sentence, 'Carol Dweck, a psychologist, supports the idea of a growth mindset \u2013 the belief that people can improve their abilities through practice,' uses an appositive ('a psychologist') and a dash to combine multiple ideas into one sentence, which is a B2-level construction. The final sentence is also long and contains a complex list of abstract nouns. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, break down these complex sentences. The first sentence could be split into two: 'Carol Dweck is a psychologist who supports the idea of a growth mindset.

For example, the sentence 'She also talks about the plasticity of the brain, which shows that the brain can change and grow' uses a non-defining relative clause ('which shows...'), a grammatical feature more typical of a B2 level. Additionally, the sentence 'Research shows that when we praise effort, experimentation and problem solving, we encourage the development of new skills' combines a subordinate clause with a list of abstract nouns, increasing its complexity. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, simplify these structures by splitting them into shorter sentences. For instance: 'She also talks about the plasticity of the brain. This means the brain can change and grow.' On a positive note, the submission was factually accurate and successfully preserved the original meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.94, BERTScore: 0.92).",
