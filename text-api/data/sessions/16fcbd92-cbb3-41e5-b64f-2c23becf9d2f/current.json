    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is too complex for the A2 standard. The core failure is the use of vocabulary above the required level.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words that are above the A2 level. This is the primary reason for the B1 classification.\n\nSpecific B1/B2 words used: 'potential', 'educate', 'conservation', 'inspire', 'treat'. These words must be replaced with simpler A2 alternatives.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'potential to educate' with 'can teach'.\nSuggestion: Replace 'conservation issues' with 'problems with saving animals'.\nSuggestion: Replace 'inspire people to protect' with 'make people want to protect'.\nSuggestion: Replace 'how to treat sick animals' with 'how to help sick animals'.",
