Your version presents these as separate, unrelated activities, which fundamentally changes the meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8883 shows a loss of key lexical items. Important concepts like 'conservation issues', 'safe environment', and 'important research' were oversimplified to the point of losing their meaning.\n\n- Structural Disconnection: The sentence pair 'Zoos give a safe home to animals. People hurt these animals in circuses.' is grammatically correct but semantically broken. It fails to convey the original meaning that zoos provide a home *for* animals mistreated in circuses. The connection is lost.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the logical links from the original text. Use simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to connect ideas.

The original text describes the 'potential to educate' and the goal to 'inspire people'. Your version flattens this nuanced concept into a direct, unsubstantiated claim: 'Zoos teach people'.

The abstract concept of 'conservation issues' is reduced to 'keep nature safe', which is an unacceptable oversimplification.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8799 is below the 0.90 minimum. This failure is a direct result of excessive word replacement. Key terms that define the original text's message, such as 'potential', 'educate', 'conservation', 'inspire', 'habitats', and 'research', have been completely removed. This has resulted in a critical loss of lexical fidelity.\n\n- Consequence: While the output uses A2 vocabulary and sentence structures, it has been simplified to the point of misrepresentation. The core message is lost.\n\n- Suggestion: Revise immediately. You must find A2-compliant ways to express the original concepts, not erase them.

This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n- Structural Failure: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. The relationship between animals being hurt in circuses and zoos providing them a home is lost because the sentences are separate.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Combine sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to show how ideas are linked. Replace the word 'inspire' with an A2 phrase like 'make people want to'. For example: 'Zoos can help people learn about problems for animals, and they can make people want to protect animal homes.'",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.594 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8782 is also below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text explains that zoos educate and inspire people, leading to conservation. Your output breaks this into a disconnected list of facts. The core concept of 'inspiring people to protect' is lost. The text has been over-simplified to the point of losing its central argument.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The low score is a direct result of removing key factual terms from the original text. Words and concepts like 'conservation issues', 'habitats', and 'important research' were eliminated, which damages the fidelity of the information presented.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: While the individual sentences are simple, their repetitive structure ('Zoos can...', 'Zoos give...', 'Zoos study...') makes the text robotic and unnatural. The logical flow of the original paragraph is completely absent.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the text to preserve the original meaning. Combine sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to show the relationship between ideas. For example, 'Zoos teach people about problems for animals and their homes, so people want to protect them.' This restores the cause-and-effect relationship from the original text. You must find A2-level ways to express concepts like 'conservation' and 'research' without simply deleting them.",

The text fails to preserve the core message of the original. The BERTScore of 0.8936 is also below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a critical loss of key vocabulary.\n\n- The original text states zoos have the 'potential to educate' and 'inspire people'. Your version changes this to a direct statement of fact: 'They help people learn... So people want to protect them.' This alters the meaning from a possibility to a certainty, which is a factual deviation.\n- The replacement of 'conservation issues' with 'problems for animals and their homes' is an oversimplification that contributes to the meaning loss.\n- The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing too many key terms from the original, such as 'habitats', 'mistreated', 'abandoned', and 'research'. While simplification is required, it must not come at the cost of fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to restore the original meaning. The concept of 'potential' or 'inspiration' must be included. Rephrase to more accurately reflect 'conservation issues' while remaining at an A2 level.
