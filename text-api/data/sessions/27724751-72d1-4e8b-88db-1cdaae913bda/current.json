    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.89 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text. The text also fails the primary CEFR compliance check.\n\n- CEFR Classification Error: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n- B1/B2 Vocabulary Violation: The B1 classification was caused by your failure to simplify B1 and B2 level vocabulary. You used the words 'species', 'release', and 'council' directly from the source text. These words are too advanced for the A2 level.\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore was caused by replacing multiple key terms. For example, 'employed' became 'hired' and 'policy' became 'plan'. While simplification is necessary, the cumulative effect of these changes reduced the text's fidelity to the original.\n\nSuggestion: Replace all words above the A2 level. Replace 'species' with 'type of animal'. Replace 'release' with 'let go'. Replace 'council' with 'city leaders'. This will correct the CEFR level and improve fidelity.",
