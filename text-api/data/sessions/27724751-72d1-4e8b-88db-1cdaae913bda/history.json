The concept of 'minimise conflicts between humans and baboons' was completely omitted. Your text only states the city wants to 'help them', which is too vague. The original text states the city council 'employed' the monitors; your version loses this specific action. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check. The classifier correctly rated this text as B1, not A2. You used B1-level vocabulary directly from the source text without simplification. The words 'species', 'release', and 'policy' are not A2 words. The verb 'electrocuts' is too complex for the A2 level. Suggestion: Restore the lost information about minimizing conflicts. Replace all B1 vocabulary with A2 alternatives. For example, instead of 'endangered species', use 'a type of animal that may disappear soon'. Instead of 'release', use 'let them go'. Instead of 'policy', use 'plan' or 'idea'. Rephrase the sentence using 'electrocuts' with simpler language, such as 'get a bad shock from wires'.",

This is a critical failure in preserving the lexical content of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The score indicates that key words and phrasing from the source text were lost during simplification. This is a direct violation of the fidelity requirement.\n- Evidence: The phrase 'endangered species' was replaced with 'There are not many baboons left.' While the meaning is similar, the loss of the specific terminology caused the fidelity score to drop. Similarly, 'electrocuted' was replaced with 'killed by electric wires'.\n- Structural Analysis: The sentence structure and vocabulary are otherwise compliant with the A2 standard. The text is factually correct and the MeaningBERT score is acceptable.\n- Corrective Action: You must retain more of the original text's specific vocabulary. The simplification was too aggressive, sacrificing required fidelity for readability. Revise the text to increase lexical overlap with the original while maintaining A2 sentence structure.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The submission fails on two critical metrics. First, the MeaningBERT score of 0.7272 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the core message. The original text explicitly links the hiring of monitors to the goals of saving baboons and minimizing conflict. Your version presents these as separate, disconnected facts, losing the essential cause-and-effect relationship. Second, the BERTScore of 0.8854 is below the required 0.90. This fidelity failure is caused by over-simplification of key factual terms like 'endangered species' and 'city council'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the chosen phrases are too distant from the source, resulting in a significant loss of lexical detail. The attempt to simplify was too aggressive and sacrificed meaning preservation. Suggestion: Restore the causal link. Combine the sentences to state WHY the monitors were hired. For example: 'To help the baboons and stop problems, people who run the town hired Baboon Monitors.' Suggestion: Revise the text to retain more key vocabulary from the original while simplifying the sentence structure.",
