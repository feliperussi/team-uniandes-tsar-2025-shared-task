For example, there have been bears in parks in Vancouver, leopards on the streets of Mumbai, and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Are they welcome, or do people think they are a danger or a problem?",

        "feedback_text": "The text does not meet the B1 standard. The primary issue is the vocabulary, which is limited to the A1 and A2 levels. A B1 writer is expected to use a core B1 vocabulary. For instance, the text avoids B1-level words from the original source like 'reports' and 'considered', opting for simpler A2 alternatives. Furthermore, the sentence structure is too simplistic for the B1 level, consisting mainly of short, declarative sentences. While the text is connected, it lacks the complexity expected, such as using subordinate clauses with connectors like 'which' or 'although' to create more fluid and detailed sentences. Finally, by omitting the specific examples of bears, leopards, and wild pigs, the summary loses critical information and fails to accurately represent the source text."

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates the ability to write simple, connected text on a familiar topic. The structure is very clear, using connectors like 'However' and 'For example' to create a logical and coherent flow between ideas. The sentence construction is also strong, effectively mixing simple sentences with a more complex compound sentence to list the examples ('bears have appeared..., leopards have been seen..., and wild pigs have been found...'). This shows a solid B1 competence in linking clauses. The vocabulary is appropriate for the level, and the paraphrasing of the original text is accurate and skillful."
