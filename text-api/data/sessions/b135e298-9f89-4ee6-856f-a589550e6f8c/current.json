    "text_translated": "It is common to see small animals like birds, squirrels, mice, and insects in many cities and towns. However, in recent years, there have been many reports of wild animals entering cities in larger numbers. For example, bears have appeared in Vancouver parks, leopards have been seen on the streets of Mumbai, and wild pigs have been found in gardens in Berlin. This raises the question of what happens when bigger animals come into our cities. Are they welcome, or are they considered a danger or a pest?",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates the ability to write simple, connected text on a familiar topic. The structure is very clear, using connectors like 'However' and 'For example' to create a logical and coherent flow between ideas. The sentence construction is also strong, effectively mixing simple sentences with a more complex compound sentence to list the examples ('bears have appeared..., leopards have been seen..., and wild pigs have been found...'). This shows a solid B1 competence in linking clauses. The vocabulary is appropriate for the level, and the paraphrasing of the original text is accurate and skillful.",
