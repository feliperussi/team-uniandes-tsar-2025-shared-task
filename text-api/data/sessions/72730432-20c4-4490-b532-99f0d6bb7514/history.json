Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found 8,000 so far. This means 17,000 of them have not been found yet. These asteroids are a serious danger. In 2013, a much smaller asteroid exploded over a city in Russia and injured 1,200 people. That asteroid was only 19 metres wide. Because of this, the larger asteroids would be a very serious danger if they came near Earth.",

        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to overly complex sentence structures and excessive length. The sentence 'NASA is now trying to find and record information about smaller asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more' is 21 words long, exceeding the B1 limit. The sentence 'Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found 8,000 so far' is also too long at 20 words. Furthermore, the final sentence uses a second conditional ('would be... if they came'), which is too advanced for the B1 standard. Sentences must be shorter and use simpler grammatical forms."
