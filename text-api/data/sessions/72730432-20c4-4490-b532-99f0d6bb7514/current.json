    "text_translated": "Asteroids are large rocks that fly in space. NASA is now trying to find and record smaller asteroids. They are looking for ones that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. However, they have only found 8,000 so far. This means 17,000 have not been found yet. These asteroids are a serious danger. In 2013, a much smaller asteroid exploded over a city in Russia. It injured 1,200 people, but it was only 19 metres wide. If these larger asteroids come near Earth, they will be a very serious danger.",
