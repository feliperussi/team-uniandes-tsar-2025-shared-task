The text was classified as B1, which is an instant failure. The A2 standard was not met due to specific structural and vocabulary violations.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'Carol Dweck is a person who studies how people think' uses a relative clause ('who studies...'). This is a B1 grammatical structure. A2 requires simpler, separate sentences.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text includes words above the A2 level. The word 'means' is B2. The word 'planning' is B1. These are unacceptable.\n\n- Definition Violation: The definition for the keyword 'growth mindset' uses the B2 word 'means'. Definitions must use A1/A2 vocabulary only.\n\nSuggestion: Split the first sentence into two. For example: 'Carol Dweck is a person. She studies how people think.'\n\nSuggestion: Remove and replace all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'means' with an A2 phrase like 'This idea is...'. Replace 'planning things' with an A2 phrase like 'making plans for things'.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the keyword definition to eliminate the word 'means'.",

Use an A2-compliant term such as 'hard work'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'making plans for things'. Use a simple verb phrase like 'plan things well'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'ways of finding answers'.

The term 'plasticity of the brain' was reduced to 'our brains can change', and 'problem-solving strategies' became 'ways to solve problems'. This loses important lexical detail and fails to meet the fidelity standard.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Grammar): The text uses noun clauses, which are a B1-level structure.
