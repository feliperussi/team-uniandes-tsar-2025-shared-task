While the simplification is clear and factually accurate, the language used is too basic for the target B1 audience. The initial definitions, 'A coincidence is when two things happen by chance at the same time' and 'A prophecy is when someone says something will happen in the future,' use very simple A1/A2 sentence structures and vocabulary, which significantly lowers the overall CEFR score. The original text, while not overly complex, implies these concepts rather than explicitly defining them in such a direct manner. To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating the definitions more subtly or using slightly more complex sentence structures and B1-level connectors. For example, instead of two separate, very short sentences for definitions, you could combine them or embed the explanation within a slightly more complex sentence. The vocabulary, apart from 'tend' (B1), is predominantly A1/A2, contributing to the lower classification.",

The simplification of phrases like 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' to 'usually just a coincidence, not a prophecy' contributes to this lower classification. Additionally, the overall sentence structures are very direct and simple, which aligns more with an A2 level. To achieve a B1 level, consider introducing slightly more varied sentence structures or more nuanced vocabulary where appropriate, while still maintaining clarity. For example, the original phrasing 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' could be adapted to 'are often just a coincidence, rather than a prophecy' to retain a bit more complexity without being overly difficult. The use of 'tend to forget' is a good B1 vocabulary choice, but the surrounding sentence structure keeps the overall complexity low.",

While the text maintains factual integrity and meaning, the simplification strategy has resulted in a lower complexity level than required. Specifically, the phrase 'are often just a coincidence, rather than a prophecy' is a simpler construction than the original's 'are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy'. Additionally, the use of 'This is because' to link the two sentences creates a very explicit and simple causal connection, which tends to align with A2 level discourse markers, whereas the original's 'And, of course,' introduced a related but slightly more nuanced point. To achieve a B1 level, consider using slightly more varied sentence structures or more sophisticated connectors. For example, instead of 'This is because', a phrase like 'It is also true that' or 'Furthermore' could introduce the second point while maintaining a B1 complexity.",

The first sentence, 'Dreams of a phone call from an old friend or the death of someone close, for example, are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy,' remains unchanged from the original. This sentence contains vocabulary such as 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' which are typically B2 or higher. Additionally, the use of 'Furthermore' as a connector in the second sentence is also considered B2 vocabulary. The overall sentence structure, particularly the length and complexity of the first sentence, also contributes to the B2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider simplifying the vocabulary (e.g., replacing 'coincidence' with 'chance' or 'accident', and 'prophecy' with 'a prediction of the future'). The first sentence could also be split into two shorter, simpler sentences to reduce its complexity. Replace 'Furthermore' with a simpler B1 connector like 'Also' or 'In addition'.",
