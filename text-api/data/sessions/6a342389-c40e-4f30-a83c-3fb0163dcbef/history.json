An investigation is when engineers look closely to find out what happened. Material means the things used to make the bridge, like metal or wood. Construction is the process of building the bridge. A defect is a problem or fault in the bridge. Weight is how heavy something is.\n\nSometimes a bridge falls down, but no one knows the reason at first. Engineers do an investigation to understand the problem. The bridge can fall because the material was not good. Or there might be a defect, a problem with a part of the bridge. Sometimes a bridge is made to hold only a certain weight. If more weight is on the bridge, it can break and fall down.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The Writer's Output introduces many definitions and explanations that are not part of the Original Text and changes the focus. It extensively adds definitions for terms like 'bridge', 'engineers', and 'investigation', which were not in the original. This alters the core message by making the text about definitions rather than the cause of bridge collapses. FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5799 is well below the required 0.75, showing the key original message about causes of bridge collapses is lost. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore is 0.8752, below the 0.90 threshold, reflecting missing key lexical items and factual phrasing such as 'engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation'. FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated B1, which is too complex for A2. This is due to the use of complex nominalizations and abstraction in definitions (e.g., 'Investigation is when engineers look closely to find out what happened'), and unnecessarily complex explanations that go beyond simple sentence structures. Vocabulary notes reveal many B1 and higher words remain present ('closely', 'used', 'fault', 'investigation', 'means', 'construction', 'defect'). Suggestion: Do not add extra definitions or explanations not found in the original. Focus on retelling the core message about bridge collapses and their causes using only simple sentences and vocabulary strictly within A2. Remove all B1+ words. Simplify sentence structures by removing complex clauses and avoid nominalizations. Use only and, but, so as connectors. Retain original facts exactly without deviation.",
