Or there can be a problem with a part of the bridge. Also, some bridges hold only a certain weight. If more weight is on the bridge, it can break and fall.",

    "text_translated": "A bridge is a structure for cars and people to cross rivers or roads. Engineers are people who design and build bridges. An investigation is when engineers look closely to find out what happened. Material means the things used to make the bridge, like metal or wood. Construction is the process of building the bridge. A defect is a problem or fault in the bridge. Weight is how heavy something is.\n\nSometimes a bridge falls down, but no one knows the reason at first. Engineers do an investigation to understand the problem. The bridge can fall because the material was not good. Or there might be a defect, a problem with a part of the bridge. Sometimes a bridge is made to hold only a certain weight. If more weight is on the bridge, it can break and fall down.",
