While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT 0.89, BERTScore 0.95), it oversimplified the language, resulting in a text that is too basic for the target B1 audience. For example, phrases like 'modern tools' instead of 'technology', 'showed him the way' instead of 'helped guide him', 'wrote down his daily experiences' instead of 'recording his day-to-day experiences', and 'interest from the news' instead of 'media interest' all contribute to a more elementary vocabulary and sentence structure. The frequent use of simple conjunctions like 'and' and very direct phrasing keeps the complexity at an A2 level. To achieve a B1 classification, the text should incorporate a slightly wider range of B1 vocabulary, more varied sentence structures (e.g., more complex subordinate clauses, varied sentence beginnings), and a more sophisticated use of connectors beyond simple 'and' or 'while'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 1.0 and BERTScore of 1.0 indicate perfect preservation of meaning and fidelity, which is expected as the texts are identical. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as B1, meeting the target level. While the original text already meets the B1 CEFR requirement, the task of simplification implies making changes to reduce complexity where possible. The vocabulary analysis identified 'destruction' (B2) and 'terrain' (C1) as candidates for replacement. Although the overall text is B1, simplifying these specific words would have further enhanced the text for a B1 audience. For future tasks, even when the original text is already at the target CEFR level, consider simplifying individual higher-level vocabulary words to demonstrate the simplification process and achieve optimal clarity.",
