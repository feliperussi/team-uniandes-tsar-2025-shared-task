    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6224 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to capture the core meaning of the original source.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states the complaint was that shooting pigs was 'unnecessarily cruel'. Your version simplifies this to 'wrong' and 'hurt the animals too much'. This simplification loses the critical concept that the action was not just bad, but also not necessary, which was the basis for the protests.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'peaceful', which is a B1 level word. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the gerund 'killing'. While 'kill' is A1, its use as a noun here ('killing wild pigs') is a more complex B1 structure.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to restore the original meaning. State 'People said it was not necessary to kill the pigs with guns'. Replace 'peaceful plan' with 'a plan that was better for the animals' or 'a plan that did not hurt the pigs'. Replace 'killing wild pigs' with 'to kill wild pigs'.",
