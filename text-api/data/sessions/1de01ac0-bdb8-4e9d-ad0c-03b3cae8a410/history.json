        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'This is especially true for modern bridges, because engineers have learned to build them in areas with earthquakes on ground that is much stronger against movement' is 29 words long and combines multiple clauses, which is characteristic of a B2 level. To meet the B1 requirement, this sentence should be split into two or more shorter sentences. For instance: 'This is especially true for modern bridges. Engineers have learned to build them on ground that is much stronger against movement.' On a positive note, the text passed all factual and meaning checks, and the vocabulary simplification was excellent.",

The output is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning, as confirmed by a strong MeaningBERT score of 0.78 and a BERTScore of 0.94. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is particularly effective, with excellent replacements such as 'infrequent' becoming 'not very common', 'collapse' being simplified to 'fall down', and 'resistant' being replaced with 'stronger'. The sentence structure is clear and flows well. No corrective actions are required.",
