    "feedback": "PASS: This is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets all evaluation criteria. The output is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning, as confirmed by a strong MeaningBERT score of 0.78 and a BERTScore of 0.94. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is particularly effective, with excellent replacements such as 'infrequent' becoming 'not very common', 'collapse' being simplified to 'fall down', and 'resistant' being replaced with 'stronger'. The sentence structure is clear and flows well. No corrective actions are required.",
