This indicates a loss of the core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states Pi is 'trapped in a lifeboat'. Your version, 'He is on a small boat', fails to convey the critical meaning of being unable to escape. The concept of being 'trapped' is central to the story's premise and its removal is a significant alteration of meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary: The C1 word 'diplomat' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms. This was executed correctly.\n\n- Structure: The use of short, simple sentences is appropriate for the A2 level.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning of being trapped. Rephrase the sentence to 'He is stuck on a small boat' or 'He cannot leave the small boat'."

B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'A diplomat is a person who works for their country in other countries' uses a relative clause ('who works...'). This is a B1 structure. A2 learners are not expected to produce or fully understand this. B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'When Martel was a child, he lived in Costa Rica...' uses a subordinate clause of time ('When...'). This is a B1 structure. A2 requires simpler, conjoined sentences. Vocabulary: The use of the C1 word 'diplomat' is only acceptable because it is defined. However, the definition itself introduced a B1 grammatical structure, compounding the error. Suggestion: Rewrite the complex sentences. Split them into simple, declarative statements. For the definition: 'Martel's father was a diplomat. A diplomat works for their country in other countries.' For the childhood sentence: 'Martel was a child.
