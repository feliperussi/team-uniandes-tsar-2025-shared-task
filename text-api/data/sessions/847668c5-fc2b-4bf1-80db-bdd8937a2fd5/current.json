    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6168 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The original text specifies that engineers design bridges on areas 'resistant to movement'. Your version simplifies this to 'ground that is very strong'. While related, 'strong' does not accurately capture the specific engineering concept of resistance to seismic movement. The nuance is lost, causing the metric failure. Suggestion: Restore the core concept. Rephrase to explain that the ground is chosen because it does not move much. For example: 'They build bridges on ground that does not move a lot during an earthquake.'",
