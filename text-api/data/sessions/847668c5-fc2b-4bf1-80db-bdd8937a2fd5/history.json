Your version, 'They know how to build safe bridges', describes a state of being, not a process of learning. This is a critical loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8991 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is caused by replacing specific terminology like 'resistant to movement' with the overly simplistic 'does not move a lot', which loses lexical precision.\n- Over-simplification: The text is broken down into too many short, disconnected sentences. For example, 'They build them on ground that is very strong. This ground does not move a lot.' This structure, while simple, makes the text choppy and further dilutes the original's more integrated concept.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. The text must convey that engineers have learned a skill over time.

An A2-compliant text would use a phrase like 'when the ground shakes'.\n- Factual Inaccuracy: The original text uses the word 'structures'. Your replacement, 'buildings', is factually incorrect. A bridge is a structure, not a building. This alters the factual basis of the statement.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by focusing on the action of building on strong ground.
