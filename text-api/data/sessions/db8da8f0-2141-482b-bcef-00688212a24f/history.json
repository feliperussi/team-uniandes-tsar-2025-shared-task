This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core meaning during the simplification process.\n\n*   **Meaning Distortion:** The original text defines a PHA by its proximity to \"Earth's orbit.\" Your output simplifies this to flying \"very close to Earth.\" This is a significant factual and conceptual error. An asteroid's orbit can be close to Earth's orbit without the asteroid itself being currently close to Earth. This nuance is essential to the definition and has been completely lost.\n*   **Loss of Nuance:** The original states NASA can \"make predictions about possible impact,\" which implies forecasting and uncertainty. Your version, \"It can know if a rock is going to hit Earth,\" incorrectly implies absolute certainty. This changes the meaning from prediction to definite knowledge.\n*   **Structural Simplification Error:** While the sentences are simple, the phrase \"This is when they fly...\" is an imprecise and weak connection. It fails to properly define the term that precedes it.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning with A2 language. Restore the concept of \"Earth's orbit\" by using a phrase like \"their path in space is close to Earth's path.\" Change \"can know if\" back to a concept of prediction, such as \"can say if a rock might hit Earth.\""

The simplification process has removed critical nuance from the original text, resulting in a loss of the core message's scientific precision.\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original text describes a formal process of scientific prediction ('expected to be a threat', 'make predictions'). Your version oversimplifies this to absolute statements ('are a danger') and general abilities ('can say if a rock might hit Earth'). This loses the crucial concept that NASA is making calculated forecasts, not just watching rocks.\n*   **Precision Loss:** The original text uses the specific term 'Earth's orbit'. Your replacement, 'Earth's path', is less precise and degrades the scientific accuracy of the statement.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The word 'means' is listed as B2. While its use in the phrase 'This means' is common, it is still above the target level and should have been avoided. A phrase like 'This is when...' would be more appropriate for A2.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Focus on conveying the idea of 'prediction' and 'forecasting' using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of 'It can say if a rock might hit Earth', use 'NASA can use technology to know if a rock will come near Earth in the future'."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message during simplification.\n\n*   **MeaningBERT Violation:** The low score quantifies a loss of nuance. The original text presents a formal definition: a specific category of asteroid ('Potentially Hazardous Asteroids') is defined by a specific condition ('pass within 7.5 million kilometres'). Your version separates these concepts into disjointed statements ('Some asteroids can be dangerous. We call them... This is when...'). This fragmentation damages the logical link and weakens the core definition, which is a critical failure in meaning preservation.\n*   **Structural Weakness:** While the sentences are simple, their arrangement fails to replicate the cause-and-effect structure of the original text. The original's tone is that of a scientific report; your version reads like a list of disconnected facts, which is a different meaning.\n\nSuggestion: You must restructure the text to preserve the original's logical flow. Combine the fragmented ideas. Rephrase the definition of PHAs to be a single, clear statement that directly links the name to the reason, as the original text does.
