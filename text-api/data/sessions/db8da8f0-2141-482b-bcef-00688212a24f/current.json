    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some asteroids are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). Their path comes very close to the path Earth takes around the sun. They fly less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth's path. NASA has a map of 1,400 PHAs. But NASA says none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA uses technology to follow these rocks. This helps NASA know where the rocks are going to go. If a rock is a danger, NASA has two ways to protect Earth.",
