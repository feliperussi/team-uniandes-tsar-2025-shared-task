        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6581 is too low, indicating a loss of the original text's core message about NASA's ongoing planetary defense efforts and the status of asteroid logging. The BERTScore of 0.8967 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key lexical detail.\n\nDeviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation: The original text's primary focus is on NASA's progress in identifying and logging asteroids and their assessed danger. Your version begins with a general definition of 'near-Earth objects', which shifts the initial focus and dilutes the core message about NASA's specific work and findings.\n*   Lexical Fidelity: Key terms from the original text were not adequately preserved or simplified, contributing to the low BERTScore.\n    *   'planetary defence team' was simplified to 'a team', losing the specific function of 'planetary defence'.\n    *   'asteroids' was replaced with 'big rocks', losing the precise scientific term.\n    *   'logged' was replaced with 'looked for' and 'found', which are related but do not fully capture the ongoing process of 'logging' or cataloging.\n    *   'Earth's orbit' was simplified to 'from Earth', losing the specific concept of orbital proximity.\n    *   'significant danger to the planet' was simplified to 'not a big danger for Earth'. While acceptable for A2, the change in specific words contributes to the BERTScore reduction.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the introduction to immediately focus on NASA's work and findings as presented in the original text. Ensure that key concepts like 'planetary defence' and 'asteroids' are either retained or simplified in a way that preserves more lexical fidelity while remaining A2. For example, 'space rocks' is a more precise A2 alternative to 'big rocks'. Focus on the 'logging' aspect more directly to maintain the original meaning.",
