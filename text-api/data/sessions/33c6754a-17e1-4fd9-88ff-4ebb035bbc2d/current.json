    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully adheres to all A2 readability standards and diagnostic protocols. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8145) and BERTScore (0.9118) metrics are well within the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is appropriately simplified, using A1/A2 words like 'space rocks' for 'asteroids' and 'Earth's path' for 'Earth's orbit'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate usage ('and'). No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
