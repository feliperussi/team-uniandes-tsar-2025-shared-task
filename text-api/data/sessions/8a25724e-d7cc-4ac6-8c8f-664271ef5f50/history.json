This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary cause of this failure is the oversimplification of key concepts. The original text specifies a recent and increasing trend with the phrase 'in recent years... in bigger and bigger numbers'. Your version, 'But now, things are different', is too vague and loses this specific meaning. Additionally, the omission of 'insects' from the list of small animals contributes to a minor loss of detail. While the text correctly adheres to A2 vocabulary and sentence structure, the loss of meaning is a critical failure. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Replace 'But now, things are different' with a sentence that captures the idea of a recent increase. For example: 'But in the last few years, this has changed.' This must be corrected.",

The output meets all quantitative and qualitative requirements for the A2 level.\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, locations, and animal types from the original text are preserved without error.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.78 and BERTScore of 0.93 are well within the acceptable thresholds, confirming high fidelity to the source text. The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The replacement of the B1 word 'pest' with the A1 word 'problem' is a correct and necessary simplification for this level.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is correctly broken down into short, simple declarative sentences and questions. The use of connectors is limited to A2-appropriate words ('and', 'but', 'or'). The output is a model of A2 simplification.",
