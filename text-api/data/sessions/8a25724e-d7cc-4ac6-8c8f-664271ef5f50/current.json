All locations, animals, and the core message are identical to the original text.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: Meaning and fidelity metrics are above the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.78 and BERTScore at 0.93 confirm accurate content preservation.\n- CEFR Compliance: The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: A full audit confirms strict adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is confined to the A1/A2 levels. B1-level words from the original, such as 'pest' and 'considered', have been correctly simplified to 'problem' and 'think'. Sentence structure is exemplary, using short, simple clauses and basic connectors ('and', 'but'). The submission is a model of compliance.",
