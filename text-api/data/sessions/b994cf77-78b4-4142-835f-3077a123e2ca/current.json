    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an event that happens every year. The Capitol uses the games to show the people in the districts they did something wrong. The districts are the different parts of the country. The Capitol does this because the people fought against the government. Every year, the Capitol chooses one boy and one girl from each district. It chooses their names by chance. They are between 12 and 18 years old. The Capitol calls these teenagers 'tributes'. A tribute is a person who must fight in the games. They all fight, but only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country must watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It correctly breaks down complex sentences into simple, declarative ones. It successfully replaces B1/C1 vocabulary ('punished', 'rebelling', 'lottery', 'survive') with A2 equivalents ('did something wrong', 'fought against the government', 'by chance', 'stay alive'). Necessary keywords ('districts', 'tributes') are introduced and immediately defined using A2-level language. The text is factually identical to the original. No violations.",
