The word 'government' is B1 level and is used without explanation in the sentence 'The Capitol punishes them because they fought against the government.' The word 'lottery' is also B1 and is used without simplification in 'a lottery chooses one boy and one girl'. Explaining 'tributes' was correct, but this does not excuse the other vocabulary failures. The text is not exclusively at the A2 level."

        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to vocabulary violations. The word 'punish' is B1 level and is used twice without simplification or explanation. This is a clear breach of the A2-only vocabulary rule. Instead of 'punish', use an A2-level phrase like 'to show them they did something wrong'. Additionally, the text uses the passive voice ('are chosen', 'are picked'). While these are simple forms, active voice is strongly preferred for A2 clarity. The simplification of 'lottery' to 'picked by chance' and the immediate definition of the B1 noun 'districts' were correct procedures, but do not compensate for the other errors."

It successfully replaces B1/C1 vocabulary ('punished', 'rebelling', 'lottery', 'survive') with A2 equivalents ('did something wrong', 'fought against the government', 'by chance', 'stay alive'). Necessary keywords ('districts', 'tributes') are introduced and immediately defined using A2-level language. The text is factually identical to the original. No violations."
