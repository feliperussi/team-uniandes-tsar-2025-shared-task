    "text_translated": "Stereotypes are simple ideas about a group of people. These ideas are often not true. People from different countries can act in different ways. They can also expect different things. It is good to know about these differences. This can help us avoid problems when we talk. But we must be careful. Stereotypes can be very bad for building good business relationships. A person's country is only one part of who they are. Many other things influence a person. The area they come from is important. Their age and gender are important. Their company culture is important. Their own experiences in life are also important. So, it is good to know about cultural differences. But we should keep this knowledge in the back of our minds. We should not use it to judge people. We must not think all people from one country are the same. We need to see each person as an individual.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5857 is critically below the 0.75 threshold. This is an instant failure. The original text's core message about the nuanced application of cultural awareness was lost and replaced with a simplistic anti-stereotype message.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.887 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'miscommunication' and 'pigeonhole' were completely lost, reducing the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The presence of B1 vocabulary is the cause.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The words 'influence', 'gender', 'cultural', and 'judge' are not on the A2 wordlist. Their use is a direct violation of the standard.\n\n- Corrective Action: You must rewrite the text to restore the original meaning. The focus is on knowing about differences but keeping that knowledge in the 'back of your mind' instead of using it to form fixed ideas. Remove all B1 vocabulary. Replace 'influence' with a phrase like 'change how a person is'. Replace 'cultural' with 'about countries'. Replace 'judge' with 'to make a simple idea about'.",
