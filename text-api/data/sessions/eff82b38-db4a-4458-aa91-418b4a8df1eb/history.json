Your version reduces this to a simple warning against stereotypes, losing the central argument entirely. The BERTScore of 0.8747 also fails the minimum 0.90 requirement, indicating a significant loss of key phrasing.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not A2.

Example: 'It is good to know that people can be different.' This is a B1 structure.\n- B2 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'making' in 'making good business connections' is rated B2. This is unacceptable. A2 vocabulary is mandatory.\n\nSuggestion: The text requires a complete rewrite. You must restore the original meaning about the correct application of cultural knowledge. Eliminate all relative clauses by splitting sentences. For example, rewrite 'The country we are from can change how we act' to 'We are from a country. This can change how we act.'

The simplification is so extreme that the text no longer represents the original's intent.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the core message.

A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8695, which is below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a significant loss of key vocabulary and concepts.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text presents a balanced argument: be aware of cultural differences to avoid miscommunication, but do not use this awareness to stereotype. Your version oversimplifies this into a basic warning against stereotypes, losing the critical nuance of using cultural knowledge carefully. The concept of 'avoiding miscommunication' is almost entirely lost.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: Key concepts from the original were deleted, not simplified. The text lost terms like 'miscommunication', 'expectations', 'behaviour', and 'individual experiences'. This is the cause of the low BERTScore.\n\n- Over-simplification: The phrase 'detrimental to building good business relationships' was changed to 'destroy good business relationships'. The verb 'destroy' is too absolute and fails to capture the more subtle, damaging process described in the original.\n\n- Incomplete Information: The original lists multiple influences on a person: region, communities, age, gender, corporate culture, and individual experiences. Your version reduces this to age, gender, company culture, and 'life', which is vague and loses important detail.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. You must restore the original's core message about the dual need for awareness and caution. Re-introduce the concept of 'avoiding problems in communication'. Replace 'destroy' with a phrase that better reflects 'detrimental', such as 'can hurt' or 'can make it hard to build'. Ensure all key influences on a person mentioned in the original are included in a simplified form."

The groups they are part of are also important. Their age, their gender, their company's culture, and their own life experiences are important too. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we must not think everyone from one country is the same.",

Your version, 'Using these wrong ideas can hurt business relationships', is significantly weaker and loses the original's professional tone and urgency.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The output consists of a series of short, disconnected, and repetitive sentences. The section 'Their age is important. If they are a man or a woman is important. Their company is important.

The use of a gerund ('Using') as the subject of a sentence is a B1 structure.\n  - 'But it is only one part of who they are.' The relative clause 'who they are' is a B1 structure.\n  - 'It is also important if they are a man or a woman.' The use of an 'if' clause in this manner is too complex for A2.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original's strong warning about stereotypes.

The BERTScore of 0.86 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity due to oversimplification.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text presents a nuanced argument about balancing cultural awareness against the dangers of stereotyping in a professional context. Your output reduces this to a set of disconnected, overly simplistic statements. The concept of 'pigeonholing' is completely lost. The professional warning about being 'detrimental to building good business relationships' is weakened to the generic 'very bad for work relationships'.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The low score is a direct result of replacing key terminology with basic A1 words. 'Miscommunication' became 'problems at work'. 'Increased awareness' became 'It is good to know this'. This level of simplification destroys the fidelity of the original message.\n\n- Excessive Simplification: While the output correctly classifies as A2, it has been simplified to the point of losing its meaning. The goal is A2 readability, not A1-level reductionism that sacrifices the source text's intent.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the text. Restore the core concepts from the original. Use simple A2 language to explain 'miscommunication' (e.g., 'problems when people do not understand each other'). Rephrase to better capture the meaning of 'detrimental' (e.g., 'can damage' or 'makes it hard to build'). The text must preserve the professional tone and central argument of the source."

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5533 is far below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8691 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates the simplification process has destroyed the core message and lexical accuracy of the original text. The text also fails on CEFR compliance, being rated B1 instead of A2.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5533 shows a severe deviation from the original meaning. The original text's core message is a nuanced warning about how cultural knowledge should be used as background information, not as a tool to 'pigeonhole' people. Your version oversimplifies this into a basic list, losing the critical concept of the warning.\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8691 confirms a significant loss of key vocabulary. Terms like 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', and 'pigeonhole' were replaced, which stripped the text of its specific meaning.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The text contains multiple grammatical structures that are too advanced for the A2 level.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The sentence 'Using stereotypes is bad for good relationships at work' uses a gerund ('Using') as the subject, which is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The clause '...make a person who they are' is a relative clause, a B1-level construction.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The sentence 'If they are a man or a woman is also important' uses a subordinate clause as the subject of the main verb. This is a complex B1 structure.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the original's core warning. The message is not just that differences exist, but that knowledge of them can be dangerous if used incorrectly.\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 grammatical structures. Break complex sentences into simple, single-clause sentences.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'Using stereotypes is bad...'. Command: Change to 'Do not use stereotypes. It is bad for relationships at work.'\n- Suggestion: Rephrase '...make a person who they are'. Command: Change to 'Many other things make a person different.'\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'If they are a man or a woman is also important'. Command: Change to 'Their gender is also important. For example, a person can be a man or a woman.'"

The original text's core message about using cultural knowledge as a background tool rather than a method for 'pigeonholing' individuals was lost. Your version oversimplifies this to a generic 'every person is different', failing to capture the specific warning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8666 is below the 0.90 minimum.

This is an automatic failure. The classification was likely influenced by B1-level vocabulary and sentence structures.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'gender' was used. This is not on the A2 wordlist and is unacceptable. Explaining it afterwards does not correct the initial violation.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'We should not think everyone from a country is the same' uses an implied 'that-clause' ('think that...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. A2 level requires simpler, more direct sentences.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to more accurately reflect the original's warning against stereotyping in a business context. Remove the word 'gender'. Break down all complex sentences into simple subject-verb-object forms. For example, change 'We should not think everyone from a country is the same' to 'Everyone from a country is not the same. We must remember this.'"

This is a B1 structure.\n\n- Stylistic Failure: The repetitive use of the phrase 'is important' is unnatural and demonstrates a failure to use varied A2-level sentence patterns.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text from the beginning. Focus on conveying the original meaning using only simple sentences. Eliminate all complex clauses. Break down every idea into a separate subject-verb-object sentence. For example, rewrite 'It is good to know that people...' as 'People from different cultures act in different ways. We should know this.' Rewrite 'It is important if a person is a man or a woman' as 'A person's gender is also important.'"

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5507 is far below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.883 is below the required 0.90. This indicates the core message and key vocabulary of the original text were not preserved.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's central warning is nuanced: cultural knowledge should be kept 'at the back of our minds' and not used to 'pigeonhole' people. Your version simplifies this to 'be careful not to use stereotypes', losing the specific instruction on how to correctly handle cultural information.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification is a direct result of using sentence structures that are too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Violations: The text contains multiple B1 structures. The sentence 'Using stereotypes is very bad...' uses a gerund as a subject. The clause '...make a person who they are' is a B1 relative clause. The sentence '...we must not think that everyone from one country is the same' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The phrase 'business relationships' is B1-level vocabulary.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original's specific warning about misusing cultural knowledge. Break down all complex sentences. Replace 'Using stereotypes is...' with an A2 structure like 'It is bad to use stereotypes...'. Simplify the clause 'who they are'. Remove the 'that-clause'.

The text fails to communicate the original's primary warning effectively.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the direct link between cultural knowledge and the danger of stereotyping. The text must convey that the same knowledge can be helpful for awareness but harmful if used to create stereotypes. Rephrase to better capture the idea of 'building relationships'."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.867 is below the 0.90 minimum, showing a failure to retain key phrasing.\n\n- Core Message Lost: The original text presents a nuanced argument about using cultural awareness carefully while avoiding stereotypes. Your version reduces this to a simple warning that 'stereotypes are bad', losing the central idea of balancing knowledge with individuality. The original's point is not just to avoid stereotypes, but how to use cultural knowledge correctly.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key concepts were oversimplified, causing the low BERTScore. The phrase 'detrimental to building good business relationships' became 'hurt good business relationships'. The specific concept of 'pigeonhole the individuals' was lost and replaced with the less precise 'think all people from one country are the same'.\n\n- Omission of Key Concepts: The original text mentions 'corporate culture' and 'individual experiences' as important influences. Your text omits 'corporate culture' entirely and simplifies 'individual experiences' to 'their own life also changes them', which is vague.\n\n- Added Content: The final sentence, 'We need to see each person as a different person,' is an interpretation not explicitly stated in the original text. Adhere strictly to the source material.\n\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text. Focus on preserving the original's main point: it is useful to know about cultural differences, but this knowledge should be a background guide, not a tool to judge individuals. Restore the concepts of 'corporate culture' and 'personal experiences'. Do not add your own conclusions."

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8644, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text presents a nuanced argument: awareness of cultural differences is useful, but we must avoid stereotypes because many other factors shape a person. Your version separates these into disconnected points, losing the critical 'but' that connects them. The core warning is diluted.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because key lexical items from the original text such as 'awareness', 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', and 'pigeonhole' were completely removed. This results in a text that does not faithfully represent the original's vocabulary.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The cause is structural, not lexical.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The text uses sentence structures that are above the A2 level. Sentences like 'The part of the country they come from is important' and 'The groups they are in are important' contain relative clauses, which are a B1-level grammatical feature. The sentence 'If they are a man or a woman is important' is also structurally too complex for A2.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the central argument by directly linking the ideas with 'but'. Break down all complex sentences. Replace 'The part of the country they come from is important' with 'Where a person comes from is also important.' Simplify the gender sentence to 'Being a man or a woman is also important.'"

The central concept that knowledge of differences should be kept 'at the back of our minds' is completely lost.\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8648 is below the 0.90 minimum.

The output is factually weak and fails its primary purpose.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Focus on restoring the original message.

The original text presents a nuanced argument about holding knowledge of cultural differences 'at the back of our minds' rather than using it to 'pigeonhole' people. Your output loses this subtlety, creating a much simpler and less accurate message.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8698 is below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects the loss of key lexical concepts from the original, such as 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', and 'pigeonhole', without adequate A2-level replacement.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n\n- B1 Sentence Structure: The B1 classification was caused by the repeated use of relative clauses, a B1-level structure. Examples include: '...make a person who they are', 'The area they come from...', and 'The company they work for...'.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word 'gender' is B1 level. It must be replaced with an A2 equivalent.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be completely rewritten. Focus on restoring the original meaning about how to use cultural knowledge correctly. Eliminate all relative clauses by splitting them into separate, simple sentences. Replace 'gender' with 'if a person is a man or a woman'."

Terms like 'miscommunication', 'detrimental to building good business relationships', and 'pigeonhole' were replaced with overly simplistic phrases, losing lexical precision.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is due to multiple instances of B1-level grammatical structures.\n\n- Structural Deviation 1: The sentence 'Using stereotypes is very bad for work relationships' uses a gerund ('Using') as the subject. This is a B1 structure. Suggestion: Rephrase into two simple sentences. 'Do not use stereotypes. It is bad for work relationships.'\n\n- Structural Deviation 2: The sentence 'If a person is a man or a woman is important' is grammatically complex and unnatural for A2. Suggestion: Rephrase to 'It is also important if a person is a man or a woman.'\n\n- Structural Deviation 3: The text uses multiple 'that-clauses', such as 'It is good to know that...' and 'we should remember that...'. While one might be acceptable, repeated use elevates the complexity to B1. Suggestion: Break these sentences apart. For example, 'We should remember something. Differences can exist.'"
