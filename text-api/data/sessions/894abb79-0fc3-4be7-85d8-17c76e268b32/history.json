Replacing 'negotiating with my boss' with 'talked with my manager' and 'significant cut' with 'big cut' loses too much of the original phrasing, even if the basic meaning is similar.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses words above the A2 level. 'lower' is a B2 comparative. 'means' is a B2 verb. These are not permitted.\n\n- Definition Failure: The definition 'Pro\u2011rata basis means pay is calculated based on the time you work' is not A2 compliant. It uses the B2 word 'means' and the B1/B2 word 'calculated'.\n\n- Structural Weakness: The text is a list of disconnected simple sentences. While simple sentences are required, the complete lack of basic A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' makes the text choppy and unnatural.\n\nSuggestion: Restore more of the original phrasing in simplified A2 terms to increase the BERTScore. Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary immediately. Rewrite the definition for 'pro-rata basis' using only A1/A2 words, for example: 'Pro-rata pay is when your pay depends on how many hours you work.'

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails at the second and most critical diagnostic stage. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6688 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a severe loss of the original message's narrative and emotional context. The BERTScore of 0.8774 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a failure to retain key lexical items.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6688 is unacceptable. The original text conveys a story of realization and frustration. Your output is a sterile list of facts that loses this core meaning.\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8774 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'parental leave' and 'pro-rata basis' were handled poorly, damaging fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier correctly rated your text as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B1): You failed to replace the B1 word 'significant'. It must be removed.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B2/C1): You introduced the word 'proportionally'. This is a C1-level adverb and a complete violation of A2 standards. This single word makes the text incomprehensible to an A2 reader.\n- Structural Violation (B1): The sentence 'We agreed I would work three days' uses an implicit 'that-clause', a B1 grammatical structure. This is too complex for A2.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite from scratch. Remove the word 'significant'. Remove the word 'proportionally'. Rephrase the concept of pro-rata pay using only A1/A2 words. Example: 'I only get paid for the three days I work.' Break the B1 sentence structure. Example: 'My boss and I agreed. I will work three days.' Use simple A2 connectors like 'but' and 'so' to restore a basic narrative.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states 'I'm now doing five days' worth of work in three days', which describes a current, ongoing situation. Your version changes this fact to 'I will try to finish five days of work in three days', which incorrectly presents it as a future intention.

Definitions for an A2 audience must not use B1+ vocabulary.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The use of the present perfect tense ('My work has not become less') and multiple instances of the passive voice ('is born', 'get paid', 'am paid') are B1-level grammatical structures and are inappropriate for the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error to reflect the current situation.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7196 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This is the primary reason for failure. The text also fails on multiple other critical points.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.7196 indicates a loss of the core message. The original text conveys frustration and injustice ('workload hasn't decreased in the slightest!', 'getting paid much less for it!'). Your version is a neutral list of facts, which is a different meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.86 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is caused by oversimplification. For example, 'significant cut in my pay' became 'My pay is now less', losing the original's lexical detail and emphasis.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure. The analysis shows this is due to B1-level grammar.\n\n- Grammatical Deviation: The sentences 'I am paid only for the three days I work' and 'I get paid only for the days I work' use relative clauses ('that I work'). This is a B1 structure and is not permitted at A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'parental' is C1 vocabulary. Using it directly in the text, even as a defined keyword, is a violation. The text must be comprehensible without relying on the reader retaining definitions of advanced words.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the meaning of frustration. Remove the B1 relative clauses by splitting the sentences. Example: 'I work three days a week. I am paid only for those three days.' Do not use the word 'parental' in the main text; after defining it, refer to it as 'this leave' or 'this time off'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7159 is below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.8653 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The text was broken down into excessively simple, disconnected sentences. This fragmentation destroyed the logical flow. For example, the original's causal link 'This of course meant a significant cut in my pay too, as I'm paid on a pro-rata basis' was lost.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases from the original text were replaced with overly simplistic terms, causing the low BERTScore. 'Significant cut' became 'cut... is big' and 'pro-rata basis' became 'based on the days I work'. This simplification sacrifices too much specific information.\n\n- Unfaithful Addition: The sentences 'I feel it is not fair. I feel bad about it' are an editorial addition. You have added information and emotion not explicitly present in the source text. Your task is to simplify, not to interpret and add new content.\n\n- Structural Failure: The output is a list of A1-level sentences, not a coherent A2 paragraph. There is a near-total absence of simple A2 connectors like 'but' or 'because' to link ideas.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. Combine the short, choppy sentences using basic A2 connectors like 'so' and 'but' to restore logical flow. Ensure the core concepts from the original text are preserved more accurately.
