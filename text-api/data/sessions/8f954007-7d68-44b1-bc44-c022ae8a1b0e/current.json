    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6481 is below the required 0.75 and thus fails to preserve the core message of rapid population growth fueled by health and technology improvements. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8846 is below the required 0.90, reflecting the loss of key phrases like \"fuelling rapid population growth\" and \"wider availability of contraception\". Suggestion: Restore the phrase \"fuelling rapid population growth\" to keep the causal link. Suggestion: Use \"improvements in technology and health\" instead of \"got better\". Suggestion: Replace \"got easier\" with \"wider availability of contraception\" to maintain lexical detail and precision.",
