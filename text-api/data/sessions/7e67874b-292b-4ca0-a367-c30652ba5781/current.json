Stereotypes are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like. National cultures can influence the way we behave and think.

These include the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age and gender, our company's culture, and our own personal experiences.

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.84 and BERTScore of 0.93 confirm that the core message and key details were preserved with high fidelity. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The writer's strategy was highly effective. The decision to split long, complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones significantly improved readability. The vocabulary handling was a key strength; the keyword 'stereotypes' was correctly identified and defined in-text, which is excellent practice. Furthermore, the difficult idiom 'to pigeonhole' was expertly rephrased into a simple, clear explanation ('put every person from an entire nation into a simple group'). This submission serves as a model for successful B1 simplification.",
