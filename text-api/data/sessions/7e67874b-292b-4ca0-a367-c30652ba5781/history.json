For example, the sentence 'However, it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes, which are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like, can be harmful to building good business relationships' uses a long, embedded non-defining relative clause. This is a grammatical structure more typical of the B2 level. Suggestion: Split this into two sentences. First, state the main point about stereotypes being harmful. Then, define stereotypes in a new, separate sentence. This will improve readability and meet B1 standards. While the vocabulary simplification was successful and the text passed all factual and meaning checks, the failure to simplify sentence grammar is critical.",
