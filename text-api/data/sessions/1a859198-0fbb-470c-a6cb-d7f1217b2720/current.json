He finished at the end of the river in Brazil. The walk took two years and four months. He walked 6,000 kilometres.\n\nThe Amazon forest has many dangerous animals. It has snakes that can kill people, crocodiles and jaguars. So, the walk was very dangerous for Ed.\n\nBut he was lucky. He was okay at the end. He only had thousands of bites from mosquitos and ants.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a factually accurate representation of the original text. All numbers, names, and core events are preserved.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8165 and BERTScore of 0.9309 are well above the required thresholds. This confirms the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly compliant. The simplification of 'poisonous snakes' to 'snakes that can kill people' is an exemplary A2 strategy. Sentence structure is ideal, using short, simple sentences and appropriate A2 connectors ('So', 'But'). The use of a defining relative clause ('that can kill people') is a correct and effective A2-level construction.\n\nNo deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
