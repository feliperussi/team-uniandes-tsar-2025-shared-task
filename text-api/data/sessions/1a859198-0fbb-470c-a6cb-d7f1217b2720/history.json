The text must be composed entirely of A2-level vocabulary or simpler.\n- Structural Compliance: The text's structure is correct. The use of short, simple sentences and basic connectors ('and', 'so', 'but') adheres to the A2 standard.\n- Metric Performance: The text passed all quantitative checks. MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.93) were above the required thresholds, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. However, the qualitative audit reveals the vocabulary failure.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'poisonous snakes' with a descriptive phrase using A2 vocabulary. Use 'snakes that can kill people' or 'snakes that are very bad for you'.",

This confirms the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly compliant. The simplification of 'poisonous snakes' to 'snakes that can kill people' is an exemplary A2 strategy. Sentence structure is ideal, using short, simple sentences and appropriate A2 connectors ('So', 'But'). The use of a defining relative clause ('that can kill people') is a correct and effective A2-level construction.\n\nNo deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
