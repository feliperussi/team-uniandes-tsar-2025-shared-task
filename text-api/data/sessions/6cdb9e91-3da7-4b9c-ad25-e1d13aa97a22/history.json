While the text successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, as shown by the high BERTScore (0.936) and MeaningBERT (0.8647) scores, it relied too heavily on A1-level vocabulary. For example, 'chart-topping' was replaced with 'very popular', and both 'fundamental' and 'relevant' were simplified to 'important'. Additionally, the complex opening sentence of the original was broken into two much simpler sentences. This simplification strategy, combined with the vocabulary choices, resulted in a text that lacks the complexity expected for the B1 level. To reach B1, consider re-introducing slightly more complex vocabulary or combining some of the shorter sentences to create more sophisticated structures."

The A2 classification is likely due to over-simplification in sentence structure.

To reach the B1 target, the text needs more consistently complex sentence structures. Suggestion: Combine the simpler sentences with others to demonstrate a higher level of grammatical control. For instance, 'Even though he is in his late 60s, it is not surprising that he is still one of the best musicians.'"
