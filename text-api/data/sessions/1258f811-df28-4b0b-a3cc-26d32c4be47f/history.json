This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and intent. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8888, which is below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key lexical information.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text presents a formal 'recommendation' based on 'findings'. Your version, 'We have new information. So, we think...', reduces this to a casual opinion. The professional, evidence-based tone is completely lost.\n\n- Lexical Loss: Key concepts were oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy. 'People-oriented management style' became 'think more about their workers', which is too general. 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'say \"good job\"', losing the nuance of reinforcement.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: While the sentences are simple, the simplification process has damaged the logical connection. The original text is a set of recommendations. Your version reads like a list of disconnected ideas.\n\nSuggestion: The introduction must be rewritten to convey a formal recommendation. Use a structure like: 'Our information shows that Girox Foods needs to change. We recommend these things:'. This restores the formal tone. Suggestion: Restore the key concepts more accurately. 'Professional development' is not just 'training'; it is about helping workers get better at their jobs. This distinction must be made clear in simple terms. Suggestion: Ensure the connection between the findings and the recommendations is explicit, even in simple language.",

Your version simplifies this to 'focus more on their workers', which is vague and loses the specific, established meaning of the original term.\n\n- Weakened Causality: The original states that investment in development 'could also contribute to creating a positive environment'. Your version separates these ideas into 'This training can help...' and 'This will create a good place to work', breaking the direct causal link present in the source text.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the full concept of 'positive reinforcement' in addition to 'recognition'. Rephrase to better capture the meaning of 'people-oriented'.

The primary failure is the inability to preserve the core meaning and fidelity of the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.62 is significantly below the required 0.75. The BERTScore of 0.8985 is also below the 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of meaning and key vocabulary.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6227 is unacceptable. The original text is a formal recommendation based on findings. Your version, 'Our information shows that Girox Foods should change,' simplifies this to a basic statement, losing the professional context of a recommendation.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8985 is below the minimum of 0.90. This is caused by oversimplifying key terms. 'People-oriented management style' became 'focus on people' and 'positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'praise workers'. This loses lexical fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification was caused by complex sentence structures.\n\n- Structural Error: The sentence 'Our information shows that Girox Foods should change' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\n- Structural Error: The sentence 'We should offer work hours that can change' uses a relative clause ('that can change'), which is a B1 structure.\n\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 structures. Split complex sentences into simple A2 sentences. Rephrase the opening to better reflect a 'recommendation'. Example for the first sentence: 'We have new information. We recommend that Girox Foods should change.' Example for the relative clause: 'We should offer different work hours. Workers can choose their hours.'",
