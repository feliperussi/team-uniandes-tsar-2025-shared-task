Workers can choose when they work. We should also let workers work from places they choose. Managers need to give workers difficult tasks. These tasks help them learn and grow. They should praise workers for their good work. They should show that the company values their work. We should spend more money to help workers develop their skills. This helps them talk with other people. It also helps them talk with people from other countries. This will create a good place to work. Then, workers can do their best work.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7046 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the original text's professional nuance. Concepts like 'positive reinforcement' and 'intercultural communication' were oversimplified into 'praise workers' and 'talk with people', weakening the core message.\n\nAdditionally, the text fails the vocabulary audit.\n- The word 'management' is B1 level. It is not permitted at A2.\n- The word 'flexible' is B2 level. It is not permitted at A2.\n- The text uses the A2 word 'recommend', which is acceptable, but the overall simplification is not sufficient to compensate for the B-level vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to avoid the B1 word 'management'. Use a simpler phrase like 'a new way for bosses to lead'. Remove the B2 word 'flexible'. The subsequent sentence 'Workers can choose when they work' already explains the concept sufficiently. The text must be rewritten to restore the professional meaning using only A1/A2 vocabulary.",
