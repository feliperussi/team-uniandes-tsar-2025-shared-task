    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6386 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n*   Deviation: The original states humans are 'more likely' to give food. Your version, 'people give food more', changes the meaning from probability to quantity or frequency. This is a critical semantic shift.\n*   Deviation: The original uses the word 'beg'. Your version, 'ask for food many times', weakens the meaning and adds information ('many times') that was not in the source text. This is an embellishment that corrupts the original message.\n*   Deviation: While the vocabulary is correctly at the A2 level and the BERTScore is acceptable, the changes made have damaged the factual meaning of the first paragraph.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the first paragraph to restore the original meaning. Change 'give food more' back to a concept like 'it is easier to get food'. Remove the invented detail 'many times'. The goal is simplification without altering the core facts or reasons.",
