The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8999 falling below the 0.90 minimum.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Loss: The original text states dogs 'have learnt that humans are more likely to give food'. Your version, 'They have learned something important. People often give food', disconnects the learning from the action and weakens the core concept of the dogs' strategy.\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is too low. The replacement of specific terms like 'metro system' with 'trains' and 'passengers' with 'people' contributed to this failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'cute' is present in the text. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below. This is a non-negotiable rule.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. The dogs' learning process must be the central point.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and logical connections of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text was over-simplified into a series of short, disconnected sentences. This destroyed the cause-and-effect relationships present in the original. For example, the original states passengers are 'so used to the sight... that they travel largely unnoticed'. Your version, 'people on the trains see these dogs often. It is normal for them. So, people don't really notice...', weakens this direct causal link, which is a major loss of meaning.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: Nuance was lost. The original specifies humans are 'more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs'. Your version, 'people give food to small dogs', removes the comparative and descriptive elements, altering the original statement.\n\n- Structural Flaw: While the sentences are simple, their choppiness prevents the text from flowing logically. The constant use of new lines for each short sentence is stylistically poor and contributes to the disjointed feel.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine some sentences to restore logical flow. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'because'. Example: Instead of 'There is one idea. The dogs can smell very well.', write 'One idea is that the dogs can smell very well and remember the smells of their favourite places.' This is still A2 level but preserves the connection between ideas.",

Your replacement, 'ask for food', is too weak and loses this critical nuance.\n- Connotation Loss: The word 'territory' implies an area the dogs control. Your replacement, 'area', is too general and loses this meaning.\n- Intensity Reduction: 'Excellent sense of smell' was reduced to 'can smell very well'. This is a loss of intensity.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate every word choice. Ensure that simplifications do not remove important nuances. Restore the comparative meaning of 'more likely'. Find an A2-level phrase that captures the desperation of 'beg', for example, 'ask for food many times'. Retain the concept of 'territory' by rephrasing, for example, 'the area where they live and control'.",
