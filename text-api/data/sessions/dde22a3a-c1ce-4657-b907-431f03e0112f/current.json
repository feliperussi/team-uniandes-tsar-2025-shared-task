    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to show the people they did something wrong. This is because they did not follow the rules in the past. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area by lottery. A lottery means they choose the names by chance. The children are 12 to 18 years old. The chosen children are called 'tributes'. Tributes are the children who must fight. They must fight in a big fight, and only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on TV.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. All B1-level vocabulary ('punish', 'battle') was successfully replaced with A2-level equivalents ('did something wrong', 'fight'). Complex sentence structures were broken down into simple, declarative sentences. The key term 'tributes' was introduced and immediately defined in simple terms, as was the concept of a 'lottery'. Factual accuracy is perfect. No violations of the A2 standard were detected.",
