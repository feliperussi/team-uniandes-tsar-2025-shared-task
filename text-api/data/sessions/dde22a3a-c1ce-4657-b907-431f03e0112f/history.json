The sentence 'The government uses the games to punish the people from different areas' is unacceptable. Replace 'punish' with an A2-level explanation, such as '...to show the people they did something wrong'. The definition of 'lottery' uses a passive voice ('are picked'), which is borderline for A2, but the use of B1 vocabulary is an immediate failure."

All B1-level vocabulary ('punish', 'battle') was successfully replaced with A2-level equivalents ('did something wrong', 'fight'). Complex sentence structures were broken down into simple, declarative sentences. The key term 'tributes' was introduced and immediately defined in simple terms, as was the concept of a 'lottery'. Factual accuracy is perfect. No violations of the A2 standard were detected."
