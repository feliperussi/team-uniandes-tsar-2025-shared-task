This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and nuance during simplification.\n\n*   **Meaning Dilution:** The original text establishes a specific contrast: Springsteen's continued success versus 'many other best-selling album artists'. Your output, 'Many artists are different from Bruce Springsteen,' is a generic and weak statement that loses the crucial context that he is being compared to other highly successful peers.\n*   **Loss of Personal Connection:** The original states Springsteen 'tells us our most fundamental stories about ourselves'. This is a personal and profound statement. Your version, 'He tells the most important stories about people,' is impersonal and generic. It completely removes the key idea that his music resonates because it is about the listener's own experience.\n*   **Quantitative Evidence:** The low MeaningBERT score is not a subjective opinion; it is quantitative proof that the over-simplification has damaged the central message of the source text.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the opening to clarify the comparison is with other *successful* artists. Revise the sentence about stories to re-introduce the personal connection to 'us' and 'ourselves'."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and tone during simplification.\n\n*   **Meaning Dilution:** The original text uses strong, specific language like \"most fundamental stories\" and \"at the top of his game.\" Your output weakens these concepts significantly.\n    *   Evidence: \"fundamental stories\" (implying core, essential truths) was reduced to \"important stories.\" This loses the original's emphasis on the deep, universal nature of the music.\n    *   Evidence: The idiom \"at the top of his game\" (meaning performing at the absolute peak of one's ability) was reduced to \"very good at his job.\" This is a generic and much weaker statement, failing to convey the high level of excellence described in the source text.\n*   **Structural Compliance:** While the text correctly adheres to A2 sentence structures and vocabulary, this adherence came at the cost of the original message's intensity and nuance. The goal is simplification, not evisceration of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: You must find A2-level phrasing that better preserves the original's strong tone. Do not simply replace complex words with the most common, weaker synonym. Rephrase to capture the *concept*.\n*   To fix \"fundamental stories,\" use a phrase like: \"He tells stories about the most important parts of people's lives.\"\n*   To fix \"at the top of his game,\" use a phrase like: \"He is still one of the best at what he does.\""
