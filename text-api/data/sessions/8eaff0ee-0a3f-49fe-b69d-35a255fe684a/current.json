    "text_translated": "Many other very successful singers stop making popular music. But Bruce Springsteen is different. He is almost 70 years old, but he still makes new music. His music is very popular. He plays in big stadiums and they are full. He is still one of the best at what he does. This does not surprise me. He tells stories about the most important parts of people's lives. When you listen to his album 'Born in the USA', those stories are important for us today, just like they were in the past.",
