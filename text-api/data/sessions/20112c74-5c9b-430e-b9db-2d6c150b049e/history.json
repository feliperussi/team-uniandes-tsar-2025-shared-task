The text loses the nuanced meaning of 'influence' and 'genetics' from the original. The BERTScore of 0.9262 is acceptable. The CEFR classifier incorrectly rated this text as B1, which is too complex for the A2 target. This is a secondary failure, as the primary failure is meaning preservation. - The original phrase 'influence of genetics on brain and language development' was simplified to 'how they help our brain and language grow'. 'Help' is a less precise term than 'influence' and does not fully capture the scope of genetic impact. - The original phrase 'how much influence genes have on language' was simplified to 'how much genes change language'. 'Change' is a direct action, whereas 'influence' implies a broader, potentially indirect, or contributing role. This simplification alters the core message about the nature of genetic impact. - The term 'genetics' in the original, which refers to the study of heredity and variation, was simplified to 'genes', which are specific units of heredity. This narrows the scope of the original inquiry. - The CEFR classifier incorrectly identified the text as B1. While the vocabulary is largely A2, the sentence structure, particularly the use of multiple short, declarative sentences in sequence, creates a choppy rhythm that is not typical of natural A2 flow. For example, 'Researchers found a gene change. This change happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This change seems linked to speaking.' This sequence, while simple, is not fluid. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to accurately reflect the concept of 'influence' and 'genetics' rather than 'help' or 'change'. Ensure the complexity of the relationship is maintained at an A2 level without oversimplification of the core concept. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'but' to improve flow without increasing complexity.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7248 is below the required 0.75. The text loses some of the specific scientific meaning from the original. Deviation 1: The term 'mutated' was simplified to 'change'. While 'change' is simpler, 'mutated' carries a specific biological meaning of a permanent alteration in DNA, which is lost. Deviation 2: 'Language ability' was simplified to 'ability to speak'. Language encompasses more than just speaking (e.g., understanding, reading, writing), and this simplification narrows the original meaning. Deviation 3: 'Influence' and 'connection with' were simplified to 'affect'. While 'affect' is an A2 word, 'influence' and 'connection with' can imply a more nuanced or complex relationship that is not fully captured by the simpler term. Deviation 4: CEFR Compliance Failure. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This indicates the text is still too complex for the target level. Deviation 5: Vocabulary Deviation. The word 'gene' is used multiple times (e.g., 'about genes', 'some genes change', 'a gene change'). 'Gene' is classified as a B2 word and is not appropriate for an A2 text without simplification or a very simple definition. The text defines 'DNA' but not 'gene', which is a core concept. Suggestion: To improve meaning preservation, retain more specific scientific terms or provide very simple A2-level explanations for them. For CEFR compliance, simplify sentence structures further if needed. Crucially, replace or define B2 vocabulary like 'gene' with A2-appropriate language. For example, 'gene' could be explained as 'a small part in our body that tells it what to do'.",

The keyword 'DNA' was provided for definition but was used in the text ('in our DNA') without any accompanying A2-level explanation or simplification. For A2, complex scientific terms must either be replaced with simpler language or clearly defined in A2 terms within the text itself.

The original text focuses on a specific scientific inquiry into a causal relationship. Your version, 'We want to know about small parts in our body. These parts make us who we are. How are they linked to our brain and language?', is a much broader and less specific statement of general curiosity, failing to convey the scientific context and the precise nature of the 'influence'.n- Lexical Specificity: The specific scientific terms 'genetics' and 'gene mutation' are replaced with the overly generalized 'small parts in our body' and 'big change'. While an attempt at simplification, this dilutes the precise scientific meaning and the specific biological mechanism being discussed, contributing to the low MeaningBERT score. The original's emphasis on a 'gene mutation' is not adequately conveyed by 'big change'.n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. The sentence 'DNA is the special code inside our body that holds all our information' uses a relative clause ('that holds all our information'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. A2 texts should primarily use simple sentences or coordinate clauses with 'and', 'but', 'so', 'because'.n- CEFR Compliance: The structure 'It is too early to say how much these small parts are linked to language' contains an embedded question ('how much these small parts are linked to language'), which is also characteristic of B1 complexity.nnSuggestion: To improve, ensure that the specific scientific concepts, even when simplified, retain their core meaning and context. Rephrase sentences to use only A2 grammatical structures, avoiding relative clauses and embedded questions. For example, 'DNA is a special code. It is inside our body. It holds all our information.' Reintroduce the concept of 'influence' and 'mutation' in A2-appropriate terms, rather than overly generalizing them.",

They want to know how these tiny parts help our brain and language grow.\nDid some of these tiny parts change? Did this change give us language?\nScientists found a change in these tiny parts. This change happened 200,000 to 100,000 years ago. This change seems linked to speaking. It also helps our brain control our mouth and face.\nMonkeys have similar tiny parts. But their tiny parts did not change.\nWe do not know how much these tiny parts affect language yet. But one day, we might find answers in our DNA. DNA is information in our body.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5973 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message. The simplification of 'genetics' to 'special tiny parts in our body. These parts tell our body what to do' is overly simplistic and fails to convey the scientific concept of inherited characteristics or the study of heredity. The original text discusses the 'influence of genetics on brain and language development,' implying a deeper scientific inquiry into how inherited traits affect development. Your version reduces this to a basic functional description of genes, losing the nuance of 'influence' and the broader scientific context. The text also fails to capture the idea of 'genes that mutated and gave us language ability' with the same clarity, instead asking 'Did some of these tiny parts change? Did this change give us language?' which is less direct. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to more accurately reflect the scientific inquiry into the impact or role of inherited information (genes) on brain and language development. Ensure the simplified explanation of 'genetics' conveys the idea of inherited information or characteristics, not just a generic function.",
