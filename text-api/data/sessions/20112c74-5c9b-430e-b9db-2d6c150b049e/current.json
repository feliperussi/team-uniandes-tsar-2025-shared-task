    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5973 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message. The simplification of 'genetics' to 'special tiny parts in our body. These parts tell our body what to do' is overly simplistic and fails to convey the scientific concept of inherited characteristics or the study of heredity. The original text discusses the 'influence of genetics on brain and language development,' implying a deeper scientific inquiry into how inherited traits affect development. Your version reduces this to a basic functional description of genes, losing the nuance of 'influence' and the broader scientific context. The text also fails to capture the idea of 'genes that mutated and gave us language ability' with the same clarity, instead asking 'Did some of these tiny parts change? Did this change give us language?' which is less direct. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to more accurately reflect the scientific inquiry into the impact or role of inherited information (genes) on brain and language development. Ensure the simplified explanation of 'genetics' conveys the idea of inherited information or characteristics, not just a generic function.",
