    "text_translated": "Some people believe that writing down your dreams can open your mind to lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams are a type of dream where you know you are dreaming, and you can also make choices to change what happens in them. So, you could change a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you could direct the plot of your dream like a film director. This means you would create your dreams instead of just trying to understand their meaning. However, you may still want some dreams that can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. While the vocabulary used is generally appropriate for B1, the sentence structures remain somewhat complex for the target audience. For example, the sentence 'However, you may still want some dreams that can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind' is long and contains an embedded relative clause ('that can let...') which, combined with the abstract concept of 'mind's deeper part', pushes the overall complexity towards B2. To achieve a B1 level, consider breaking down longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones. For instance, the example sentence could be split into two: 'However, you may still want some dreams. These dreams can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind.' Additionally, ensure that the overall flow and sentence variety are maintained while simplifying these structures.",
