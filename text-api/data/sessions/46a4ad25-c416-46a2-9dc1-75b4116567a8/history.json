While the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning, as indicated by the high MeaningBERT (0.8727) and BERTScore (0.9534), the linguistic complexity remains too high for a B1 reader. For instance, the sentence 'This means you would create your dreams, instead of just trying to understand their meaning' uses the complex phrase 'instead of just trying to understand'. Even more significantly, the final sentence, 'However, you may still want some dreams which allow your mind's deeper part to tell you what is on your mind', is quite long and features a relative clause ('which allow...') combined with a more abstract concept ('mind's deeper part'), pushing its complexity beyond B1. To achieve B1, consider breaking down longer sentences into shorter, more direct statements. For example, the last sentence could be split into two: 'However, you may still want some dreams. These dreams can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind.' Also, simplify complex phrasal structures where possible.",

While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.86, BERTScore: 0.95), the overall linguistic complexity is too low for a B1 target. For example, the original text's final complex sentence, 'Then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind!', was broken into four very short, simple sentences in the output: 'This means you would create your dreams. You would not just try to understand their meaning. However, you may still want some dreams. These dreams can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind.' This strategy, while clear, significantly reduces the sentence complexity and overall text flow to an A2 level. To achieve B1, consider combining some of these shorter sentences using B1-level conjunctions (e.g., 'while', 'although', 'whereas') or relative clauses, and varying sentence structures. For instance, the last two sentences could be combined: 'However, you may still want some dreams that can let your mind's deeper part tell you what is on your mind.' This would introduce a relative clause and increase complexity without sacrificing clarity.",
