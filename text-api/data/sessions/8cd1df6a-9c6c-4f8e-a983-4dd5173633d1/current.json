The factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8395 and BERTScore of 0.9282 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The vocabulary used is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with no unapproved B1 or B2 words detected. Sentence structures are short, simple, and appropriate for the A2 level, utilizing basic connectors like 'But' and 'Also' effectively. This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
