The factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8395) and BERTScore (0.9282) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms appropriate vocabulary and simplified sentence structures. Complex grammatical constructions from the original, such as 'While' clauses, 'who' clauses, and 'that' clauses, have been effectively broken down into short, simple sentences using A2-level connectors like 'But' and 'Also'. Vocabulary has been consistently simplified to A1/A2 equivalents (e.g., 'develop' to 'change', 'neighbourhood' to 'area', 'legitimate' to 'real').",
