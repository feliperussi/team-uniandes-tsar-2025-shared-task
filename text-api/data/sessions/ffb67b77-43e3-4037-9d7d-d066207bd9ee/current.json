    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' target. The primary reason for this is the final sentence: 'Although there are about 50 more to record, NASA says that none of the 887 it knows about are a serious danger to the planet.' The use of the B2-level connector 'Although' to start a complex sentence with multiple clauses pushed the text into a higher complexity band. To correct this, split the sentence into two simpler ideas. For example: 'There are about 50 more to record. However, NASA says that none of the 887 it knows about are a serious danger to the planet.' While the text successfully passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks with high scores, failing to meet the target CEFR level is a critical error.",
