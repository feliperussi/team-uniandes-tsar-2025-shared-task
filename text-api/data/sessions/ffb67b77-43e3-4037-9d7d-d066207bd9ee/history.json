This failure occurred despite the text passing the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks. The B2 classification is likely due to the use of long sentences with multiple, embedded relative clauses. For example, the sentence 'These are called 'near-Earth objects', or NEOs, which are objects the size of mountains that travel within 50 million kilometres of our planet's path' is structurally too advanced for B1. To correct this, split complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones. Suggestion: 'These are called 'near-Earth objects', or NEOs. They are the size of mountains and travel within 50 million kilometres of our planet's path.'

The primary reason for this is the syntactic complexity of the final sentence: 'Although there are about 50 more to record, NASA says that none of the 887 it knows about are a serious danger to the planet.' This single sentence combines a subordinate clause (Although...), reported speech (NASA says that...), and a relative clause (...it knows about), which is a structure more typical of the B2 level. Suggestion: Split this sentence into two to meet the B1 target. For example: 'There are about 50 more to record.

While the text successfully preserves factual integrity and meaning, the simplification was too aggressive. This is primarily due to the use of very short, simple sentences and the replacement of nearly all higher-level vocabulary with A1/A2 alternatives. For example, the sequence 'These are called 'near-Earth objects', or NEOs. They are the size of mountains...' creates a choppy, elementary flow. To achieve a B1 level, combine some of the shorter sentences to create more complex structures and improve fluency. Suggestion: Rephrase to 'These 'near-Earth objects' (NEOs) are the size of mountains and travel within 50 million kilometres of our planet's path.'
