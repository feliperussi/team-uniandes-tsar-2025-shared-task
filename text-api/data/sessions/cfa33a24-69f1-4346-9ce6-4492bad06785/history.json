This indicates a loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n- The primary cause of the low score is the oversimplification of specific concepts. The original's phrase 'resistant to movement' was replaced with 'very strong' and 'does not move a lot'. While simple, this loses the specific meaning of resistance.\n- Key vocabulary like 'design' was replaced with the more general 'build', and 'earthquake zones' became 'places with earthquakes'. This contributes to the lexical divergence from the source.\nSuggestion: Revise the final sentences to more closely reflect the original meaning. Instead of 'They build them on ground that is very strong', use a phrase like 'They build bridges on ground that does not move easily in an earthquake'. This restores fidelity while remaining at an A2 level.",

This indicates an unacceptable deviation from the source text's wording.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The introduction of a new sentence, 'An earthquake is when the ground shakes a lot,' is the main cause of the fidelity failure. This sentence has no basis in the original text. While it defines a keyword, it adds information rather than simplifying existing information, thus reducing the lexical overlap and failing the BERTScore metric.\n- Secondary Deviation: The replacement of the specific B1 noun 'structures' with the generic A1 word 'things' contributes to the loss of fidelity. This oversimplification removes important meaning from the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Adhere strictly to the content of the original text. Do not add new sentences or definitions that are not derived from the source. Simplify the original's vocabulary without losing key concepts; for example, 'structures' could be simplified to 'buildings' if context allows, but not to the overly vague term 'things'.",
