The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n- Factual Integrity: The core message of the original text is preserved with 100% accuracy.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text is correctly classified as A2. All metrics are well within the required thresholds, with a BERTScore of 0.9182 and a MeaningBERT score of 0.7953.\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. Complex terms like 'infrequent' and 'resistant to movement' were correctly simplified to 'not very often' and 'stronger ground'.\n- Sentence Structure: The use of short, simple sentences is perfectly executed for the A2 level. The text is clear and easy to understand.\n- No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
