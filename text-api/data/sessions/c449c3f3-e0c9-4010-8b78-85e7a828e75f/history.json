The MeaningBERT score of 0.632 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message and emphasis of the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8786 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. The output's structure and content deviate too much from the original's intent. Specific deviations include: The original text immediately establishes bridges as 'biggest and most expensive transportation projects' and 'crucial links' that are subject to 'intense scrutiny' due to their importance and potential to 'collapse'. Your version breaks this into disconnected sentences, starting with a generic definition of a bridge and then defining civil engineering, which shifts the focus away from the original's core message about the significance and vulnerability of bridges as major projects. Lexical fidelity is also compromised. For example, 'transportation projects in the world' is not present. 'Crucial links' is simplified to 'very important ways', losing the specific nuance. 'Bodies of water' is reduced to 'water'. 'Mountain gorges' is rephrased as 'deep valleys in mountains'. 'Intense scrutiny' is replaced by 'People watch them very carefully'. 'Collapse' is changed to 'falls down'. The addition of a definition for 'civil engineering' at the beginning, while potentially helpful for A2, was not the primary focus of the original paragraph and contributes to the divergence from the original's core message and lexical content. Suggestion: Re-evaluate the overall structure to maintain the original's flow and emphasis on the importance and scrutiny of bridges as major projects. Ensure more direct lexical matches for key phrases to improve BERTScore. Focus on simplifying the original sentences rather than reordering and adding new definitions that were not the primary focus.",

While the text is simplified for A2, it sacrifices too much lexical detail from the source. Specific examples of this lexical loss include the simplification of 'transportation projects' to 'projects for moving people and things', 'mountain gorges' to 'deep valleys in mountains', 'intense scrutiny' to 'people watch bridges very carefully', and 'collapse' to 'falls down'. These changes, while aiming for A2, collectively reduced the fidelity score below the acceptable threshold. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, indicating appropriate grammatical and structural simplification for the target level, but this does not compensate for the loss of lexical fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original lexical detail while maintaining A2 simplicity. For instance, consider 'big projects for moving things' instead of just 'biggest projects' to keep 'transportation' implied. Use A2 equivalents that are lexically closer to the original terms, such as 'deep, narrow valleys' for 'gorges' or 'people watch them very closely' for 'intense scrutiny'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7127 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8956 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation in key vocabulary and phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below. \n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text highlights 'most expensive transportation projects' and 'crucial links'. Your version simplifies 'most expensive' to 'cost a lot of money' and omits 'transportation' from the initial description, diluting the original context. 'Crucial links' is softened to 'very important links', losing the emphasis on absolute necessity. The concept of 'intense scrutiny' is also softened to 'watch bridges very closely', which misses the formal and rigorous examination implied by the original. \n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low due to multiple lexical substitutions and omissions. For example, 'transportation projects' was not fully retained, 'most expensive' was simplified, 'crucial' was replaced by 'very important', 'aspects' by 'part', and 'intense scrutiny' by 'watch bridges very closely'. These changes, while aiming for simplicity, resulted in a loss of specific vocabulary and phrasing from the original text. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to retain the 'transportation' context. Use stronger A2-level synonyms for 'crucial' if 'very important' is too weak. Ensure the concept of 'intense scrutiny' is conveyed with more precision, perhaps by stating 'people check bridges very carefully' or 'experts look at bridges very closely'.",
