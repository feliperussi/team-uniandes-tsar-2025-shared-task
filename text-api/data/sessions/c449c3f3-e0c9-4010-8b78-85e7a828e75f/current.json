    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability requirements. Factual integrity is maintained. MeaningBERT score of 0.8464 and BERTScore of 0.9025 both exceed the minimum thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A2 level or simpler, with complex terms like 'mountain gorges', 'civil engineering', 'intense scrutiny', and 'collapse' effectively simplified to 'deep, narrow valleys in mountains', 'the work of building things', 'check bridges very carefully', and 'falls down' respectively. Sentence structures are short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate words like 'and', 'so', and 'when'. This is a well-executed A2 simplification.",
