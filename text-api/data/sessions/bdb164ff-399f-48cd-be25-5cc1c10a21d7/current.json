    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6473 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text uses strong concepts like 'come under fire with accusations' and 'consumer backlash'. Your version simplifies these to 'did many bad things' and 'customers are very angry'. This oversimplification loses the intensity and the specific meaning of public criticism and organized opposition, causing the metric failure.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8986 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key phrases from the original, such as 'major supermarket chains' and 'excessive plastic waste', with less precise A2 equivalents.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'used', which is classified as B1 level. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of public criticism. Rephrase 'did many bad things' to something like 'people said the supermarkets were doing things that were wrong'. Remove the B1 word 'used'. The sentence 'They also used too much plastic packaging' must be rewritten. Use an A2 alternative like 'They put their food in too much plastic packaging'.",
