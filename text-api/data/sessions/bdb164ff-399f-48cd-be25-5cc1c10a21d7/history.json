The core idea of a public and forceful response to corporate wrongdoing is lost.\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: Key terms from the original text such as 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', and 'pact' have been completely removed. While simplification is necessary for A2, the complete removal of these concepts without adequate A2-level replacement caused the fidelity score to drop.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning using A2 vocabulary. Instead of 'did bad things', consider 'did things that were not right or fair'. The connection between people being angry and the supermarkets changing must be clearer. The word 'promise' is an acceptable simplification of 'pact', but its impact is weakened by the other simplifications.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text describes supermarkets facing 'accusations of unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash'. Your version simplifies this to 'did things that were not right or fair' and 'people are very angry'. This simplification is too extreme; it loses the critical concepts of public accusation and organized consumer pressure, which are central to the original meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8942 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing key lexical items like 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', and 'signed up to a pact' with overly generic phrases.\n\n- Vocabulary Compliance Error: The B1-level word 'waste' is used in the final paragraph ('plastic waste'). You correctly used the A2 alternative 'rubbish' earlier. This inconsistency is an error. A2 texts must not use B1 vocabulary when a suitable A2 alternative exists.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to better capture the original's meaning. Restore the concept of public criticism and formal agreements. The phrase 'did things that were not right or fair' is too weak. Rephrase to show that people publicly accused the supermarkets. Replace the B1 word 'waste' with 'rubbish' in all instances.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8981 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key phrasing. The original text uses strong concepts like 'come under fire', 'accusations', and 'consumer backlash'. Your version weakens these to 'people said' and 'customers are complaining'. This simplification loses the original meaning of serious, public criticism and pressure. The original states supermarkets 'signed up to a pact', which is a formal agreement. Your version, 'made an important promise', is less formal and loses the sense of a binding commitment. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Do not dilute strong concepts. The text must convey the intensity of the criticism and the formality of the agreement. For example, use phrases that show anger or strong disagreement, not just simple statements.",
