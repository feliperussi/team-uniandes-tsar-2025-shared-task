        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text demonstrates excellent simplification of sentence structure and complex ideas. However, it fails due to a single vocabulary error. The word 'protect' is B1 level. A strict A2 text cannot contain B1 vocabulary, even if the meaning is clear. An alternative such as 'keep us safe' or 'stop the danger' would have been compliant. This single error makes the entire text a failure."

Complex concepts like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and 'predictions about possible impact' are simplified effectively ('If they fly near Earth...' and 'It can see if an asteroid is going to hit Earth'). The text is factually identical to the original. No violations were found."
