    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some of these rocks can be dangerous to Earth. If they fly near Earth, we call them 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). 'Near' means less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them is a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to follow these objects. It can see if an asteroid is going to hit Earth. If an asteroid becomes a danger, NASA has two ways to keep us safe.",

    "feedback": "The text is approved. It is a flawless example of A2 writing. Sentence structure is simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1-A2 range. Complex concepts like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and 'predictions about possible impact' are simplified effectively ('If they fly near Earth...' and 'It can see if an asteroid is going to hit Earth'). The text is factually identical to the original. No violations were found.",
