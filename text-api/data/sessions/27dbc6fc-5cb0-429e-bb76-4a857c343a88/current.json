    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained throughout the text. The MeaningBERT (0.8578) and BERTScore (0.9158) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is excellent. The decision to define the keyword 'stereotypes' within the text is a model of best practice, making the concept accessible to the target audience. Furthermore, complex sentences from the original were skillfully broken down into shorter, clearer sentences, improving readability without creating a choppy flow. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'pigeonhole' with 'label... in the same way', are both accurate and appropriate for the B1 level. No improvements are necessary.",
