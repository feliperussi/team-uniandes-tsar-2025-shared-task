        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' target. The failure is due to overly complex sentence structures, not vocabulary. For example, the sentence 'However, it is also very important to remember that cultural stereotypes, which are simple but often untrue ideas about a group of people, can be bad for building good business relationships' uses a non-defining relative clause that is too advanced for B1. Suggestion: Break this into two separate sentences. First, state the main point about stereotypes and business relationships. Second, define what stereotypes are. Similarly, the sentence beginning with 'Although' should be split to reduce complexity and meet the B1 standard.",

The MeaningBERT (0.8578) and BERTScore (0.9158) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is excellent. The decision to define the keyword 'stereotypes' within the text is a model of best practice, making the concept accessible to the target audience. Furthermore, complex sentences from the original were skillfully broken down into shorter, clearer sentences, improving readability without creating a choppy flow. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'pigeonhole' with 'label... in the same way', are both accurate and appropriate for the B1 level. No improvements are necessary.",
