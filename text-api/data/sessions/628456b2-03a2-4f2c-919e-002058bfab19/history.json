This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of key concepts. The original text specifies the 'global average number of babies per woman has declined'. Your version simplifies this to 'a woman had about six babies. Now, a woman has about two babies.' This changes a statement about a global statistical trend into a simple comparison for an individual, which is a significant factual and conceptual alteration.\n- The concept of a 'decline' is lost. You present a 'before' and 'now' state without capturing the process of reduction over time.\n- The BERTScore of 0.9001 is borderline, indicating that while some keywords were kept, the overall phrasing and fidelity are at the absolute minimum acceptable level.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the lost concepts.
