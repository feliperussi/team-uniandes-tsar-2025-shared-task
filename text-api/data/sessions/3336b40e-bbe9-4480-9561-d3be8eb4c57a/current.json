This can happen because bad quality materials were used when the bridge was built, or because there was a problem with an important part of the bridge. However, in other situations, the bridge was only designed to hold a certain amount of weight, and it could not hold more.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained; no information was altered or lost from the original text. Meaning preservation is strong, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7819, well above the 0.75 threshold. The core message about reasons for bridge collapses is fully retained. Fidelity to the original content is also high, with a BERTScore of 0.9479, exceeding the 0.90 requirement. Key concepts and information are accurately reflected. The simplified text is correctly classified as B1 CEFR compliant, meeting the target level. The vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'realise' with 'understand' and 'inferior-quality material' with 'bad quality materials', effectively lower the linguistic complexity without losing meaning. Sentence structures are appropriately simplified, for example, 'conduct a complete investigation' becoming 'do a complete study', which is more accessible for a B1 learner. The use of connectors like 'However, in other situations' ensures good flow and coherence at the B1 level. Overall, this is a highly effective simplification that achieves its goals with precision and clarity.",
