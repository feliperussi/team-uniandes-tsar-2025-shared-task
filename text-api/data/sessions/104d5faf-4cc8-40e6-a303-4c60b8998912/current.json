    "text_translated": "Wasfia Nazreen first saw a hula hoop when she was a young girl in her home country, Bangladesh, as she watched a child from another country playing with one. Wasfia did not want to just watch, but she stood by sadly, because in her country, people believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of only a few people in the world who have climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on each of these mountains. Her reason for doing this was to empower women and girls in a country that discourages them from doing sport.",

    "feedback": "The writer's output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original text and the simplified version. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7557 and BERTScore of 0.964 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the text was accurately classified as B1 by the CEFR classifier, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The simplification strategy of splitting the longer third sentence into two shorter ones (Now, Wasfia is one of only a few people in the world who have climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on each of these mountains.) is effective and enhances readability for a B1 audience. The use of B1 connectors like 'but', 'because', and 'also' contributes to a smooth flow. For future improvements, consider providing a brief, simple definition or explanation for 'Seven Summits' as it was listed as a keyword for definition, which could further aid a B1 reader's comprehension. Additionally, while the CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, the word 'empower' is classified as C1. Although its use here does not push the overall text beyond B1, exploring a simpler alternative like 'give strength to' or 'help women and girls feel strong' could make the text even more accessible without losing the core message.",
