She watched, but she couldn't join, because in her country, people thought that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of only a few people in the world who have climbed the Seven Summits. These are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents, including Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on each of these mountains. She did this because she wants to help women and girls feel strong in her country, where people tell them not to do sport.",

Specifically, the output softens the emotional and societal implications present in the original. For example, 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched' in the original conveys a stronger sense of personal feeling and societal pressure than the output's 'She watched, but she couldn't join.' Similarly, the original's 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' is a more active and impactful statement than the output's 'to help women and girls feel strong in her country, where people tell them not to do sport.' While the output simplifies the language, it dilutes the strength of the message regarding the systemic discouragement and Wasfia's powerful motivation. To improve, consider retaining stronger verbs and more evocative phrasing that captures the original's emotional and societal context, while still adhering to B1 complexity. For instance, instead of 'couldn't join,' consider 'felt sad she couldn't join,' or for 'people tell them not to do sport,' try 'a country that stops them from doing sport' to better convey the original's meaning.",

The original text states 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched', which conveys an internal conflict or resistance to the societal norm, implying she did not want to comply but felt compelled to. The simplified output, 'Wasfia watched sadly, but she could not join in', while accurately describing her inability to participate and her negative emotion, slightly softens the emphasis on her reluctance or internal struggle against the imposed restriction. To improve meaning preservation, consider phrasing that more directly captures the 'reluctance' or internal conflict, for example, 'Wasfia did not want to stand by, but she watched sadly' or 'Wasfia wished she could join, but she had to watch'.",

While the core narrative of Wasfia Nazreen's achievements and motivations is largely preserved, the addition of the explanatory phrase 'which are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents' for 'Seven Summits' introduces new information not explicitly present in the original text's core message. Although this clarification is beneficial for simplification, MeaningBERT may interpret this expansion as a slight deviation from the original's precise semantic focus, contributing to the lower score. To improve, ensure that any added explanations are tightly integrated and do not shift the primary semantic emphasis of the original sentences. The goal is to simplify the existing meaning, not to add new explanatory details that might alter the original's core semantic footprint.",

        "feedback_text": "The writer's output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original text and the simplified version. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7557 and BERTScore of 0.964 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the text was accurately classified as B1 by the CEFR classifier, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The simplification strategy of splitting the longer third sentence into two shorter ones (Now, Wasfia is one of only a few people in the world who have climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on each of these mountains.) is effective and enhances readability for a B1 audience. The use of B1 connectors like 'but', 'because', and 'also' contributes to a smooth flow. For future improvements, consider providing a brief, simple definition or explanation for 'Seven Summits' as it was listed as a keyword for definition, which could further aid a B1 reader's comprehension. Additionally, while the CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, the word 'empower' is classified as C1. Although its use here does not push the overall text beyond B1, exploring a simpler alternative like 'give strength to' or 'help women and girls feel strong' could make the text even more accessible without losing the core message.",
