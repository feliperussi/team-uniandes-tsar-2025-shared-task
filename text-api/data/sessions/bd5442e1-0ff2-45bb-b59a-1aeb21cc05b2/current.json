They must show workers that their work is important. We should spend more money on training. This training helps workers improve their jobs. It helps them with social skills. It helps them talk with people from other countries. This makes a good place to work. Workers can do their best work there.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, as indicated by the low metric scores. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6056 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's depth. The BERTScore of 0.8823 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The strategic nuance of 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is lost by simplifying it to 'manage people in a way that helps them'. This reduces a management philosophy to a general helpful action. 2. Meaning Preservation Failure: The specific management concepts of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' are diluted to 'praise workers. They must show workers that their work is important'. This loses the precise meaning of the original recommendation. 3. Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms like 'employees' were consistently replaced with 'workers', and 'Managers' with 'Bosses'. While simpler, these replacements reduce the lexical precision and fidelity to the original text. 4. Lexical Fidelity Failure: 'Professional development' was replaced with 'training helps workers improve their jobs', and 'intercultural communication' with 'talk with people from other countries'. These are less precise and lose the specific terminology of the original. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the strategic implications of the original management recommendations. Use A2 vocabulary that maintains closer lexical and conceptual fidelity to the original terms, even when simplifying. For example, find A2 ways to express 'people-oriented management style' or 'positive reinforcement' without losing their core meaning.",
