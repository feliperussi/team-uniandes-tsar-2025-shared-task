For example, 'challenge our staff' became 'give workers different tasks', and 'positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'give more praise. They must say \"good job\"'.

The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, but the content preservation is inadequate. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.617 is significantly below the required 0.75.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, falling below the required thresholds for both MeaningBERT and BERTScore. This is a critical failure at Priority 2 of the diagnostic protocol. 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7204 is below the required 0.75. The nuanced meaning of the original text, particularly the emphasis on 'On the basis of these findings' and the active 'could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work', is diluted. The simplified phrases 'We looked at information' and 'This makes a good place to work. Workers can do their best work.' lose the original's specific rationale and the active contribution aspect. 2. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8983 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. For example, 'On the basis of these findings' was replaced with 'We looked at information'. 'explore ways of offering more flexible working hours' was simplified to 'find ways to give workers flexible hours'. 'enable employees to work from their chosen locations' became 'Workers can choose where they work'. 'Increased investment in professional development' was reduced to 'spend more money on professional development'. These lexical deviations are too significant for the required fidelity. 3. CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not the target A2. This is primarily due to the presence of vocabulary above the A2 level. Words such as 'management' (B1), 'challenge' (B1), 'development' (B1), 'communication' (B1), 'flexible' (B2), 'recognition' (B2), and 'intercultural' (B2/C1) are used without simplification or definition, making the text inaccessible for an A2 learner. The term 'reinforcement' is also above A2. 4. Vocabulary Audit Failure: Numerous words are above the A2 standard. For instance, 'people-oriented management style' contains 'management' (B1). 'flexible hours' uses 'flexible' (B2). 'challenge workers' uses 'challenge' (B1). 'positive reinforcement' contains 'reinforcement' (B2/C1). 'recognition for their work' uses 'recognition' (B2). 'professional development' contains 'development' (B1). 'intercultural communication' contains 'intercultural' (B2/C1) and 'communication' (B1). These must be replaced with simpler A2 equivalents or defined in A2 terms. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore the specific meaning and active voice of the original. Replace all B1/B2/C1 vocabulary with A2 equivalents or provide A2 definitions. Ensure the lexical overlap with the original is higher to meet BERTScore requirements.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6198 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's nuance and impact. The BERTScore of 0.8871 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key lexical items and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below:  - Meaning Preservation Failure: The original's recommendation for a 'more people-oriented management style' is diluted to 'management style. This style cares about people. This style helps workers.' This loses the specific emphasis on 'more' and the directness of 'people-oriented'.  - Meaning Preservation Failure: The concept of 'challenge our staff' is weakened to 'give workers different tasks. These tasks help workers learn and grow.' This loses the proactive and developmental aspect of 'challenging'.  - Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms like 'professional development' were replaced with the more generic 'training', reducing lexical overlap.  - Lexical Fidelity Failure: The specific phrase 'social and intercultural communication' was broken down into 'talk well with other people. It helps them talk well with people from different countries', which, while simpler, significantly reduces lexical similarity and precision.  - Lexical Fidelity Failure: 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' was simplified to 'praise workers. They must show they value workers' good work', losing some of the original's specific terminology.  Suggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the strength and specific recommendations of the original. Ensure that A2 vocabulary is used to directly translate key concepts like 'people-oriented management style' and 'challenge our staff' without losing their core meaning or impact. Focus on retaining more of the original's specific terminology where appropriate, using A2 synonyms or simple phrases that are lexically closer to the original, to improve both meaning and lexical fidelity.",

This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the A2 simplification task. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6177 is significantly below the required 0.75. The simplification lost critical nuance and specific concepts from the original. For example, 'positive reinforcement' is a specific management technique, not merely 'praise workers for good work'. 'Professional development' is a broader concept than just 'training to learn new things for their jobs'. The core message's depth was not preserved.\n2.  Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8986 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical items and factual phrasing from the original were not adequately retained. Terms like 'positive reinforcement and recognition' and 'intercultural communication' were replaced with overly general or descriptive phrases, leading to a loss of lexical precision.\n3.  CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This means the linguistic complexity is still too high for the target audience.\n    *   The sentence 'They must also show they see and value the work workers do' contains multiple embedded clauses and omitted 'that' clauses ('show [that] they see', 'the work [that] workers do'), which are characteristic of B1 structures.\n    *   The phrase 'how workers can choose where they work' uses 'how' and 'where' as conjunctions for dependent clauses, which increases complexity beyond A2.\n4.  Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'management' (in 'management style') is a B1 word. For A2, this should be simplified to 'how bosses work' or 'how leaders lead'.\n5.  Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'challenge' (in 'tasks that challenge them') is a B1 word. For A2, this should be simplified to 'tasks that are hard for them' or 'tasks that make them think'.\n6.  Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'value' (in 'value the work workers do') is a B1 word. For A2, this should be simplified to 'think the work is important' or 'see the good in the work'.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Re-evaluate the core meaning of the original text to ensure all key concepts, even if simplified, are fully represented. Do not dilute the message.\n*   Focus on retaining more specific vocabulary where possible, or ensure that replacements are exact in meaning, not just general.\n*   Break down complex sentences with embedded clauses. Avoid omitted 'that' clauses. Rephrase 'how' and 'where' dependent clauses into simpler, separate sentences or A2-level structures.\n*   Replace all B1 vocabulary with A2 equivalents. For example, 'management' to 'how bosses work', 'challenge' to 'give hard tasks', 'value' to 'think is important'.",

Your output failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5709 is significantly below the required 0.75. Your simplification has diluted the strategic intent and nuance of the original recommendations. For example, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' was reduced to 'need a way for bosses to work that helps people', which loses the specific concept of a 'management style'.\n*   Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8707 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Terms like 'flexible working hours', 'positive reinforcement and recognition', and 'professional development' were replaced with overly simplified or broken-down phrases, losing important lexical detail.\n*   CEFR Compliance: The CEFR classifier rated your output as A1, not A2. This oversimplification directly contributed to the loss of meaning and fidelity, as the text became too basic to convey the original message effectively at an A2 level.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Increase lexical fidelity: Retain more key terms from the original text where appropriate, or find closer A2 synonyms. Do not break down complex but essential concepts into overly simplistic phrases if it dilutes the meaning.\n*   Preserve strategic intent: Ensure the overall purpose and strategic nature of the recommendations are maintained, not just a list of basic actions.\n*   Adjust complexity to A2: Review the A1 classification. While simplification is necessary, ensure the language is robust enough to convey the A2 level of detail and meaning without resorting to B1 structures.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, as indicated by the low metric scores. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6056 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's depth. The BERTScore of 0.8823 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The strategic nuance of 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is lost by simplifying it to 'manage people in a way that helps them'. This reduces a management philosophy to a general helpful action. 2. Meaning Preservation Failure: The specific management concepts of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' are diluted to 'praise workers. They must show workers that their work is important'. This loses the precise meaning of the original recommendation. 3. Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms like 'employees' were consistently replaced with 'workers', and 'Managers' with 'Bosses'. While simpler, these replacements reduce the lexical precision and fidelity to the original text. 4. Lexical Fidelity Failure: 'Professional development' was replaced with 'training helps workers improve their jobs', and 'intercultural communication' with 'talk with people from other countries'. These are less precise and lose the specific terminology of the original. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the strategic implications of the original management recommendations. Use A2 vocabulary that maintains closer lexical and conceptual fidelity to the original terms, even when simplifying. For example, find A2 ways to express 'people-oriented management style' or 'positive reinforcement' without losing their core meaning.",
