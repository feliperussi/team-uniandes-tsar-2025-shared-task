        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the length and complexity of several sentences, which combine multiple clauses, making them challenging for a B1 reader. For example, the sentence 'To do this, we should find ways to offer our employees more flexible working hours, and we should also think about how we can allow them to work from their chosen locations' is quite long and contains multiple ideas. Additionally, some vocabulary, such as 'flexible' (identified as B2 in the candidate list) and the phrase 'intercultural communication', contributes to the higher classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider breaking down longer sentences into two or more simpler ones and replacing any remaining B2 vocabulary with more common B1 alternatives.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent factual integrity and meaning preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8886 and BERTScore of 0.939 are well above the required thresholds, indicating that the core message and key information from the original text have been accurately retained. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, confirming its appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is highly effective. The original text's longer sentences have been appropriately split into shorter, more manageable units, improving readability without making the text choppy. For example, the original sentence 'As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations' was effectively split into two B1-appropriate sentences. Vocabulary simplification was also well-executed. Terms like 'professional development' were successfully replaced with 'training,' 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with 'positive feedback and show they value,' and 'increased investment' with 'spending more money.' These changes effectively lower the lexical complexity to a B1 level while maintaining the original meaning. The use of B1 connectors like 'Because of these findings' and 'To do this' further enhances the flow and coherence of the simplified text. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
