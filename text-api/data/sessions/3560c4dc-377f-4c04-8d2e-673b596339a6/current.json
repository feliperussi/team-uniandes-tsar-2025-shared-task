    "text_translated": "Genes are parts of our body that we get from our parents. They decide things like our hair color. We have more questions about how genes affect our brain and language. Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be linked to speaking. It is also linked to how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But the monkey gene did not change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. But one day we might find the answers in our genes.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. The key term 'genes' is defined clearly and simply at the beginning. Sentence structures are consistently simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. The simplification of complex concepts like 'mutation' to 'change' and 'language ability' to 'power to speak' is executed flawlessly.",
