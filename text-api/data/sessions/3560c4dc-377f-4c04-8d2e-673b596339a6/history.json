Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be linked to speaking. It is also linked to how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But the monkey gene did not change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA. DNA is the material in our bodies that has our genes.",

The rules state that introducing complex terms, even with an explanation, is a failure. The goal is to use vocabulary the A2 learner already knows, not to teach new terms beyond the approved list. While the simplification of other concepts and the sentence structure are adequate, this violation of the core vocabulary rule is non-negotiable."

Sentence structures are consistently simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. The simplification of complex concepts like 'mutation' to 'change' and 'language ability' to 'power to speak' is executed flawlessly."
