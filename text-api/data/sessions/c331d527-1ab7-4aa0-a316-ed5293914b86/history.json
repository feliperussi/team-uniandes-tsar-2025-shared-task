For example, describing the rockets' function across three separate sentences makes the concept easier to follow. The primary area for improvement is the handling of contextual information. The original text specifies that HAMMER is a 'genuine NASA proposal'. The simplified output, 'The plan is called HAMMER,' loses the important context that this is a real plan from a major space agency. This detail adds credibility and is a key piece of information. Suggestion for improvement: To retain this context while maintaining simplicity, consider a phrasing like 'NASA has a real plan for this. It is called HAMMER.'
