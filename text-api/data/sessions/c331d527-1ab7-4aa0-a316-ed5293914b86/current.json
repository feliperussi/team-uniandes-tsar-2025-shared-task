It was the subject of the 1998 movie *Armageddon*. The plan is called HAMMER. It would use eight\u2011ton rockets. The rockets would be aimed at the asteroid that is coming toward Earth. The rockets would try to push the asteroid off its path. If the asteroid is too close for this to work, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to destroy it.",

    "feedback": "This output is a strong simplification and successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the metrics for meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.94) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.92) are well above the required thresholds. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The strategy of breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones is effective. For example, describing the rockets' function across three separate sentences makes the concept easier to follow. The primary area for improvement is the handling of contextual information. The original text specifies that HAMMER is a 'genuine NASA proposal'. The simplified output, 'The plan is called HAMMER,' loses the important context that this is a real plan from a major space agency. This detail adds credibility and is a key piece of information. Suggestion for improvement: To retain this context while maintaining simplicity, consider a phrasing like 'NASA has a real plan for this. It is called HAMMER.' This preserves the key fact of NASA's involvement without using complex language. Overall, this is a very good submission that could be made excellent by retaining slightly more key context.",
