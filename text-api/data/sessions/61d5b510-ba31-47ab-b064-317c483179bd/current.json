    "text_translated": "In the last 200 years, technology and health have improved. As a result, fewer children died when they were young. This caused the world's population to grow very quickly. Large families had more children who grew up and had their own families. However, things changed in the 1960s. Contraception, which is a way to prevent pregnancy, became easier to get. Because of this, the average number of babies for each woman has gone down. It has dropped from six to only two.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. The structure and flow are very strong; you have used a good mix of simple and more complex sentences. Your use of connectors like 'As a result', 'who', and 'Because of this' links ideas logically and creates a coherent paragraph. The sentence 'Contraception, which is a way to prevent pregnancy, became easier to get' is a perfect demonstration of the B1 ability to define a term using a relative clause. The vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level, and the text is factually accurate, correctly summarizing all key points from the original.",
