        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. The structure and flow are very strong; you have used a good mix of simple and more complex sentences. Your use of connectors like 'As a result', 'who', and 'Because of this' links ideas logically and creates a coherent paragraph. The sentence 'Contraception, which is a way to prevent pregnancy, became easier to get' is a perfect demonstration of the B1 ability to define a term using a relative clause. The vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level, and the text is factually accurate, correctly summarizing all key points from the original."
