    "feedback": "The writer\u2019s output faithfully preserves all factual details of the original and remains at the correct B1 level. The two sentences maintain the meaning of \u2018coincidence\u2019 as \u2018by chance\u2019 and \u2018prophecy\u2019 as \u2018predict the future;\u2019 the high MeaningBERT (0.81) and BERTScore (0.955) confirm strong fidelity. The sentence structure is clear and accessible, though you might reinsert the phrase \u201cfor example\u201d after the first clause to echo the original\u2019s nuance. Consider briefly defining \u2018coincidence\u2019 and \u2018prophecy\u2019 in a sidebar or glossary for learners unfamiliar with these terms. Otherwise, the text is concise, fluent, and well\u2010suited to B1 learners.",
