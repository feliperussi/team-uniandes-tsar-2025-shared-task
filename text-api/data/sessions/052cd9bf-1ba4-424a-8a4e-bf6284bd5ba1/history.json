After discussing it with my boss, we agreed to reduce my schedule to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a significant cut in my pay, because my salary is based on the number of days I work. However, I have noticed since then that my amount of work has not gone down at all. I am now doing five days' worth of work in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it.",

The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The standout feature of this submission is the excellent strategy used for complex vocabulary. The term 'pro-rata basis' was not just replaced, but skillfully explained with the clause 'because my salary is based on the number of days I work'. This demonstrates a deep understanding of simplification principles. Other choices, such as changing 'negotiating' to 'discussing' and 'workload' to 'amount of work', were also highly effective. The final text is clear, accurate, and perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
