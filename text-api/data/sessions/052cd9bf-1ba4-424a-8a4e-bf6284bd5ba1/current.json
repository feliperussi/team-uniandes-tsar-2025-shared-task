    "text_translated": "I used to work a typical five-day week, but after I returned from leave for my children, I decided that I wanted to spend more time with them before they start school. After discussing it with my boss, we agreed to reduce my schedule to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a significant cut in my pay, because my salary is based on the number of days I work. However, I have noticed since then that my amount of work has not gone down at all. I am now doing five days' worth of work in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained throughout the text. The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The standout feature of this submission is the excellent conceptual simplification of the C1-level phrase 'pro-rata basis' into the clear, B1-appropriate explanation 'my salary is based on the number of days I work'. This demonstrates a superior understanding of simplification principles. Other vocabulary choices, such as changing 'workload' to 'amount of work', are also highly effective. The final text is fluent, clear, and perfectly suited for the target audience.",
