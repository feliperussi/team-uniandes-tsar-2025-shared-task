While the output successfully preserves the original meaning and facts (MeaningBERT: 0.95, BERTScore: 0.94), it fails the primary simplification goal. The C1 classification is likely due to the use of advanced vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, words like 'humanities', 'reinforced', 'genius', and 'stereotypes' are typically above the B1 level. Furthermore, sentences like 'They also present scientists as geeky, having poor social skills, or working alone and detached from the rest of the world' use a complex list structure that is difficult for a B1 reader. Suggestion: To reach the B1 target, replace advanced vocabulary with simpler alternatives (e.g., 'genius' -> 'very smart') and break down complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones.",

The metrics confirm the high quality of the output, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.88 and a BERTScore of 0.93, both well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and key terms. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is particularly effective; complex concepts were rephrased into clear, accessible language. For example, simplifying 'identify with scientists' to 'seeing scientists as people like them' and 'unappealing career path' to 'thinking science is a good career' are exemplary choices for a B1 audience. The sentence structure is clear and the flow is logical. This is a high-quality submission with no major corrections required.",
