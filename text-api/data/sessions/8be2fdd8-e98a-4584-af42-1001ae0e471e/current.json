This idea is made stronger by the lack of female role models in science jobs. Cartoons and stories usually show the crazy scientist, the very smart inventor, or the adventurous astronaut as a man. They also show scientists as geeky, with poor social skills, or working alone and away from other people. These false ideas may stop girls from seeing scientists as people like them and from thinking science is a good career. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, they would feel more confidence and a strong feeling of belonging in those subjects.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The metrics confirm the high quality of the output, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.88 and a BERTScore of 0.93, both well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and key terms. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is particularly effective; complex concepts were rephrased into clear, accessible language. For example, simplifying 'identify with scientists' to 'seeing scientists as people like them' and 'unappealing career path' to 'thinking science is a good career' are exemplary choices for a B1 audience. The sentence structure is clear and the flow is logical. This is a high-quality submission with no major corrections required.",
