The original text emphasizes that brains did not 'suddenly' get bigger, implying an abrupt change, yet humans became more complex. Your version states 'did not grow fast', which changes the nuance from an abrupt change to a lack of speed over time, subtly altering the core message of the paradox. The use of 'But' instead of 'yet' also weakens the contrast intended in the original.\n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is due to several linguistic deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'civilisation' is a B1-level word. It was listed as a keyword for definition but was used directly without simplification or an A2-level explanation. For A2, this concept must be rephrased using simpler terms, such as 'people living together in big groups' or 'early ways of life'.\n- Sentence Structure: The first sentence, 'From 100,000 to 50,000 years before now, people found signs of first civilisation,' is too long and complex for a consistent A2 level. The initial temporal phrase is extended, and the concept of 'signs of first civilisation' adds to the cognitive load. A2 sentences should be shorter and more direct.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about brain growth to accurately reflect the 'suddenly' aspect. Simplify or define 'civilisation' using only A1/A2 vocabulary. Split the first sentence into two or more shorter, simpler sentences.",

The core message and nuance of the original text have been significantly altered. The fidelity of the content, as measured by MeaningBERT, is unacceptable. Specific deviations include: The original text states 'we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation'. Your version rephrases this as 'people started to live in an organised way. This was the start of human society with rules and culture.' This shifts the focus from observing 'evidence' to directly stating 'they started to live', which changes the original's emphasis on archaeological discovery. The phrase 'humans did become more complex and more intelligent' from the original is simplified to 'humans became more clever. Their thinking also became not simple.' While 'not simple' is an A2 simplification for 'complex', the combination loses the directness and full scope of 'complex and more intelligent'. The original's 'caused their brains to develop' is rephrased as 'make their brains change and get better'. 'Develop' is a more precise term than 'change and get better' in this context, and the simplification dilutes the scientific nuance. Similarly, 'start producing language' is simplified to 'start to use language'. 'Producing' implies creation or generation, which is a stronger concept than simply 'using' language in the context of brain development. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to maintain the concept of 'evidence' of civilisation, rather than defining civilisation directly. For example, 'we started to see signs of early human society'. Suggestion: Ensure that simplifications of terms like 'complex' and 'intelligent' fully capture the original meaning. Consider 'more advanced' or 'smarter' if appropriate for A2, but ensure the full scope is retained. Suggestion: Use A2 vocabulary that maintains the precision of terms like 'develop' and 'producing' as much as possible, even if simplified. For 'develop', consider 'grow' or 'become stronger'. For 'producing', consider 'making' or 'creating'.",
