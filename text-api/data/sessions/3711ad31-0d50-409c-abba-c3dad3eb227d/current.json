    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6751 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The core message and nuance of the original text have been significantly altered. The fidelity of the content, as measured by MeaningBERT, is unacceptable. Specific deviations include: The original text states 'we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation'. Your version rephrases this as 'people started to live in an organised way. This was the start of human society with rules and culture.' This shifts the focus from observing 'evidence' to directly stating 'they started to live', which changes the original's emphasis on archaeological discovery. The phrase 'humans did become more complex and more intelligent' from the original is simplified to 'humans became more clever. Their thinking also became not simple.' While 'not simple' is an A2 simplification for 'complex', the combination loses the directness and full scope of 'complex and more intelligent'. The original's 'caused their brains to develop' is rephrased as 'make their brains change and get better'. 'Develop' is a more precise term than 'change and get better' in this context, and the simplification dilutes the scientific nuance. Similarly, 'start producing language' is simplified to 'start to use language'. 'Producing' implies creation or generation, which is a stronger concept than simply 'using' language in the context of brain development. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to maintain the concept of 'evidence' of civilisation, rather than defining civilisation directly. For example, 'we started to see signs of early human society'. Suggestion: Ensure that simplifications of terms like 'complex' and 'intelligent' fully capture the original meaning. Consider 'more advanced' or 'smarter' if appropriate for A2, but ensure the full scope is retained. Suggestion: Use A2 vocabulary that maintains the precision of terms like 'develop' and 'producing' as much as possible, even if simplified. For 'develop', consider 'grow' or 'become stronger'. For 'producing', consider 'making' or 'creating'.",
