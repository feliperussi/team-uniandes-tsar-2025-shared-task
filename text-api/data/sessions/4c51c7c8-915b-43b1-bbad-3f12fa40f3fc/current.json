    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. The primary reason for this classification is the complex sentence structure of the final sentence: 'Because a 19-metre asteroid, which exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013, injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.' This sentence combines a causal clause, a non-defining relative clause, and a conditional clause, creating a level of grammatical complexity that is too advanced for a consistent B1 reader. To achieve B1 compliance, this sentence should be broken down into two or three simpler sentences. For example, you could separate the information about the Chelyabinsk asteroid into its own sentence before explaining the danger of larger asteroids.",
