While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning, the linguistic choices consistently lowered the complexity below the B1 threshold. For example, the original phrase 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' (a B2-level participle clause) was simplified to 'This means that 17,000 of them are still not found', which uses simpler vocabulary ('unaccounted for' to 'not found') and a more basic sentence structure (A2). Similarly, 'Considering that a 19-metre asteroid...' (a B2/C1 introductory clause) was changed to 'We should remember that a 19-metre asteroid...' (A2/B1). The vocabulary choice of 'hurt' instead of 'injured' and 'come into Earth's path' instead of 'enter Earth's orbit' also contributes to the A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to incorporate more B1-level vocabulary and grammatical structures, such as more varied sentence connectors beyond 'So', and potentially retain some of the original's more complex but still B1-appropriate phrasing.",

The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that is too simple. For example, the phrase 'large space rocks' was used to define 'asteroids', and 'People think there are' was used instead of 'estimated'. While these are accurate simplifications, they lean heavily towards A1/A2 vocabulary. Additionally, the original text's complex final sentence was broken down into very short, simple sentences like 'A 19-metre asteroid exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013. It injured 1,200 people.' This strategy, while clear, reduces the overall linguistic complexity below the B1 target. To achieve B1, the writer should aim for slightly more sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate, perhaps retaining some B1-level original terms if they are not explicitly defined as keywords, and vary sentence structure to include more complex B1 conjunctions or relative clauses without oversimplifying to multiple short, simple sentences.",

For example, the participial phrases 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' and 'injuring 1,200 people' are more characteristic of B2 writing. Additionally, the discourse marker 'Considering that' at the beginning of the last sentence also contributes to a higher complexity level. To achieve a B1 level, these structures should be simplified. For instance, 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' could be rephrased as 'and 17,000 are still unaccounted for'. Similarly, 'injuring 1,200 people' could become 'and it injured 1,200 people'. The sentence starting with 'Considering that...' could be split or rephrased with a simpler causal connector, such as 'Because a 19-metre asteroid exploded...'. The definition of 'asteroids' was a good addition for clarity, but the sentence containing it could also be split to reduce its overall length and complexity for a B1 reader.",

This is likely due to the use of vocabulary such as 'means' (identified as B2 in the provided candidates) and 'logged'. While 'logged' is used in a clear context, it might be considered slightly above B1 by some classifiers. Additionally, the sentence 'Asteroids are large rocks that travel in space and measure 140 metres wide or more' combines two descriptive clauses, which, while grammatically correct for B1, might contribute to a higher complexity score when combined with other elements.

The primary reason for this classification is the excessive simplification of sentence structures. For example, the original sentence 'Of the 25,000 estimated asteroids of this size, so far about 8,000 have been logged, leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' was broken into three very short, simple sentences: 'Experts think there are about 25,000 of this size. But only about 8,000 have been recorded so far. So, 17,000 are still unknown.' This pattern of splitting complex sentences into multiple simple ones, along with the predominant use of basic connectors like 'But' and 'So', results in a text that lacks the grammatical complexity expected at B1. Additionally, the insertion of an A1-level definition like 'Asteroids are large rocks that travel in space' further lowers the overall CEFR level. To achieve B1, the text should retain or introduce more complex sentence structures, such as relative clauses or subordinate clauses, and utilize a wider range of B1-level connectors (e.g., 'although', 'however', 'therefore', 'due to'). For instance, the original sentence 'Considering that a 19-metre asteroid... injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger...' could be simplified while retaining a B1 structure, perhaps by using 'Because a 19-metre asteroid... injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids could be very dangerous...'",

        "approval": "FAIL",
        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. The primary reason for this classification is the complex sentence structure of the final sentence: 'Because a 19-metre asteroid, which exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013, injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.' This sentence combines a causal clause, a non-defining relative clause, and a conditional clause, creating a level of grammatical complexity that is too advanced for a consistent B1 reader. To achieve B1 compliance, this sentence should be broken down into two or three simpler sentences. For example, you could separate the information about the Chelyabinsk asteroid into its own sentence before explaining the danger of larger asteroids.",
