    "text_translated": "Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, the first signs of early human life started to appear, for example in cave paintings. However, no one knows the connection between this and language. At that time, human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but people became more intelligent and their lives became more complex. This raises an important question: did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start to produce language?",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text passes the preliminary metrics check and demonstrates strong communicative competence. **Structure and Flow:** You have successfully used a mix of sentence types, including a well-formed compound sentence ('...did not suddenly get bigger, but people became more intelligent...'). The use of connectors like 'However' and 'but' creates a logical and easy-to-follow paragraph. **Vocabulary and Accuracy:** The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level, and you have accurately paraphrased the original text without losing any key information. Framing the final sentence as 'This raises an important question:' is a particularly effective way to introduce the central dilemma.",
