The text passes the preliminary metrics check and demonstrates strong communicative competence. **Structure and Flow:** You have successfully used a mix of sentence types, including a well-formed compound sentence ('...did not suddenly get bigger, but people became more intelligent...'). The use of connectors like 'However' and 'but' creates a logical and easy-to-follow paragraph. **Vocabulary and Accuracy:** The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level, and you have accurately paraphrased the original text without losing any key information. Framing the final sentence as 'This raises an important question:' is a particularly effective way to introduce the central dilemma."
