The linguistic profile is a perfect match for the target level.\nQualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The replacement of 'typical' with 'normal' and 'affectionate/intelligent' with 'friendly/smart' is correct. Sentence structures are simple, using appropriate A2 connectors like 'but' and 'if'. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",
