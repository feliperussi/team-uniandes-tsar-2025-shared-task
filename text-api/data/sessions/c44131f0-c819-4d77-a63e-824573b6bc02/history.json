The classifier rated the output as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the final sentence: 'In a scary film it is nearly sure that at a crucial moment, just when the main character really needs to call for help, there will be no signal at all, or the phone\u2019s power will run out while the call is being made, or both.' This sentence is too long and structurally complex for a B1 level, containing multiple clauses and conditions. Additionally, the use of the B2 vocabulary word 'crucial' contributes to the higher classification. Suggestion: Break the final sentence into two or three shorter sentences to improve readability and compliance. For example: 'At a key moment, just when the main character needs help, there will be no signal. Or the phone's power will run out during the call.' Also, replace 'crucial' with a B1 alternative like 'key' or 'important'.",

This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text. The score was likely lowered by the cumulative effect of replacing several words, such as 'protagonists' with 'main characters', 'believable' with 'realistic', and 'coverage' with 'signal'. While these changes aid simplification, they moved the text too far from the original's wording.\n\nAdditionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check. The output was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely because of two factors: the use of the B2-level word 'desperate' and the complex passive voice structure in the phrase 'while the call is being made'.\n\nTo improve, please revise the text to meet the B1 level. Suggestion: Replace 'desperate situations' with 'very difficult situations'. Rephrase the final sentence to use an active voice, for example: 'Or the phone\u2019s power will run out while the character is making the call'.",

The output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, but it is too linguistically complex for the target audience. The B2 classification is likely caused by two main factors. First, the B2-level vocabulary word 'coverage' was retained. A simpler alternative like 'signal' or 'reception' would be more appropriate for B1. Second, the sentence 'If you are a hero in a horror film, it is almost certain that at a key moment, just when you really need to call for help, you will have no coverage at all' is too long and structurally complex. To meet the B1 requirement, this sentence should be broken into two or more shorter sentences, for example: 'If you are a hero in a horror film, something will probably go wrong. At a key moment, when you need to call for help, you will have no signal at all.'",
