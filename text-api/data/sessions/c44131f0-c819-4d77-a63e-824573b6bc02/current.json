    "text_translated": "Older horror films often show protagonists in very difficult situations, and it is hard or impossible for them to call for help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a little less believable now. What is the solution to keep the suspense? No phone signal! If you are a hero in a horror film, something will probably go wrong. At a key moment, when you need to call for help, you will have no signal at all. Or the phone\u2019s battery will die while the character is making the call, or both.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The submission successfully passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually consistent with the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.9362 and BERTScore of 0.9574 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key details have been preserved with high fidelity. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification is very effective. The writer made excellent vocabulary choices, such as changing 'maintain' to 'keep' and 'coverage' to 'signal'. The structure is clear and easy to follow. For future improvement, consider simplifying 'protagonists' to 'main characters' to further align with B1 vocabulary, although its use here is acceptable.",
