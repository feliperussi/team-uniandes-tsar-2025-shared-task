The film 'Armageddon' in 1998 was about this.\nBut it is a real plan from NASA. It is called HAMMER. HAMMER means 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'.\nHAMMER uses big rockets. These rockets are very heavy, eight tons. NASA can fire these rockets at a PHA. The PHA is coming near Earth.\nThey hope to hit it to change its way. This moves it away from Earth.\nBut if the PHA is too close to Earth, this plan will not work.\nThen, the rockets will carry very strong bombs. These bombs will blow up the PHA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Vocabulary Deviation. The text contains words above the A2 CEFR level, which is a direct violation of the A2 readability standard. The rule states: 'Any unapproved B1/B2 word is a failure.'\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   The word 'Emergency' is present in the text as part of the definition of HAMMER ('Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'). This word is classified as B1 in the provided vocabulary list.\n*   The word 'Mission' is present in the text as part of the definition of HAMMER ('Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'). This word is classified as B2 in the provided vocabulary list.\n\nSuggestion: While the full name of HAMMER is provided, the inclusion of B1 and B2 words within this definition makes the text non-compliant. For A2 level, such complex terms should either be simplified, omitted, or the acronym should be used without providing the full, complex definition. Rephrase the explanation of HAMMER to avoid using words above A2 level.",
