The BERTScore of 0.8876 is also below the required 0.90, showing a loss of key lexical details. Deviations detected: - MeaningBERT Score: The original text presents blowing up the asteroid as 'another suggested defence' and a secondary option if bumping it off course fails. Your version introduces the 'explode' option very early without this crucial context, altering the emphasis and sequence of the plans. - BERTScore: Key phrases and specific vocabulary from the original text were not adequately preserved. For example, 'another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth' was overly simplified, losing the nuance of it being one of several options and the specific threat of being 'on course'. The specific term 'nuclear weapon' was replaced with 'very strong bomb', which, while an A2 simplification, contributes to the lower lexical fidelity score. Corrective Path: - Rephrase the introduction to clearly state that blowing up the asteroid is one of several defence strategies, or a last resort, as presented in the original text. - Ensure that the primary method of 'bumping it off course' is introduced before the 'blowing it up' method, maintaining the original sequence and emphasis. - While simplifying for A2, retain more of the original's specific phrasing where possible without increasing complexity. For instance, 'on course to hit Earth' could be simplified to 'coming to hit Earth' rather than just 'It can hit Earth' to maintain more fidelity.",

It appears in 'NASA has ideas to defend Earth from PHAs.' This must be replaced with an A2 equivalent such as 'protect' or 'keep safe'.\n2. The words 'nuclear weapon' are B1. They appear in 'One idea is to blow up a PHA with a nuclear weapon.' The concept of 'nuclear weapon' must be rephrased using only A2 vocabulary.\n3. The word 'emergency' is a B1 word. It appears in 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'. While this is a proper name, its direct inclusion without further A2 simplification of the name itself contributes to the B1 classification. The full name must be avoided or explained using only A2 words.\n4. The word 'explode' is a B1 word. It appears in 'These bombs will make the PHA explode.' This must be replaced with an A2 equivalent such as 'break into many pieces' or 'burst'.\n5. The word 'mission' is a B2 word. It appears in 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'. This contributes to the B1 classification. The full name must be avoided or explained using only A2 words.\n6. The words 'Hypervelocity' and 'Mitigation' are C1+ words. They appear in 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response'. The direct quotation of these complex terms, even as part of a proper name, violates the A2 readability standard for the entire output.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7044 is below the required 0.75. The original text introduces 'blowing up' as 'another suggested defence' and then details HAMMER as a specific proposal with two distinct methods (bumping or blowing up). Your version reorders this, starting with a general statement about rocks hitting Earth, then presenting 'blowing up' as 'one idea', and later explaining HAMMER's two methods. This shift in emphasis and structure alters the core message about the nature of the defence and HAMMER's dual approach. The BERTScore of 0.8849 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical information was lost or overly simplified. For example, the specific term 'nuclear weapon' was simplified to 'very big bomb' twice. While 'weapon' might be above A2, the adjective 'nuclear' is a critical factual detail that was omitted. Additionally, the full name 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response' for HAMMER was completely omitted, which contributes to the lower score. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction. Clearly state that blowing up a PHA is a type of defence, as presented in the original. Present the two methods of HAMMER (bumping and blowing up) as distinct options within the same mission. Maintain the original's logical flow. Suggestion: Retain critical factual descriptors. The word 'nuclear' is a key detail. Find an A2-appropriate way to convey this concept, or acknowledge its omission impacts fidelity. Mention the full name of HAMMER at least once to maintain fidelity.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8986 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a slight loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Detected deviations include: The opening phrase 'Another suggested defence against a PHA on course to hit Earth' was significantly rephrased, losing direct lexical overlap. For example, 'Another suggested defence' is entirely absent. The initial mention of 'using a nuclear weapon' in conjunction with 'blow it up' was separated and recontextualized as a contingency, rather than the primary method of blowing it up as implied in the original. This alters the lexical relationship. Phrases like 'plot from a film' were simplified to 'movie story', and 'bumping it off course' to 'push it off its path', which, while semantically similar, reduce the direct lexical match required for a higher BERTScore. The concluding phrase 'blow it up instead' was rephrased to 'make the PHA break into many pieces', which, while an appropriate A2 simplification, deviates lexically from the original. Additionally, a vocabulary deviation was detected: The word 'nuclear' is classified as B1. An A2 text must strictly adhere to A2 vocabulary. This word should be replaced with simpler A2 terms or rephrased to avoid it. Suggestion: Ensure closer lexical fidelity to the original text where possible, even when simplifying. Retain key nouns and verbs more directly, or ensure their synonyms are very close in the original context, to achieve the required BERTScore. Rephrase sentences to avoid B1 vocabulary like 'nuclear'.",
