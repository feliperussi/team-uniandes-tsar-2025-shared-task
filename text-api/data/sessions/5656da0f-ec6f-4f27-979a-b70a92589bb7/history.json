The primary directive is to simplify without altering facts.\n\n*   **Factual Error:** The original text states the mutation occurred 'between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago'. Your output incorrectly reverses these numbers to 'between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago'. This is an unacceptable error.\n*   **Meaning Preservation Failure:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.7086 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This quantitatively proves a loss of meaning. The original text's tone is one of scientific questioning and uncertainty ('More questions lie in...', 'Are there genes...?'). Your version flattens this nuance into simple declarative statements, losing the core sense of scientific inquiry.\n\nSuggestion: Verify every number and fact against the original text before proceeding. The goal is simplification, not alteration. Rephrase to maintain the original's speculative tone; for example, instead of stating facts, explain what scientists are trying to find out."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and scientific nuance due to over-simplification.\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original text discusses the 'influence of genetics on brain and language development' and a 'connection' between a gene and speaking. Your output reduces this to genes being 'important for speaking'. This loses the precise scientific meaning of correlation and influence.\n*   **Vocabulary Shift:** Replacing 'language ability' with 'the power to speak' is an unacceptable simplification. Language is more than just the physical act of speaking.\n*   **Concept Dilution:** The original's 'how much influence genes have' is changed to 'how important genes are'. These are not the same concept. The first is about the degree of effect, the second is about significance. The nuance is lost.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be re-written. Restore the concepts of 'influence' and 'connection'. Do not replace precise terms like 'language ability' with overly simple phrases. The goal is simplification, not the complete erosion of meaning."

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core nuance. The text also contains secondary violations.\n\n*   **Meaning Preservation Violation:** The original text uses the phrase \"might be found,\" which conveys scientific uncertainty and possibility. Your output changes this to \"we are going to find,\" which implies a definite future discovery. This shift from speculation to prediction is a significant alteration of the original meaning and is unacceptable.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The B1-level noun \"connection\" was used in the sentence \"This gene change seems to have a connection with speaking.\" This word is not on the A2 list and must be simplified. Using the A2 verb \"connect\" is acceptable, but the B1 noun is not.\n*   **Keyword Violation:** The keyword \"gene\" is listed as B2. While you provided a definition, its placement at the very beginning of the text dilutes the original message about scientific inquiry and likely contributed to the low MeaningBERT score by adding introductory content not present in the source.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n1.  **Restore Meaning:** You must rephrase the final sentence to reflect uncertainty. Change \"we are going to find\" to a phrase like \"maybe we will find\" or \"it is possible we will find.\"\n2.  **Eliminate B1 Vocabulary:** Remove the word \"connection.\" Rephrase the sentence.

The qualitative audit confirms its suitability.\n\n- **Factual Accuracy:** The output is factually identical to the original text. All numbers and core concepts were transferred without error.\n- **CEFR Compliance:** The text correctly classified as A2. The consistent use of short, simple sentences (e.g., \"They found a change in one gene. This change happened a long time ago.\") is exemplary for this level.\n- **Vocabulary Control:** The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. The single B2 keyword, \"gene,\" was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms (\"A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work.\"), which is the required protocol.\n- **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.7392 is acceptable, though marginally below the ideal target of 0.75. This indicates a very slight loss of nuance, likely from simplifying \"language ability\" to \"the skill for language,\" but the core message is fully preserved. This is a minor observation, not a failure."
