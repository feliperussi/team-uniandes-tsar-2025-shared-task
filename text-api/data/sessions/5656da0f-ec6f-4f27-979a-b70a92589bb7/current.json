    "text_translated": "Scientists have more questions about how genes affect our brain and our language. A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. Scientists ask if some genes changed and gave us the skill for language. They found a change in one gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This gene change seems to be connected with speaking. It is connected to how our brain controls our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change in this way. It is too early to know how much genes affect language. But maybe one day we will find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "The output meets the A2 standard. It has passed all primary checks for factual accuracy, meaning preservation, and CEFR classification. The qualitative audit confirms its suitability.\n\n- **Factual Accuracy:** The output is factually identical to the original text. All numbers and core concepts were transferred without error.\n- **CEFR Compliance:** The text correctly classified as A2. The consistent use of short, simple sentences (e.g., \"They found a change in one gene. This change happened a long time ago.\") is exemplary for this level.\n- **Vocabulary Control:** The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. The single B2 keyword, \"gene,\" was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms (\"A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work.\"), which is the required protocol.\n- **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.7392 is acceptable, though marginally below the ideal target of 0.75. This indicates a very slight loss of nuance, likely from simplifying \"language ability\" to \"the skill for language,\" but the core message is fully preserved. This is a minor observation, not a failure.",
