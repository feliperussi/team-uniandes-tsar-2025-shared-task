MeaningBERT score is 0.863 (above 0.75) and BERTScore is 0.9213 (above 0.90), indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. Simplifications such as 'a million dollars' to 'a lot of money' and 'disturbing' to 'strange' are appropriate and effective for the target level.\n- Sentence Structure: The text is correctly constructed using a series of short, simple sentences. It avoids complex clauses and connectors beyond the A2 scope. This is a model example of A2 structure.",
