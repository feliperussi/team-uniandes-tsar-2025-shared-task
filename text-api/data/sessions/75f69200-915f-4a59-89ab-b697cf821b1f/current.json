One show was about young people. They tried to win a lot of money. The other shows were news about the war. The two ideas came together in her head. It was a strange idea. This gave her the idea for The Hunger Games.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All key information is preserved.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT score is 0.863 and BERTScore is 0.9213, indicating excellent meaning and lexical preservation. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly controlled, using A1 and A2 words. Complex concepts from the original ('merge', 'disturbing') are correctly simplified to A2 equivalents ('came together', 'strange'). Sentence structure is consistently short and simple, avoiding any B1-level complexity. The output is a perfect execution of the A2 standard.",
