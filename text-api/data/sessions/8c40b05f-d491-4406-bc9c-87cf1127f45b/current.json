    "text_translated": "Unlike many other artists with best-selling albums, Springsteen is still making new music that is very popular and fills stadiums. He is still one of the best musicians, even though he is in his late 60s. This is not surprising because he tells our most important stories about ourselves. When you listen to 'Born in the USA', you find that those stories are still as relevant today as they ever were.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that serves as a model for B1-level writing. The output successfully passed all priority checks, starting with perfect factual integrity. The metrics confirm this high quality, with a MeaningBERT of 0.90 and a BERTScore of 0.94, well above the required thresholds. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The writer's strategy was excellent: two long, complex sentences from the original were skillfully broken down into four shorter, clearer sentences. The use of B1 connectors like 'even though' and 'because' creates a smooth, logical flow. Vocabulary simplification was also outstanding, particularly the replacement of the idiom 'at the top of his game' with the clear phrase 'one of the best musicians'. No improvements are necessary.",
