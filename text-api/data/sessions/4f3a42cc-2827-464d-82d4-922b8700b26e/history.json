        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Vocabulary Violation. The text fails due to the inclusion of a word above the A2 level, which is a critical error.\n\n*   **Primary Failure:** The word 'means' is classified as B2 level. Its use in the sentence 'This also means I get a lot less money' is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n*   **Analysis:** The text successfully passed the Factual Integrity check and the Meaning Preservation check (MeaningBERT: 0.8326). The CEFR classifier also correctly identified the output as A2. However, the qualitative audit reveals this single but decisive vocabulary failure.\n*   **Corrective Path:** The B2 word must be removed. Replace 'means' with a simpler A2 construction. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence to 'So, I get a lot less money' or 'This is why I get a lot less money'."

The text demonstrates a strong command of the A2 level without being overly simplistic (A1) or too complex (B1).\n- **Qualitative Audit:** The text is flawless. Vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Complex B1 concepts like 'negotiating' and 'pro-rata basis' were expertly simplified into A2-compliant phrases ('I talked with my boss', 'I get paid only for the days I work') while maintaining perfect accuracy. Sentence structure is simple, clear, and uses appropriate A2 connectors."
