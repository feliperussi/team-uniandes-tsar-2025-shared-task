    "text_translated": "Before, I worked a normal five-day week. After I had my children, I wanted to spend more time with them before they start school. I talked with my boss. We agreed to make my work week three days long. So, I get a lot less money. I get paid only for the days I work. But now I see that my amount of work is the same. I am doing five days of work in only three days, but I get much less money for it.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification, meeting all protocol requirements without deviation.\n\n- **Factual Integrity:** The output is 100% factually accurate compared to the original text.\n- **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.8235 is excellent, confirming that the core message was fully preserved.\n- **CEFR Compliance:** The A2 classification is correct. The text demonstrates a strong command of the A2 level without being overly simplistic (A1) or too complex (B1).\n- **Qualitative Audit:** The text is flawless. Vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Complex B1 concepts like 'negotiating' and 'pro-rata basis' were expertly simplified into A2-compliant phrases ('I talked with my boss', 'I get paid only for the days I work') while maintaining perfect accuracy. Sentence structure is simple, clear, and uses appropriate A2 connectors.",
