'Empower' means to give power or authority; your text only describes demonstrating a quality. The BERTScore of 0.8996 is also below the 0.90 minimum, reflecting a loss of key phrasing. The original's concept of a country that 'discourages' sport was simplified to 'people say girls should not do sports', which loses the sense of active opposition. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are appropriate for A2, the failure to accurately convey the central idea of the original text is a complete failure of the task.

The text fails to preserve the core message and nuance of the original source material.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Meaning Loss (Primary Failure): The original text states Wasfia's goal is 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your version, 'She wants to give them the power to do what they want,' is too general and loses the specific, crucial context of fighting discouragement from sports.\n- Nuance Loss: The original text highlights the rarity of her achievement by stating she is 'one of the few people in the world' to climb the Seven Summits. Your version, 'Now, Wasfia climbs mountains,' removes this emphasis entirely, diminishing the scale of her accomplishment.\n- Factual Simplification: The original text's emotional detail, 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched,' is reduced to 'Wasfia only watched.' This removes the important nuance of her internal conflict and desire.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Restore the specific meaning. Rephrase the final paragraph to connect her actions directly to sports. Example: 'Wasfia wants to show girls that they can play sports and be strong.'\n- Suggestion: Restore the sense of achievement. The text must communicate that her accomplishment is rare. Example: 'Very few people have climbed these mountains.'\n- Suggestion: While simplifying, do not remove key concepts that define the narrative. The loss of meaning is a critical error.",
