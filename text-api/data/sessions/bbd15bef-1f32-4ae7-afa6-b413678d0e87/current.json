One day, she saw a child from another country. The child was playing with a hula hoop. Wasfia wanted to play, but she could not. In her country, people said girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes.\n\nNow, Wasfia climbs mountains. She climbed the Seven Summits. Very few people in the world have climbed these mountains. They are the highest mountains on the seven continents, like Everest. She played with a hula hoop on the top of each mountain.\n\nShe did this for a reason. In her country, people make it difficult for girls to do sports. Wasfia wants to give women and girls more power and confidence. She wants to show them they can be strong.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6078 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text's core message about 'empowering' women in a country that 'discourages' them was lost. Your version replaced this strong, direct concept with multiple, weaker sentences like 'give women and girls more power and confidence' and 'show them they can be strong'. This separation and oversimplification diluted the original's direct causal link between the action and the reason.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: You introduced the B1-level word 'confidence'. This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard. All words must be strictly A2 or below.\n\n- Fidelity Borderline: The BERTScore of 0.9014 is barely passing the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key phrasing that contributed to the overall meaning degradation.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final paragraph to restore the original's meaning. Focus on the concepts of 'discouragement' and 'empowerment' using A2 vocabulary. Remove the word 'confidence' immediately. A correct A2 phrasing would be: 'In her country, people tell girls not to do sports. Wasfia did this to show that women and girls can be powerful.'",
