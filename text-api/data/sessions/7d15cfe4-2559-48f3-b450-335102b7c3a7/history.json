The combination of a passive reporting structure ('It is thought that...'), a compound sentence using 'but', and the present perfect passive ('have been found') creates a level of grammatical complexity that exceeds the B1 level. Suggestion: Rephrase this sentence using a more direct, active structure. For example: 'Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far.'
