    "text_translated": "Now NASA is working to find and record some of the smaller **asteroids**. Asteroids are large rocks that travel through space. NASA is especially looking for certain asteroids. They are looking for ones that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far. So, 17,000 of them have not been recorded yet. This is a serious issue. In 2013, a much smaller asteroid exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it injured 1,200 people. This is an example of the danger. These middle-sized asteroids will be very dangerous if they enter the area around Earth.",

    "feedback": "Excellent work. This submission passes all checks and serves as a model for B1 simplification. Factual Integrity: All key data points, including the numbers of asteroids (25,000, 8,000, 17,000) and the details of the Chelyabinsk event (19 metres, 2013, 1,200 people), were preserved perfectly. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.9273) scores confirm that the core message and key details were retained effectively. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. Qualitative Strengths: The simplification strategy was outstanding. Breaking down the final complex sentence into several shorter, clearer sentences greatly improved readability. The explicit definition provided for the keyword 'asteroids' is a best practice and highly effective for the target audience. No major improvements are needed.",
