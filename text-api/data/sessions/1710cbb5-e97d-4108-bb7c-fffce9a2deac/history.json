However, adherence to all metrics is non-negotiable. Suggestion: To meet the fidelity requirement, re-evaluate simplifications.

This indicates that key words and phrasing from the original text were lost during simplification, even though the general meaning was preserved. This is a critical failure.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low because multiple phrases were altered, such as 'deeper connection' becoming 'Feeling close to people' and 'regularly' becoming 'often'. While these are valid simplifications, their cumulative effect reduced lexical fidelity below the acceptable minimum.\n- B2 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is B2 level. It was used in the sentence 'Self\u2011disclosure means talking about personal feelings.' This is an unacceptable vocabulary choice for an A2 text.\n- B2 Vocabulary Violation: The compound adjective 'all-important' is B2 level and was retained from the original. It must be simplified.\n- B1/B2 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'ties' is above A2 level. It should have been replaced.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of 'self-disclosure' to avoid the B2 word 'means'. Use an A2 structure like: 'Self-disclosure is when you talk about personal feelings.'\n- Suggestion: Replace 'all-important' with 'very important'.\n- Suggestion: Replace 'strong ties' with an A2 alternative like 'strong connections' or rephrase the sentence to 'happy people are very close to friends and family'.",

Key concepts like 'strong ties' and 'all-important' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same weight, damaging fidelity to the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all B1 vocabulary.
