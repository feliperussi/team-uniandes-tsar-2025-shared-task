    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8899 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates an unacceptable loss of lexical detail from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The score is too low because key phrases were oversimplified. For example, 'strong ties' and 'deeper connection' were removed, which reduced the lexical match with the source.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'friendship' is B1 level. Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard. The original text did not use this word.\n- Keyword Definition: The definition of 'self-disclosure' is adequate.\n\nSuggestion: Replace the B1 word 'friendship' with an A2 phrase like 'this deep connection'. Re-evaluate simplifications to ensure closer lexical fidelity to the original text to meet the BERTScore requirement.",
