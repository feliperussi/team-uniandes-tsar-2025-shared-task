This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, sacrificing factual precision for simplicity.\n\n- Fidelity Degradation: The low score is a direct result of replacing specific, important words from the original text. Terms like 'shipwrecked', 'trapped', 'published', and 'translated' were replaced with overly simple phrases like 'sinks at sea', 'is in a lifeboat', 'came out', and 'is in'. This damages the lexical connection to the source material.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'worldwide' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Replace 'worldwide' with 'all over the world' or 'in many countries'.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1-level word 'diplomat' was used. Providing an explanation is a valid strategy, but avoiding the word entirely is safer for strict A2 compliance. Suggestion: Rephrase to avoid the term, for example: 'Yann Martel\u2019s father worked for his country in other places.'\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is excessively fragmented. The sequence of extremely short, disconnected sentences ('He also lived in Canada. He also lived in France. He also lived in Mexico.') is more characteristic of an A1 text. Suggestion: Combine some sentences using A2-level connectors like 'and' to improve flow. For example: 'As a child, he lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France and Mexico.'",

A secondary failure was detected in fidelity, with a BERTScore of 0.87, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- The primary cause of the meaning preservation failure is the complete omission of key information. The original text states that as a child, Martel \"lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France and Mexico.\" Your output removes this entire fact, which is a significant loss of content.\n- The simplification of the text into a series of short, disconnected sentences has damaged the narrative flow and contributed to the low metric scores.\n- The phrasing \"Yann Martel\u2019s father worked for his country. Yann is his son\" is unnatural and redundant. The second sentence is unnecessary.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-integrate the omitted factual information. The text must state that Martel lived in several countries as a child. Combine some of the overly simplistic sentences to create better, but still simple, connections. For example: \"Pi is a young boy from India whose ship sinks.\" Rephrase the final sentence to be more direct and less redundant, such as: \"His father was a diplomat, so Yann lived in many countries when he was a child.\"",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.71, which is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.88, which is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.71): The text's meaning was diluted by over-simplification. The concept of a 'diplomat' was reduced to 'worked for his country', which is too vague and loses the specific meaning of the original. The extreme fragmentation of sentences also weakened the connections between ideas.\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.88): The text failed to retain key lexical items. Words like 'shipwrecked', 'trapped', 'author', and 'diplomat' were removed, causing a significant drop in fidelity to the source text.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'worldwide' was used. This word is not on the A2 list and must be replaced or simplified.\n- Structural Weakness: The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure, while using simple grammar, makes the text difficult to follow and contributes to the loss of meaning. The sentences 'The book is the third by Yann Martel' and 'The Canadian writer Yann Martel wrote it' are redundant and poorly structured.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Restore the original meaning. The simplification of 'diplomat' is unacceptable. Rephrase to better capture the original concept using A2 vocabulary.\n- Suggestion: Improve sentence structure. Combine some of the short, choppy sentences to create better logical flow. For example, 'His ship sinks and he is stuck in a lifeboat...'\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'worldwide'. Use an A2-compliant phrase such as 'in many countries' or 'all over the world'.",

While simplification is necessary, it must not sacrifice lexical fidelity to this degree.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing key descriptive words. Changing 'extraordinary story' to 'special story' and 'translated into' to 'available in' lost too much of the original's specific meaning.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B1+): The text includes multiple words that are not on the A2 list. This is a critical error. The word 'ferocious' is B2 level. The word 'published' is B1. The word 'shipwrecked' is B1. The word 'diplomat' is C1. These words must be replaced or defined in simple A2 terms.\n- Structural Simplification: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes it read like a list, not a paragraph. While short sentences are good, they must still connect logically.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Replace all words above the A2 level. 'Ferocious' must be changed to 'very dangerous'. 'Diplomat' must be changed to 'a person who works for his country in other countries'. 'Published' must be changed to 'came out'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore fidelity. For example, 'It is available in 41 languages' does not mean the same as 'It has been translated into 41 languages'. A better A2 version is 'People can read the book in 41 different languages'.\n- Suggestion: Combine some of the very short sentences using 'and' or 'but' to improve the flow of the text.",
