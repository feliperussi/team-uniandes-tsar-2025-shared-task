An album is a collection of songs by a musician or a group. An artist is a person who creates music, paintings, or other forms of art. Music means sounds, especially when they are organized in a way that is pleasant to hear. This does not surprise me because Springsteen is a man who tells us important stories about ourselves. Stories are accounts of real or imagined events. When you listen to his album Born in the USA, these stories are still relevant today, which means they are important and connected to our current lives.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7164 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates that the core meaning of the original text is not sufficiently preserved in the output. Specifically, the original emphasizes that Springsteen 'remains at the top of his game,' which implies ongoing high performance and relevance, but the output shifts focus to generic definitions (e.g., defining 'album,' 'artist,' and 'music') that dilute the original message. The insertion of definitions interrupts the narrative flow and lessens the impact of the original's point about Springsteen's enduring significance. To improve, the output should maintain the core message without excessive definitional detours, simplifying language while preserving the original meaning and narrative coherence. Additionally, although the BERTScore (0.9044) meets the threshold, the lower MeaningBERT score primarily reflects loss in preserving the original emphasis and nuance, which should be addressed.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8611) and BERTScore (0.9372) scores exceed the required thresholds, confirming strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classification at B1 is correct. The text maintains sentence variety and connectivity suited to B1 level, effectively using simple connectors and clear structure. Vocabulary substitutions respect the defined candidates, with complex terms like 'album' and 'surprise' retained at appropriate levels, supporting clarity without oversimplification. To improve further, the output could reduce slight redundancy such as the phrase \"meaning they are connected to our current lives and experiences.\" Consider replacing it with a more concise phrase to enhance fluency and naturalness for B1 readers. Overall, the text is clear, accurate, and well-adapted to the target CEFR level.",
