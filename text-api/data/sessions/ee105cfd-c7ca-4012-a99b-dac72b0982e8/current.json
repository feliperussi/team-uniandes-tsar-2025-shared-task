    "text_translated": "Unlike many other artists who sell many albums, Bruce Springsteen is still creating new music that reaches the top of the charts and fills large stadiums, even though he is in his late 60s. This does not surprise me because Springsteen is a man who tells us important stories about ourselves. When you listen to his album Born in the USA, these stories are still relevant today, meaning they are connected to our current lives and experiences.",

    "feedback": "The output passes all primary checks. It preserves factual integrity with no discrepancies between the original and the output. Both MeaningBERT (0.8611) and BERTScore (0.9372) scores exceed the required thresholds, confirming strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classification at B1 is correct. The text maintains sentence variety and connectivity suited to B1 level, effectively using simple connectors and clear structure. Vocabulary substitutions respect the defined candidates, with complex terms like 'album' and 'surprise' retained at appropriate levels, supporting clarity without oversimplification. To improve further, the output could reduce slight redundancy such as the phrase \"meaning they are connected to our current lives and experiences.\" Consider replacing it with a more concise phrase to enhance fluency and naturalness for B1 readers. Overall, the text is clear, accurate, and well-adapted to the target CEFR level.",
