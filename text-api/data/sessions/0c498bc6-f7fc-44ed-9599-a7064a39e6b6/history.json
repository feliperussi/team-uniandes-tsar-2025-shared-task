The original text's core message is about the careful application of cultural knowledge, not just a list of influences. Your version loses this nuance.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8726 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'detrimental to building good business relationships' and 'pigeonhole the individuals' were oversimplified, losing critical lexical detail.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification was likely caused by vocabulary and sentence structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words above the A2 level. B1 words detected: 'cultural', 'aware', 'customs', 'whether', 'label'. B2 words detected: 'being', 'shaped'. These are unacceptable.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'Being aware of possible differences can help us avoid miscommunication' starts with a gerund phrase ('Being aware'). This is a B1 structure. A2 requires simple Subject-Verb-Object sentences.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove all B1 and B2 words immediately. Replace them with A2-level equivalents. Rephrase the sentence 'Being aware...' to start with a simple subject, for example, 'When we know about possible differences...'. The text must be rewritten to more closely match the original's emphasis on how to use, and not misuse, cultural knowledge.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8544, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Core Meaning Lost: The original text's warning that stereotypes are 'detrimental to building good business relationships' was weakened to 'can hurt business'. This loses the specific and serious nature of the warning.\n- Lexical Fidelity Lost: Key concepts like 'increased awareness', 'pigeonhole', and 'detrimental' were completely removed, not simplified, causing the low BERTScore.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The cause is the repeated use of grammatical structures above the A2 level.\n- B1 Structure Example 1: Using a gerund as the subject in 'Knowing this can help us...' is a B1 construction.\n- B1 Structure Example 2: The use of 'that-clauses' in 'We can notice that people think...' and 'we must remember that...' is characteristic of B1 complexity.\n- Suggestion: Restore the original meaning's strength. The concept of damaging the *building* of relationships is critical and was lost. Simplify all sentences to a Subject-Verb-Object structure. Break down any sentence containing clauses with 'that', 'how', or 'where'. For example, rewrite 'We can notice that people think and act differently' as 'We can see something. People think in different ways. People act in different ways.'",
