    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8698 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text fails the BERTScore metric. Key concepts like 'detrimental to building good business relationships' were reduced to 'bad for business relationships', losing lexical precision.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: CEFR Compliance Failure. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of using vocabulary above the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Audit: The text contains multiple words that are not on a standard A2 word list. These words artificially inflate the complexity. \n  - 'cultural' (B1)\n  - 'aware' (B1)\n  - 'awareness' (B2)\n  - 'gender' (B1)\n\n- Corrective Path: \n  - Suggestion: Remove all B1 and B2 vocabulary. You must find A2 alternatives.\n  - Suggestion: Replace 'aware' and 'awareness'. Use 'know about' or 'understand'.\n  - Suggestion: Replace 'gender'. Use 'if we are men or women'.\n  - Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore more of the original's specific phrasing without using complex words. The current version is too simplistic, causing the fidelity score to drop.",
