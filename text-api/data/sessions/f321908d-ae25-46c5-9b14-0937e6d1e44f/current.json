    "text_translated": "People can have different expectations and behaviours. Understanding this helps us avoid communication problems. However, we must remember that cultural **stereotypes** can be harmful. This is very important when we are building good business relationships. **Stereotypes are fixed and often unfair ideas about a group of people.** National cultures can influence how we behave and think. However, we are also strongly influenced by other things. For example, we are influenced by the region we come from and our communities. Our age, gender, company culture, and personal experiences also shape us. Therefore, we should remember these potential differences. But we should not use them to assume all people from a nation are the same.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that receives a top grade. It successfully passes all priority checks. \n\n1.  **Factual Integrity & Meaning Preservation:** The output is factually perfect and preserves the original meaning, confirmed by a strong MeaningBERT score of 0.76. \n2.  **CEFR Compliance:** The text correctly achieves the target B1 level, as verified by the metrics.\n3.  **Qualitative Analysis:** The simplification strategy is excellent. The writer effectively broke down long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones using appropriate B1 connectors like 'However' and 'Therefore'. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of best practice; it is bolded and followed immediately by a clear, concise definition. Advanced vocabulary such as 'detrimental' and 'pigeonhole' was skillfully replaced with B1-appropriate language ('harmful', 'assume all people from a nation are the same'). No improvements are necessary.",
