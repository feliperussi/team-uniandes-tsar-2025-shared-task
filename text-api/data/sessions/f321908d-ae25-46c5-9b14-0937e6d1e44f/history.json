The primary reason for this failure is that the core message was not fully preserved, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.69, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The issue stems from a subtle but critical loss of nuance. The original text states we are '**largely** influenced' by factors like region, age, and community, which emphasizes that these factors are often more important than national culture. The simplified output removes the adverb 'largely', stating only that we are 'influenced by many other things'. This omission alters the balance of the original argument by downplaying the significance of these other influences. To correct this, the sense of scale must be reintroduced. A better phrasing would be: 'However, we are also **strongly** influenced by many other things.' While the text successfully simplifies sentence structure and defines the keyword 'stereotypes', the failure to preserve the original's central argument is a critical error."

The primary reason for failure is that the MeaningBERT score of 0.7184 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a significant loss of the original text's nuance. While the output is factually correct and meets the B1 CEFR target, the simplification process weakened the core message. The original text uses strong, specific words like 'vital' and 'detrimental' to convey urgency and severe negative consequences. The simplification to 'very important' and 'harmful' is lexically correct but loses this intensity. Similarly, the idiomatic phrase 'keep at the back of our minds' (implying subconscious awareness) was simplified to 'keep in mind', which is more direct but less nuanced. This cumulative loss of persuasive force is what the metric has correctly identified. \n\nSuggestion for Improvement: To pass, revise the text to better capture the original's tone. For example, instead of 'it is also very important,' consider 'it is essential to remember.' This would more accurately reflect the meaning of 'vital' while remaining B1-compliant. On a positive note, the keyword 'stereotypes' was correctly identified and defined, and the sentence structure was well-simplified for the target level."

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7114 is below the required 0.75 threshold, providing quantitative evidence of a meaning shift. This is likely because the original text's nuanced instruction to 'keep [differences] at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole' was simplified in a way that lost some of its specific contrast and force.\n\nAdditionally, the submission fails on a secondary, but also critical, point: CEFR Compliance. The target level was B1, but the output was classified as B2. This is likely due to sentence complexity. The phrase '...can be harmful when building good business relationships' uses a participle clause, and the final sentence, 'Therefore, we should remember these potential differences and not use them to assume that everyone from an entire nation is the same,' is structurally too complex for a consistent B1 level. \n\nSuggestion for improvement: To meet the B1 target, split the more complex sentences. For example: 'Therefore, we should remember these potential differences. We must not use them to assume that everyone from an entire nation is the same.' On a positive note, the keyword 'stereotypes' was correctly identified and defined, which is good practice."

The original text contrasts two ways of using knowledge: keeping it 'at the back of our minds' (i.e., as secondary background information) versus using it to 'pigeonhole' people.

The output was classified as B2, exceeding the B1 target. This is likely due to the combination of formal connectors ('Therefore') and complex sentence structures, particularly the final sentence: 'We must not use this knowledge to assume that everyone from an entire nation is the same.'\n\nActionable Suggestions:\n1.  To fix the meaning preservation issue, rephrase the final part to better reflect the original's contrast. Suggestion: 'This knowledge should be a helpful guide in the background, but we must not use it to think all people from a nation are the same.'\n2.

The text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well (MeaningBERT score of 0.82), but it fails on the critical requirement of linguistic accessibility for the target audience.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis: The B2 classification was likely triggered by the sentence: 'However, it is vital to remember that cultural stereotypes can be harmful, especially when we are building good business relationships.' The combination of the formal structure 'it is vital to remember that...', the adverb 'especially', and the subordinate clause starting with 'when' increases the complexity beyond a typical B1 level.\n\nActionable Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, simplify and split the problematic sentence. For example: 'However, we must remember that cultural stereotypes can be harmful. This is very important when we are building good business relationships.'"

The writer effectively broke down long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones using appropriate B1 connectors like 'However' and 'Therefore'. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of best practice; it is bolded and followed immediately by a clear, concise definition. Advanced vocabulary such as 'detrimental' and 'pigeonhole' was skillfully replaced with B1-appropriate language ('harmful', 'assume all people from a nation are the same'). No improvements are necessary."
