This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. Specific issues include: 1. The definition of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is incomplete. The original specifies 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit', but your version omits 'of Earth's orbit', which is a critical detail for defining these objects. 2. The statement 'none of which are expected to be a threat' (NASA's official expectation) is diluted to 'We think they will not be a danger', changing the authoritative source of the information. 3. The concept of 'two defence solutions' is simplified to 'two things. These things can stop the rock', losing the specific implication of planned, strategic solutions. These omissions and shifts in emphasis collectively degrade the fidelity of the message. Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of PHAs to include 'of Earth's orbit'. Restore the agency of NASA's expectation regarding threats. Use more precise language for 'defence solutions' while maintaining A2 simplicity.",

This indicates a failure in the meticulous selection of words. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9425 and BERTScore of 0.9398 indicate good meaning preservation and fidelity, but these are secondary to the strict vocabulary requirements for A2. Specific deviations are as follows: The word \"Potentially\" is a B2 level word. It must be replaced with simpler A2 vocabulary, such as \"can be dangerous\" or \"might be dangerous\". The word \"within\" is a B1 level word. It must be rephrased using simpler A2 prepositions or sentence structures, for example, \"They pass closer than 7.5 million kilometres\". The word \"expected\" is a B1 level word. It must be replaced with simpler A2 vocabulary, such as \"think\" or \"believe\". For example, \"None are thought to be a threat\".

The text also fails the deep qualitative audit due to vocabulary.\n\n*   Vocabulary Audit Failure: The word 'Potentially' is explicitly listed as a B2 word in your provided vocabulary candidates. An A2 text must not contain words above the A2 level, even when part of a proper noun or key term. The instruction is to simplify or define keywords in A2 terms. Keeping the B2 word 'Potentially' is a direct violation of A2 vocabulary standards.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' using only A2 vocabulary, or define it in a way that avoids B2 words. For example, 'Dangerous Space Rocks' or 'Asteroids that can be a danger'.",
