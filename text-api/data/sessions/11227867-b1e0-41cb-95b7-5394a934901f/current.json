    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards. Factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning of the original text is preserved, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8309 and a BERTScore of 0.9217. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A2 level or simpler, and complex terms from the original were appropriately simplified. Sentence structures are short and direct, and the use of connectors is minimal and appropriate for A2. This is an exemplary simplification.",
