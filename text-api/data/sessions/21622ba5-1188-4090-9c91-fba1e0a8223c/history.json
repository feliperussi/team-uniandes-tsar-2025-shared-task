He is on a small boat with a big tiger. Yann Martel wrote the book. He is a writer from Canada. He wrote it in 2001. It was his third book. The book is very popular. It sold more than seven million copies in the world. It also won many prizes. People translated it into 41 languages. Martel's father was a diplomat. A diplomat is a person who works for their country in other countries. So, when Martel was a child, he lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France and Mexico.",

        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text introduces the C1 level word 'diplomat'. Explaining the word does not excuse its use. The rules demand exclusive use of A2 vocabulary. This is a critical failure. While the sentence structure is appropriately simple and the conversion of passive voice ('been translated') to active voice ('People translated it') is correct for the A2 level, the vocabulary violation is non-negotiable."

All complex vocabulary (e.g., 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', 'ferocious', 'diplomat') has been expertly replaced with simple A1/A2 words or clear, simple explanations ('had an important job for his country'). Sentence structures are simple and declarative. The passive voice ('been translated') was correctly changed to the active voice ('People translated it'). Factual accuracy is perfect. No violations of the A2 standard were found."
