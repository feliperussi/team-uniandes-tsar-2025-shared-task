    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. All complex vocabulary (e.g., 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', 'ferocious', 'diplomat') has been expertly replaced with simple A1/A2 words or clear, simple explanations ('had an important job for his country'). Sentence structures are simple and declarative. The passive voice ('been translated') was correctly changed to the active voice ('People translated it'). Factual accuracy is perfect. No violations of the A2 standard were found.",
