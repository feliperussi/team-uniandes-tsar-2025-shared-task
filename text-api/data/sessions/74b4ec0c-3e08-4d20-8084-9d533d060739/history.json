This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The score was corrupted by the addition of sentences not present in the original source, such as 'The Capitol is the government.' and the explicit definition 'To punish someone is to do something bad to them because they did something wrong.' While intended to simplify, these additions fundamentally alter the text's semantic content compared to the original, causing the low score.\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The keyword 'tributes' was identified for definition but was not defined. The text only states 'They are called \"tributes\"' without explaining what the term means in simple A2 language.\n- Structural Deviation: The direct insertion of a definition for 'punish' into the main body of the text disrupts the narrative flow and is an improper method for handling vocabulary. It deviates from the task of simplifying the original text's message.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Remove the sentences 'The Capitol is the government.' and the definition for 'punish'. These sentences are the primary cause of the meaning preservation failure.\n- Suggestion: Re-integrate the concept of punishment and rebellion into a single, cohesive idea as in the original. For example: 'The Capitol uses the games to punish the areas because they fought the government in the past.'\n- Suggestion: Provide a simple A2 definition for the keyword 'tributes' as required by the instructions.",

A reminder of a fight is not the same as an active, ongoing punishment. This is an unacceptable alteration of the source text's message.\n- While the text correctly classifies as A2 and maintains an acceptable BERTScore, the failure to preserve the central meaning makes it an immediate failure.\n- Suggestion: You must reintroduce the concept of punishment.

The text fails the qualitative audit due to the use of unapproved B1-level vocabulary, despite passing all metric-based checks.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'punish' is classified as B1. Its inclusion in the final text is a direct failure to simplify to the A2 standard. The sentence 'The Capitol uses the games to punish the areas' must be rephrased using A2 vocabulary.\n- Structural Compliance: The text successfully uses short, simple sentences and appropriate A2-level connectors like 'because'. This is correct. However, structural compliance cannot override a vocabulary failure.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the word 'punish'. Rephrase the sentence to explain the concept using only A2 vocabulary.
