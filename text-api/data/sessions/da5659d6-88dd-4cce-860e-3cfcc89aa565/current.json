This new idea is called 'buy nothing'.\n\nThis idea started in Canada in the 1990s. Then it moved to the US. In the US, people buy too many things on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The 'buy nothing' idea was a movement against buying too much.\n\nThere is a special day called 'Buy Nothing Day'. On this day, people join protests against buying too much. Some people cut up their credit cards.\n\nAll year, there are 'Buy Nothing' groups. These groups help people share things. They also help people fix things they already have.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. It meets all diagnostic criteria without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. No information was distorted.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7626 and BERTScore of 0.9051 are both above the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of the core message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier result of 'A2' is correct. The text's linguistic features align perfectly with this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 lexicon. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic connectors. The keyword 'consumerism' is defined in simple A2 terms at the beginning of the text, which is a correct and effective strategy.",
