While the metrics are acceptable, strict adherence to the A2 wordlist is non-negotiable.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'protest' is B1 level. Its inclusion is an immediate failure. An A2 text must not use B1 vocabulary. The subsequent explanatory sentence does not excuse the use of the complex term.\n- Vocabulary Risk: The word 'trend' is B1 level. While it is part of the name 'buy nothing' trend, its use should have been avoided or the concept rephrased entirely.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Command: Remove the word 'protest'. Rephrase the sentence to describe the action using A2 vocabulary. Example: 'On this day, people meet to show they are unhappy about buying too much.'\n- Command: The core task is simplification. Do not introduce vocabulary above the target level. The text must be rewritten to eliminate all B1 words.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n*   Primary Deviation: The simplification of key concepts was too extreme, resulting in a loss of meaning. The original text describes an active movement based on 'rejection' and 'protests'. Your version weakens this to the more passive 'say no' and 'show they are angry'. This fails to convey the organized, oppositional nature of the 'buy nothing' trend.\n*   Vocabulary: The vocabulary is correctly limited to the A2 level. The definition provided for 'consumerism' is adequate.\n*   Structure: The sentence structure is simple and appropriate for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the text to better capture the idea of active opposition. For example, instead of 'people show they are angry', use a phrase like 'people join together to protest'. Instead of 'a way to say no', use 'a movement against overspending'.",
