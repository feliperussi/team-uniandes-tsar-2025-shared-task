This means they can pass close to Earth's orbit, which is its path around the sun. They can come within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids. However, NASA does not think any of them will be a threat in the next one hundred years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects. They can also predict a possible impact. An impact is when an asteroid hits something. If this happens, there are two defence solutions that could be used to protect Earth.",

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text is clear, coherent, and logically structured. You have successfully demonstrated the ability to write connected text by using a variety of sentence structures. Your use of connectors is a key strength, for example, '...orbit, which is its path around the sun' and 'An impact is when an asteroid hits something.' These sentences show a clear B1 competence in linking and explaining ideas. The vocabulary is well-managed, using core B1 words effectively and providing simple definitions for important concepts. The text is factually accurate and fully addresses the original source material. Well done."
