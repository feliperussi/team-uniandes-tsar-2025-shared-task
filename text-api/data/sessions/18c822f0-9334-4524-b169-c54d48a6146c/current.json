    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks that fly through space. Some of these rocks are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. This means they can pass very close to Earth's orbit, which is its path around the sun. They can come within 7.5 million kilometres of our planet. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids. However, NASA does not think any of them will be a danger in the next 100 years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects. They can also predict a possible impact. An impact is when an asteroid hits something. If this happens, there are two ways to protect Earth.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text is clear, coherent, and logically structured. You have successfully demonstrated the ability to write connected text by using a variety of sentence structures. Your use of connectors is a key strength, for example, '...orbit, which is its path around the sun' and 'An impact is when an asteroid hits something.' These sentences show a clear B1 competence in linking and explaining ideas. The vocabulary is well-managed, using core B1 words effectively and providing simple definitions for important concepts. The text is factually accurate and fully addresses the original source material. Well done.",
