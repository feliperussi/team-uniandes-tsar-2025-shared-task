Although most business people around the world use English to communicate, the way people communicate can be very different in each culture.\n\nIf you do not understand the normal business rules of another culture, it can cause problems. This can lead to misunderstandings and stop good communication. You might also form unfair opinions about the people you work with.\n\nHere are three basic differences in polite business behavior around the world. This information will help you the next time you work with someone from a different culture.",

    "feedback": "This text is a strong example of B1-level writing. The structure is clear and logical, with ideas well-organized into paragraphs. The sentence construction demonstrates solid B1 competence, particularly in the use of connectors to link ideas in longer sentences, such as 'Although most business people...' and 'If you do not understand...'. The vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level; you have successfully paraphrased complex concepts from the original text (e.g., 'cultural norms' becomes 'normal business rules') using a core vocabulary, which is an excellent skill. The summary is factually accurate and effectively conveys the main points of the source text.",
