        "feedback_text": "While you have successfully understood and conveyed the main ideas of the original text, the writing does not meet the B1 standard for structure and flow. Several sentences contain basic grammatical errors that make them difficult to read. For example, 'A lot of business in today is to between different countries' is not a correct sentence structure. A B1 level sentence would be: 'Today, a lot of business is conducted between different countries.' Additionally, the sentence 'If most people around the world use English, however the way people communicate...' is a run-on sentence; these two ideas should be in separate sentences or connected correctly with a word like 'although'. Your vocabulary is mostly at an A2 level. To reach B1, focus on correctly using connectors (e.g., 'although', 'however', 'because') to build clear, grammatically sound compound sentences."

        "feedback_text": "This text is a strong example of B1-level writing. The structure is clear and logical, with ideas well-organized into paragraphs. The sentence construction demonstrates solid B1 competence, particularly in the use of connectors to link ideas in longer sentences, such as 'Although most business people...' and 'If you do not understand...'. The vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level; you have successfully paraphrased complex concepts from the original text (e.g., 'cultural norms' becomes 'normal business rules') using a core vocabulary, which is an excellent skill. The summary is factually accurate and effectively conveys the main points of the source text."
