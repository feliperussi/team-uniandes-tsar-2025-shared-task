This is an instant failure.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The core meaning of conditionality was lost. The original text states 'Whether NASA can find... depends on getting the money'. Your version, 'NASA wants to find... But they need money', changes a conditional statement into a simple statement of desire and need. This alters the central message.\n- Secondary Deviation: The meaning of 'work out how to defend' was diluted. Your text states the team 'needs a plan'. This is too passive. The original implies an active, ongoing process of problem-solving, which your simplification loses.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The phrase 'planetary defence team' uses the B1 word 'defence'. While you explained the team's purpose, the use of a B1 term is a violation of the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Change 'NASA wants to find...' to 'NASA can find the asteroids only if they get money...'. Change 'a special team needs a plan' to 'a special team must think about how to stop the dangerous asteroids'. Replace 'planetary defence team' with 'a team to protect our planet'.",

This simplification loses the critical concept of defense against a physical impact, which is the reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Grammar): The CEFR classifier incorrectly rated this text as A2. The sentence 'Infrared light is a light people cannot see' uses a reduced relative clause ('a light [that] people cannot see'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase to include the concept of 'protecting the planet from being hit'.

People cannot see it.\"\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences. Connectors are limited to basic A2 forms ('but', 'if', 'after'). The overall structure is clear and easy for an A2 reader to follow.\n- Keyword Definition: The provided definition for 'asteroids' (\"Asteroids are small rocks in space\") is a model of A2 simplicity and accuracy.",
