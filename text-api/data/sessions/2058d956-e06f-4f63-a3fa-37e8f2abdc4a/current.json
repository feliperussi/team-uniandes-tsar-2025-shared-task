    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7096 is below the required threshold of 0.75. This is a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The original text states supermarkets signed a 'pact promising to transform packaging'. Your version, 'agreed to a plan to make changes', is a significant downgrade in meaning. It loses the critical concept of a formal, binding promise and replaces it with a weak, non-committal plan.\n- The original's 'consumer backlash' implies organized, public pressure. Your version, 'Customers were very angry', simplifies this to a general emotion, losing the nuance of a targeted reaction that forced change.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.9001 is technically a pass, the failure on the MeaningBERT metric indicates that while you used similar words, the overall message was distorted.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the lost meaning. The concept of a 'pact' or 'strong promise' must be included. Change 'agreed to a plan' to 'made a strong promise to change'.",
