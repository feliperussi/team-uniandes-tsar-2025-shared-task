This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8965 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a loss of key vocabulary.\n\n- The primary failure is the dilution of meaning. The original text's concepts of 'accusations,' 'unethical acts,' and 'consumer backlash' are central. Your version's 'people said,' 'did not do the right thing,' and 'customers were very angry' are too simple and lose the sense of formal public criticism and pressure.\n- The phrase 'come under fire' implies a sustained period of intense criticism. 'People said' does not carry this meaning and is a factual simplification.\n- The term 'pact' in the original implies a formal, binding agreement. Your replacement, 'plan,' is weaker and less specific, which contributed to the low metric scores.\n- While the text correctly classifies as A2, its oversimplification has damaged the integrity of the original message, leading to the metric failures.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. The concept of public criticism must be clearer. Instead of 'people said,' use 'Many people said that the supermarkets were doing bad things.' To restore the concept of a formal agreement, change 'agreed to a new plan' to 'promised to make changes.'",
