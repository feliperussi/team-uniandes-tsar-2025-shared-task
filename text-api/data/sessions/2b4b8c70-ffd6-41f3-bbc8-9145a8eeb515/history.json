The text fails to meet the minimum requirements for meaning preservation and lexical fidelity.\n\nThe MeaningBERT score of 0.6009 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the extreme danger of high-altitude climbing and the specific motivation of elite climbers seeking new challenges is not adequately preserved. The original's 'extremely dangerous' is diluted to 'very dangerous', and 'look for new challenges' is weakened to 'want new difficult things', losing the precise meaning and intensity.\n\nThe BERTScore of 0.8991 is below the required 0.90. This indicates an unacceptable loss of lexical detail. The term 'climbers' was replaced with the less specific 'people'. The descriptive phrase 'freezing conditions and violent storms' was fragmented and simplified to 'very cold there' and 'very strong storms', losing the combined impact and specific vocabulary of the original.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to accurately convey the intensity of the danger and the specific motivation for new challenges. Use 'climbers' instead of 'people' where appropriate to maintain lexical accuracy. Ensure that descriptive elements like 'freezing conditions and violent storms' are simplified but retain their core meaning and impact within A2 vocabulary.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy and Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on multiple high-priority checks. 1. Factual Inaccuracy: The output introduces facts not present in the original text. The statement 'Everest is the highest mountain in the world' is an addition. The original text does not state this. The statement 'Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner is a woman's name. She is a famous climber' contains two unstated facts. The original text does not mention her name is a woman's name, nor does it state she is famous. This is a significant deviation from the original's factual scope. 2. Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6217 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and the relationships between ideas in the original text. The original text connects the danger of climbing with the best climbers looking for new challenges. Your version separates these ideas into distinct, disconnected sentences: 'Climbing high mountains is very, very dangerous. But the best climbers now look for new hard things.' This loses the causal or contrasting relationship. The introduction of Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner is fragmented and includes unstated facts, disrupting the flow and purpose of her mention in the original text. Suggestions: Remove all information not explicitly stated in the original text. Do not add external facts, even if true. Ensure the logical connections and flow of ideas from the original text are maintained. Do not break down related concepts into isolated sentences. Rephrase to ensure the core message, including implied relationships between ideas, is fully preserved.",
