    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7308 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to adequately preserve the core message of the original.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text establishes a direct causal link: 'improvements... fuelling rapid population growth'. Your version weakens this relationship by splitting it into two separate statements: 'technology and health got better' and 'This meant fewer children died young, so the number of people grew very fast'. This separation reduces the semantic strength of the cause-and-effect relationship, resulting in a lower meaning score.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: The original text states the number of babies declined 'to as low as two'. Your version uses 'to about two'. This changes the meaning from a specific lower boundary to a general approximation, losing critical precision from the source text.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to more directly connect the cause and effect. For example: 'Because technology and health got better, fewer children died young and the population grew very fast.'\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the original precision. The phrase 'as low as two' must be simplified while retaining its meaning, not replaced with an approximation. Use 'went down to only two'.",
