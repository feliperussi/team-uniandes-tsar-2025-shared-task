    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core meaning and key details were successfully preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was very effective, particularly in breaking down the first long sentence into two clearer, more manageable sentences. The vocabulary choices were strong, for example, replacing 'ruddy' with 'red' and 'atlas' with 'map'. For future improvement, consider simplifying the C1-level word 'trail' to an alternative like 'line of dust', but this is a minor point in an otherwise outstanding submission.",
