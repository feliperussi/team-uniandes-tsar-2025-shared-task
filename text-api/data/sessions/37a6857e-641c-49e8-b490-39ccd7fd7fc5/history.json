This is likely because the original sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job' was changed to 'He wanted to stay out of his boss\u2019s way to keep his job.' The simplification lost the original's meaning of a direct, proportional relationship between staying away and job security. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR Compliance check. The output was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1', likely due to overly complex sentence structures. For instance, the final sentence is too long and contains multiple clauses for a B1 level. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences, such as 'His skin was already turning red in the June sun. Otherwise, he had the indoor tan of a man who made money while other people did the work.' On a positive note, the text passed the factual integrity check and the vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'atlas' to 'map') was effective.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6848, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a change in the core message. The likely cause is the restructuring of the third sentence. The original text states, 'Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to,' presenting two separate facts. The output combines them into a single cause-and-effect statement: 'Sam waited because Mr. Carter only came out here when he had to.' This insertion of 'because' creates an explicit causal link that was only implied in the original, altering the semantic nuance. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the use of advanced grammatical structures, such as the comparative correlative 'The more... the longer...' and the final complex sentence containing multiple clauses. Suggestion: To fix the meaning issue, separate the third sentence back into two distinct ideas. To achieve B1 compliance, simplify the complex grammatical structures, for instance by splitting the final sentence.",

While the text is factually correct and meets the B1 CEFR target, it fails to adequately preserve the core meaning and nuance of the original. The low score is likely due to several subtle but cumulative changes. For example, the original states 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job,' which implies a continuous, proportional relationship. The simplified version, 'If he stayed out of his boss\u2019s way, he would keep his job,' turns this into a simple conditional, losing the sense of ongoing caution. Additionally, changing 'their owner's first visit in ten months' to 'their owner had not visited for ten months' loses the specific detail that this is the *first* visit after a long absence. To improve, focus on preserving these subtle but important details while simplifying the language. A better simplification might be: 'Sam knew that staying away from his boss was the best way to keep his job' and 'They did not care that this was their owner's first visit in ten months.'",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core meaning and key details were successfully preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was very effective, particularly in breaking down the first long sentence into two clearer, more manageable sentences. The vocabulary choices were strong, for example, replacing 'ruddy' with 'red' and 'atlas' with 'map'. For future improvement, consider simplifying the C1-level word 'trail' to an alternative like 'line of dust', but this is a minor point in an otherwise outstanding submission.",
