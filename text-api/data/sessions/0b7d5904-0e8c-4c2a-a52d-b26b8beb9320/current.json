    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states, 'It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star.' Your version omits the crucial condition 'if he hadn't become a star', which fundamentally alters the meaning by removing the contrast between his actual life as a star and the hypothetical life he might have had. This is a critical deviation from the original message. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8896 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. For example, 'powerhouse classics' was simplified to 'strong, old songs', and 'bitterness' to 'unhappy', which, while simplifying, reduces lexical fidelity. Furthermore, the writer's output includes an explicit definition of 'The American dream'. While this clarifies the concept for an A2 audience, it is an addition not present in the original text and deviates from strict content fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence about the artist's life to include the conditional clause 'if he hadn't become a star' in a simplified A2 form. Ensure all key lexical items are preserved or simplified without losing their core meaning.",

They carry emotional weight.\n\nThe music has catchy rock melodies. But the songs tell stories about the bad side of the \"American dream.\" The American dream means everyone in America can get rich and be happy if they work hard.\n\nMany songs are about normal people. These people work hard. They feel sad and very angry. Life does not give them money or great success.\n\nFor example, \"Glory Days\" is about people in a small town. They remember their young days. They felt the world was at their feet. \"Downbound Train\" is about a young man. His life becomes very bad. He loses his job.\n\nIt is easy to think the artist writes about real people he knew.
