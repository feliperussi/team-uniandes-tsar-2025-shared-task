    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games are an annual event. The Capitol (capital city) uses the event to show the districts. The districts are punished for rebelling. Each district chooses one boy and one girl by lottery. They are 12 to 18 years old. They fight in a battle. Only one person survives. The chosen teenagers are called tributes (players). The whole nation must watch the event on television.",

    "feedback": "Mostly B1: clear sentences, simple grammar, keywords defined. Keyword handling: \"Capitol (government of Panem)\" and \"tributes\" are briefly defined at first mention. However, fidelity slips: \"starts them to punish the districts for a past rebellion\" changes \"uses to remind the districts that they are being punished\" (purpose shifts from reminder to punishment). Vocabulary: \"random draw\" is above B1 and not a keyword; original used the simpler, specific \"lottery.\" \"rebellion\" may be above B1; original had \"rebelling.\" Cohesion: basic connectors used well. Form: one sentence is too long for B1\u2014\"Every year, one boy and one girl, from 12 to 18 years old, are chosen from each district in a random draw.\" (\u224822 words). Accuracy: numbers and roles are preserved. Minor addition: \"Panem\" is introduced; it is not in the Original.",
