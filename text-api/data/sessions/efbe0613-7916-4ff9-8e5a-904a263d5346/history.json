You also replace \"uses to remind\" with \"starts them to punish,\" removing the key idea of \"remind\" and adding \"past,\" which is not stated. 2) Lexis level: \"rebellion\" (in place of Original \"rebelling\") and the phrase \"random draw\" are likely above B1 and not defined as Keywords. The Original uses the simpler, provided B1 word \"lottery.\" 3) Sentence length: \"Every year, one boy and one girl, from 12 to 18 years old, are chosen from each district in a random draw.\" is 22 words, exceeding the \u224815-word target. 4) Possible fidelity softening: \"They must fight in a competition\" weakens Original \"battle\" (B1 and more precise about violence). 5) Keyword handling: \"Capitol\" and \"tributes\" are briefly defined; that part is acceptable. Grammar and connectors are mostly B1, but the above issues prevent a pass."
