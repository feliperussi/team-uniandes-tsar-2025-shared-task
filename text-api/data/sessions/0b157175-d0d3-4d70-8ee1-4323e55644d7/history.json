While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning, the vocabulary choices were consistently simplified below the B1 threshold, resulting in an A2 classification. For example, 'emigrate' was simplified to 'move', 'terrible storm' to 'very bad storm', 'drown' to 'die in the water when the ship sinks', 'enormous tiger' to 'very big tiger', and 'lifeboat' to 'small boat'. These changes, while making the text easier, collectively push it into the A2 band. To achieve a B1 classification, the writer should aim to retain or introduce vocabulary that is firmly B1, rather than simplifying to A2. For instance, 'drown' and 'lifeboat' are appropriate B1 words and could have been retained. The goal is simplification to B1, not A2.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8481 and BERTScore of 0.9836 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The writer made minor but effective grammatical improvements, such as changing 'don't' to 'do not', correcting 'travel' to 'travels', and adding articles before the list of animals ('a zebra, an orang-utan'). The replacement of 'Tragically' with 'Sadly' is a good simplification, moving from a potentially higher-level word to a more accessible one while maintaining the emotional tone. The decision to retain 'drown' is appropriate, as it is a key term that is generally understood within a B1 context, especially given the narrative. The flow of the text is smooth, and the addition of 'However, during the journey' enhances coherence. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
