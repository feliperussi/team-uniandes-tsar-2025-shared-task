    "text_translated": "When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents do not support. Worried about the future, Pi's parents decide to close their zoo and emigrate to Canada. Some of the animals are sold to zoos in North America, and the family travels by ship to Canada, taking the other animals with them. However, during the journey, there is a terrible storm, and the ship sinks. Sadly, Pi's family and all the sailors drown, but Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orang-utan, and an enormous tiger.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors; the output accurately reflects all information from the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8481 and BERTScore of 0.9836 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The writer made minor but effective grammatical improvements, such as changing 'don't' to 'do not', correcting 'travel' to 'travels', and adding articles before the list of animals ('a zebra, an orang-utan'). The replacement of 'Tragically' with 'Sadly' is a good simplification, moving from a potentially higher-level word to a more accessible one while maintaining the emotional tone. The decision to retain 'drown' is appropriate, as it is a key term that is generally understood within a B1 context, especially given the narrative. The flow of the text is smooth, and the addition of 'However, during the journey' enhances coherence. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
