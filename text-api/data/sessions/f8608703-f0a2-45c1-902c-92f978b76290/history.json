This is an instant failure.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The simplification process has removed the core emotional meaning of the original text. While factually correct, the text is semantically weak.\n- Evidence: The original text describes an 'extraordinary' story about a boy who is 'trapped' with a 'ferocious' tiger. Your version reduces this to a 'very interesting' story about a boy on a boat with a 'dangerous' tiger. This substitution loses the intensity, desperation, and uniqueness central to the original message.\n- Structural Analysis: The sentence structure and vocabulary are appropriate for the A2 level, and the text correctly passed the CEFR classifier as A2. The BERTScore of 0.9057 is also acceptable, indicating key factual terms were retained.\n- Conclusion: The text fails because it does not adequately preserve the meaning and tone of the source material, as confirmed by the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. The goal is simplification, not sanitization. Rephrase to convey the original's sense of danger and wonder. Use phrases like 'a special and surprising story' instead of 'a very interesting story'. Add a sentence to better explain the concept of being 'trapped', for example: 'He was stuck on the boat and could not get away.'",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core meaning, even though the facts are technically correct.\n\n- Meaning Deviation 1: The original text describes the story as 'extraordinary'. Your version, 'a story that is very hard to believe', changes the meaning from 'amazing and special' to 'unbelievable and possibly untrue'. This is a significant semantic shift.\n\n- Meaning Deviation 2: The original text states Martel is the 'son of a diplomat'. Your simplification, 'father had an important job for his country', is too vague. It loses the specific meaning of a government official working in foreign countries, which is central to explaining why the family moved so much.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is overly fragmented. While short sentences are required for A2, the constant use of one-clause sentences makes the text choppy and unnatural. For example: 'The story is about a boy from India. His name is Pi. His boat sinks...'\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Replace 'hard to believe' with a simple positive adjective like 'amazing'. Rephrase the description of the father's job to be more specific, such as 'His father worked for the government in other countries'. Combine some of the very short, related sentences using simple connectors like 'and'.",
