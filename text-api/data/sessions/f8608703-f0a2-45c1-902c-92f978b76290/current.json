    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all stages of the diagnostic protocol.\n\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All names, numbers, and core concepts are correctly preserved.\n\nMetric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.76) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core meaning and key lexical items have been preserved with high fidelity.\n\nCEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids complex B1 structures and vocabulary entirely.\n\nQualitative Analysis: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. The simplification of 'diplomat' to 'worked for the government' and 'ferocious' to 'very wild' are model examples of A2 writing. Sentence structures are short, clear, and use only basic A2 connectors ('and', 'so'). The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. No deviations were found.",
