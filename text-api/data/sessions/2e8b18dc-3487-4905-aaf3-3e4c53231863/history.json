While the factual points are present, the core message's nuance regarding public scrutiny and the formal nature of the supermarkets' response has been diminished. The original text emphasizes 'come under fire with accusations' and 'consumer backlash' leading to signing 'a pact', which conveys a stronger sense of public pressure and a structured, formal response. Your version simplifies this to 'did many bad things' and 'shoppers are very angry' leading to 'made a promise', which loses some of the original's specific meaning and tone. Suggestion: Rephrase to better capture the idea of public accusations and formal agreements, even with simple A2 vocabulary. For example, 'People said supermarkets did bad things' or 'Supermarkets promised in a special way'.",

The core message and nuance of the original text have been significantly diluted. The simplification has removed important aspects of the original meaning. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: The phrase 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' was simplified to 'people said supermarkets did many bad things'. This loses the specific meaning of public scrutiny and moral failing implied by 'unethical acts' and 'come under fire'. 'Bad things' is too general. Deviation: The phrase 'growing consumer backlash against the huge amounts of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging' was simplified to 'Shoppers were very angry about the plastic packaging. They complained a lot.' This loses the stronger, more organized, and sustained negative reaction implied by 'backlash' and the specific detail of 'huge amounts of plastic waste generated'. Deviation: The phrase 'signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' was simplified to 'signed a special paper. They made a promise. They will change their packaging. They will use less plastic.' While this is a good simplification for A2, 'pact' implies a more formal agreement than 'special paper', and 'transform' suggests a more significant change than simply 'change'. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the severity of the accusations and the nature of the consumer reaction, ensuring the core meaning of public criticism and formal agreement is retained within A2 vocabulary.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6685 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance and intensity. The BERTScore of 0.8981 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations include: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text's emphasis on 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' was diluted to 'people were very angry' and 'shoppers were very angry'. This simplification loses the specific, formal nature of the original's critique. The concept of a 'pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' was reduced to a 'special promise' and 'agreement' to 'change all their packaging' and 'use much less plastic', which diminishes the specific, active verbs 'transform' and 'cut wastage'. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items were replaced or omitted. 'Major supermarket chains' was simplified to 'supermarkets'. 'Come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' was replaced with 'people were very angry with supermarkets. People said supermarkets did many bad things.', losing the specific terms 'come under fire', 'accusations', and 'unethical acts'. 'Tonnes of food' became 'very much food', losing the specific unit. 'Underpaid their suppliers' became 'did not pay their suppliers enough', a less precise phrasing. 'Excessive plastic waste' was simplified to 'too much plastic waste'. The term 'grocers' was omitted. 'Sit up and take notice' was replaced by 'listening. They are paying attention.', losing the idiomatic expression. 'Growing consumer backlash against the huge amounts of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging' was significantly simplified to 'More and more shoppers were very angry about plastic packaging. They told supermarkets to change.', losing critical terms like 'consumer backlash', 'huge amounts', and 'generated'. The specific terms 'pact', 'transform', and 'cut wastage' were not retained in the final sentence. Suggestion: Reintroduce stronger, more specific vocabulary to convey the original's meaning and detail, ensuring that key concepts like 'accusations', 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', 'pact', 'transform', and 'cut wastage' are preserved in A2-appropriate language. Do not dilute the core message or specific details.",

The primary reason for this deviation is the consistent use of vocabulary above the A2 level. Specific deviations are as follows: The word 'accused' is classified as C1. An A2 text must use simpler phrasing such as 'people said they did bad things' or 'people complained about bad acts'. The word 'backlash' is above A2 level. While you attempted to explain it, the word itself is not A2. This concept must be conveyed using only A2 vocabulary, for example, 'Many shoppers were very angry about the plastic. They showed their anger'. The word 'transform' is classified as B1. An A2 text must use simpler words like 'change' or 'make new'. The word 'pact' is above A2 level. An A2 text must use simpler words like 'agreement' or 'promise'. The word 'waste' is classified as B1. This word is used multiple times and must be simplified or replaced with A2 terms like 'rubbish' or 'things thrown away' or by using phrases like 'too much plastic'.",
