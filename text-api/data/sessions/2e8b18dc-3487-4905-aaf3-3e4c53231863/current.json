They told the supermarkets to change. So, some big UK supermarkets made a promise together. They will change packaging a lot. They will not use too much plastic.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability requirements. It maintains factual integrity and the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.7658 and BERTScore of 0.9075, both exceeding the minimum thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is appropriate for an A2 level, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to 'But' and 'So', which are suitable for A2. This is a well-executed simplification.",
