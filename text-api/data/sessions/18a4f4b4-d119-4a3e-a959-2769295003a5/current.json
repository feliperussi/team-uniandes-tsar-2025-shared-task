    "text_translated": "Over the last ten years, many major supermarkets have faced strong criticism for various unethical actions. They have wasted a lot of food, paid their suppliers too little, and used too much plastic for their packaging, which has had a bad effect on our environment. However, supermarkets are now starting to pay attention to this problem. In response to a strong negative reaction from customers about the huge amount of waste from plastic packaging, some of the biggest UK supermarkets have made a promise to change their packaging and reduce the amount of plastic they use.",

    "feedback": "Excellent work. This submission passes all checks with high scores. The simplification successfully navigated several complex phrases and idioms from the original text. For example, 'come under fire' was accurately simplified to 'faced strong criticism', and the idiom 'sit up and take notice' was correctly rephrased as 'pay attention'. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.94) confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly meets the B1 CEFR target. The vocabulary choices, such as using 'criticism', 'reaction', and 'waste', are well-aligned with the B1 level, while more complex terms were effectively simplified. This is a model example of a successful B1 simplification, demonstrating strong vocabulary control and structural clarity.",
