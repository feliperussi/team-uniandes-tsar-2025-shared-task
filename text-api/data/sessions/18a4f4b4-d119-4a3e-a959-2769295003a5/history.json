The failure is likely due to the simplification of 'consumer backlash' to 'Customers have become very unhappy'. The original term 'backlash' implies an active, strong, and public reaction that forced the supermarkets to change. The simplified version describes a more passive state of unhappiness, losing the critical cause-and-effect dynamic of public pressure leading to corporate action. To fix this, consider a B1-level phrase that retains the sense of active opposition, such as 'Customers have complained strongly' or 'Customers have reacted angrily'. On a positive note, the submission is factually accurate, achieved an excellent BERTScore of 0.93, and was correctly classified at the B1 level. The vocabulary simplification and sentence restructuring were otherwise very effective.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7095 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the core message's intensity. The failure is likely due to the simplification of key concepts that carry significant weight in the original text. For example, the original's 'accusations of unethical acts' implies a serious, formal charge, which is diluted to the more general 'criticized for doing things that are wrong'. Similarly, 'consumer backlash' suggests a strong, collective reaction that is not fully captured by 'customers have complained strongly'. To improve the score while maintaining B1 simplicity, consider using phrasing that better reflects the original's tone, such as 'faced strong criticism for unethical actions'. On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, meets the B1 CEFR target, and uses good simplification strategies for vocabulary and sentence structure.",

        "feedback_text": "Excellent work. This submission passes all checks with high scores. The simplification successfully navigated several complex phrases and idioms from the original text. For example, 'come under fire' was accurately simplified to 'faced strong criticism', and the idiom 'sit up and take notice' was correctly rephrased as 'pay attention'. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.94) confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly meets the B1 CEFR target. The vocabulary choices, such as using 'criticism', 'reaction', and 'waste', are well-aligned with the B1 level, while more complex terms were effectively simplified. This is a model example of a successful B1 simplification, demonstrating strong vocabulary control and structural clarity.",
