    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8814 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a loss of key information from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The original text states subordinates work with bosses to \"find solutions and make decisions.\" Your version omits \"and make decisions,\" which is a critical factual detail. This is the primary reason for the low BERTScore.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not A2. This is unacceptable.\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word \"encourage\" is B1 level. It must be replaced. The phrase \"independent thought\" is also too abstract and complex for the A2 level.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence \"It is about how much power leaders have\" uses a subordinate clause that increases complexity beyond the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the omitted detail \"and make decisions.\" Replace \"encourage\" with an A2 phrase like \"want them to.\" Rephrase \"independent thought\" to \"think for themselves.\" Simplify the sentence explaining power distance. For example: \"This idea explains the power of leaders.\"",
