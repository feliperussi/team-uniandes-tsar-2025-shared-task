This is a B1 grammatical structure and is too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Failure: The output is a list of disconnected, choppy sentences.

This indicates a critical loss of the original message.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text is a narrative about Gabriela's personal experience contrasting two work cultures. Your output transforms this into a generic definition, losing the central story. The core meaning is not preserved.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8632 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a result of oversimplification. Key phrases like 'previous work environment' and 'encourage independent thought' were completely removed, damaging the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is unacceptable. The structure 'how a group sees power' is an embedded question, and 'want workers to ask questions' is a verb + object + infinitive pattern. Both are B1-level structures.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is a series of disconnected, choppy sentences. This is not effective A2 writing; it is a list. It fails to connect ideas using simple A2 connectors like 'but' or 'so'.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the entire text. Start with Gabriela's experience as the main subject. Do not write a dictionary definition. Re-integrate key phrases from the original. Simplify B1 structures. For example, change 'how a group sees power' to 'what a group thinks about power'. Connect sentences using 'but' to show the contrast between the two cultures.",

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check. The classifier result is B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of using B1-level vocabulary. The following deviations were found:\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'authority' is used twice. This is a B1 word and is not permissible at the A2 level.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'encourage' is used. This is a B1 word and is not permissible at the A2 level.\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is composed of excessively short, choppy sentences. This oversimplification is characteristic of an A1 level, not A2. The repetition of 'Leaders act as...' is unnatural.\n- Keyword Definition: The definition for 'power distance culture' is fragmented across multiple sentences and is not a clear, simple explanation as required.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all B1 vocabulary immediately. Replace 'authority' with an A2 concept like 'the power of leaders'. Replace 'encourage' with an A2 phrase like 'help people to have'. Combine some of the short, repetitive sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' to create a more natural text flow. Provide a single, simple sentence to define the keyword.",

This is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'Power distance culture is how a group thinks about the power of leaders' uses a subordinate clause starting with 'how', which increases the grammatical complexity beyond the A2 standard.\n\n- Corrective Actions: Rephrase the text to remove all B1 structures. Replace 'used to work' with a simple past tense construction like 'Before, Gabriela worked...'. The definition sentence must be broken into two simple A2 sentences.
