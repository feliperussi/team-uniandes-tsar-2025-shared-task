It is a model of simplification for the A2 level.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, names, and numbers from the original text are preserved with 100% accuracy.\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7521 and BERTScore of 0.9041 meet the required thresholds, confirming the core message and key terms are intact.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2, meeting the primary objective.\n- Structural Simplification: The writer correctly deconstructed complex B1 sentences into short, simple declarative statements suitable for A2. The conversion of 'Having climbed Everest, Gerlinde decided...' into two separate sentences is a perfect execution of A2 simplification.\n- Vocabulary Control: All vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. The replacement of 'risky' with 'dangerous' and 'low oxygen levels' with 'thin air' is an appropriate and effective simplification.",
