The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.878, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship: 'This is risky as low oxygen levels...'. Your output breaks this into two disconnected statements: 'This is dangerous. Thin air can affect the head.' This separation destroys the logical connection, which is a severe failure in preserving meaning.\n- Fidelity Loss: The simplification of '8,000 metre peaks' to 'very high mountains' and 'oxygen tanks' to 'extra air' contributed to the low BERTScore, indicating a loss of key lexical information.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'being' is classified as B2. Its use in the phrase 'She uses being famous' is grammatically too complex for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning by using an A2-level connector. Rephrase 'This is dangerous. Thin air can affect the head.' to 'This is dangerous because the air is thin.' Remove the B2-level word 'being'. Rephrase 'She is a famous climber. She uses this to help a charity...'",

This is a failure to preserve meaning.\n- Excessive Simplification: The text is broken into too many short, choppy sentences.
