    "text_translated": "Many big supermarkets have been criticised for doing many bad things in the last ten years. For example, they have wasted a lot of food, paid their suppliers too little, and made too much plastic waste with their packaging, which has damaged our environment. However, supermarkets and grocers are now starting to pay attention because many customers have complained about the large amount of plastic waste from packaging, so some of the biggest supermarkets in the UK have agreed to a plan to change their packaging and use less plastic.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8109 and BERTScore of 0.9354 both comfortably exceeded the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, demonstrating successful simplification to the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy was highly effective. Complex phrases such as 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' were skillfully rephrased to 'been criticised for doing many bad things', and 'contributed to excessive plastic waste' became 'made too much plastic waste'. The use of connectors like 'For example' and 'However' ensures a smooth and logical flow, making the text easy to follow for a B1 reader. Vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate replacements or retention where suitable. The overall structure is clear and coherent. This is a very strong simplification.",
