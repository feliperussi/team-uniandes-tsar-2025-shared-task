For example, they have wasted a lot of food, paid their suppliers too little, and made too much plastic waste with their packaging, which has damaged our environment. However, supermarkets are now starting to pay attention because many customers have complained about the large amount of plastic waste from packaging, so some of the biggest supermarkets in the UK have agreed to a plan to change their packaging and use less plastic.",

There are no factual errors, and the meaning and fidelity metrics (MeaningBERT 0.7984, BERTScore 0.9327) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The simplification effectively rephrases complex vocabulary and sentence structures without losing essential information. For example, 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' was simplified to 'been criticised for doing many bad things', and 'signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' became 'agreed to a plan to change their packaging and use less plastic'. The use of connectors like 'For example' and 'However' aids in maintaining a clear and coherent flow, suitable for a B1 reader. The vocabulary strategy was well-executed, retaining appropriate B1 words like 'waste' and 'damaged' while simplifying more complex phrasing. The only minor point is the omission of 'grocers' from 'supermarkets and grocers', but this does not constitute a factual error or significant loss of meaning. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification.",

The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, demonstrating successful simplification to the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy was highly effective. Complex phrases such as 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' were skillfully rephrased to 'been criticised for doing many bad things', and 'contributed to excessive plastic waste' became 'made too much plastic waste'. The use of connectors like 'For example' and 'However' ensures a smooth and logical flow, making the text easy to follow for a B1 reader. Vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate replacements or retention where suitable. The overall structure is clear and coherent. This is a very strong simplification.",
