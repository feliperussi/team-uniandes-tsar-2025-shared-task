    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and phrasing. The B1 classification is accurate. The standout feature of this output is the successful handling of keywords: defining 'graffiti' and 'street art' at the beginning provides essential context for a B1 reader. Vocabulary simplification is also effective, such as changing 'recognition of its value' to 'started to see more value' and 'merely' to 'just'. The use of connectors like 'and this has led to' and 'so' creates a logical flow that is appropriate for the target level. To reach a perfect score, the first three sentences could be integrated more smoothly, but this is a minor point in an otherwise outstanding submission.",
