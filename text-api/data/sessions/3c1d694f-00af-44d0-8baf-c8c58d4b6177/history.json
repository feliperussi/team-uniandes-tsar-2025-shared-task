        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. The primary reason for this is the first sentence: 'Graffiti, which is drawing or writing on walls in public places, and street art, which is any artwork created outside museums, are now being discussed by the art world.' This sentence structure, using two non-defining relative clauses to define the subjects, is too advanced for B1 readers. The use of the passive voice ('are being discussed') and B2-level vocabulary ('recognition', 'being') also contributed to the higher CEFR rating. Suggestion: Break the first sentence into three simpler sentences. For example: 'Graffiti is drawing or writing on walls in public places. Street art is artwork created outside museums. The art world is now discussing both of these art forms.'",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and phrasing. The B1 classification is accurate. The standout feature of this output is the successful handling of keywords: defining 'graffiti' and 'street art' at the beginning provides essential context for a B1 reader. Vocabulary simplification is also effective, such as changing 'recognition of its value' to 'started to see more value' and 'merely' to 'just'. The use of connectors like 'and this has led to' and 'so' creates a logical flow that is appropriate for the target level. To reach a perfect score, the first three sentences could be integrated more smoothly, but this is a minor point in an otherwise outstanding submission.",
