One kind of show was a 'reality' show. In these shows, young people tried to win a million dollars. The other kind of show was the news about the war. Suzanne says the two ideas mixed together in her head. It was a strange feeling. Then she had the idea for The Hunger Games.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text.\n- Metrics Compliance: MeaningBERT score of 0.8379 and BERTScore of 0.9334 are well above the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of meaning and lexical detail.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classifier result is correct. The text is a model of A2-level writing.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates exemplary adherence to A2 standards. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple declarative sentences. The simplification of the B1 structure 'Suzanne says that the two things start to merge' to the A2-compliant 'Suzanne says the two ideas mixed' is a perfect execution. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. No deviations were found.",
