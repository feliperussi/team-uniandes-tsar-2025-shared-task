The text is a model of A2-level writing.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates exemplary adherence to A2 standards. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple declarative sentences. The simplification of the B1 structure 'Suzanne says that the two things start to merge' to the A2-compliant 'Suzanne says the two ideas mixed' is a perfect execution.
