The output introduces a lengthy definition of 'civilisation' that, while simplifying the term, shifts the focus from the original text's emphasis on the *evidence* of early human civilisation and the *mystery* of its connection to language. The original's nuance of 'humans did become more complex and more intelligent' is also simplified to 'people became more clever. They could do more difficult things,' which loses some of the cognitive depth implied by 'complex'. This dilution of the core message is the reason for the low MeaningBERT score. Suggestion: Focus on directly rephrasing the original content without adding extensive definitions that were not part of the original's primary message. Ensure that the simplified language still conveys the full scope of the original concepts, such as 'complex' and 'intelligent'.",

Sentence Structure: The opening sentence 'From 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, we saw signs of early human civilisation.' is too long and contains too much information for a single A2 sentence. A2 requires shorter, simpler sentence structures. 3. Grammar: The 'how' clause in 'We do not know how this links to language.' can be a B1 structure. A2 typically relies on more basic conjunctions and sentence constructions. Suggestion: Replace 'civilisation' with simpler A2 terms or define it using A2 vocabulary. Split the first sentence into multiple, shorter A2-level sentences. Rephrase the 'how' clause using a simpler A2 structure.",

The core message of the original text, particularly regarding the emergence of 'early human civilisation' and humans becoming 'more complex', has been lost or significantly diluted in the simplified version. The original text emphasizes the development of complex societies and behaviors, not just how people lived. The phrase 'We saw signs of how early people lived' is too general and does not convey the specific meaning of 'evidence of early human civilisation'. Similarly, 'But people became more clever and smart' simplifies 'yet humans did become more complex and more intelligent' by focusing only on intelligence and omitting the crucial concept of increasing complexity in their overall existence or societal structures. This loss of key conceptual meaning is unacceptable for an A2 simplification. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly include the idea of early human societies becoming more developed or organized, and people's lives becoming more intricate, not just their intelligence.",
