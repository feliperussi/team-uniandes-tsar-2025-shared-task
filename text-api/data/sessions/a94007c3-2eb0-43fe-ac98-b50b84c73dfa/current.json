    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards. It accurately preserves factual information and core meaning, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.7749 (above 0.75) and BERTScore of 0.924 (above 0.90). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been meticulously simplified, with complex terms like 'evidence', 'connection', 'suddenly', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'develop', and 'producing' replaced by appropriate A2 equivalents such as 'signs', 'link', 'quickly', 'clever', 'changed a lot', 'grow', and 'make'. The definition of 'civilisation' is clear and perfectly suited for an A2 learner. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using only A2-appropriate connectors like 'and', 'but', and 'or'. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
