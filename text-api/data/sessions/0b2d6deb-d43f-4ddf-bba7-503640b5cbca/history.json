Key original concepts like 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', and 'pact' have been replaced with phrases like 'bad things', 'customers are very sad', and 'deal'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the specific meaning of the source material.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.743 is below the 0.75 minimum. The phrase 'customers are very sad' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'consumer backlash', which implies anger and protest, not just sadness.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'waste' is used in 'They waste a lot of food' and 'plastic waste'. This word is not compliant with the A2 standard. It must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning with A2 vocabulary. Change 'bad things' to 'do things that are not right'. Change 'customers are very sad' to 'customers are angry and complain'. Replace the verb 'waste' with 'throw away'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because specific B1/B2 concepts were replaced with overly generic A2 phrases, losing important lexical detail. For example, 'unethical acts' was replaced with 'wrong things' and 'consumer backlash' became 'customers are angry'. This simplification is too aggressive and loses fidelity to the source text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, which is an instant failure. The analysis shows this is due to the use of unapproved B1 vocabulary. The word 'waste' is a B1 word and was used twice. The words 'accusations' and 'pact' are also above the A2 level.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'waste' with an A2 equivalent like 'rubbish' or 'things people throw away'.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace 'accusations' with a simple A2 phrase like 'people say they did'.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace 'pact' with 'agreement' or 'promise'.",
