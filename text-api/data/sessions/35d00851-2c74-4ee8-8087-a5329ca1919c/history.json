This confirms meaning and key terms were retained.\n- CEFR Classification: The text was correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structure is simple, using short sentences and basic connectors. The original text's list-based sentence ('learned to keep quiet, stay out of trouble and how to open car doors...') was correctly broken down into three separate, simple sentences, which is an exemplary A2 simplification technique.
