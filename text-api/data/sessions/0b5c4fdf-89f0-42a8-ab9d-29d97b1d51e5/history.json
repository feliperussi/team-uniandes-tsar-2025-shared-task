The main reason for the incorrect classification is the new sentence added to define methane: 'Methane, which is a simple gas made of carbon and hydrogen, is a component of natural gas.' This sentence introduced several words above the B1 level, including 'component' (B2), 'carbon' (B2), and 'hydrogen' (C1). Additionally, the word 'characteristic' (B2) was retained from the original text. To correct this, the definition of methane must use simpler language. Suggestion: Replace the definition with 'Methane is a simple gas. It is an important part of the natural gas we use on Earth.' Also, simplify 'One characteristic of' to 'One important thing about'.

The inclusion of very short sentences like 'Methane is a simple gas.' also contributed to the lower classification.

The reason for this is the addition of the final sentence: 'Methane is a colourless gas made of carbon and hydrogen.' This sentence, which was not in the original text, introduces advanced vocabulary such as 'carbon' (B2) and 'hydrogen' (C1), making the text too complex for the B1 level. While attempting to define the keyword 'methane', this addition violates the principle of not introducing new information and fails the CEFR requirement. Suggestion: Remove this final sentence entirely. The existing description of methane as a 'basic organic molecule' and 'key ingredient of natural gas' is sufficient for the target audience.",

While the output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, it fails its primary simplification goal. The primary issue is sentence complexity. The first sentence, 'The rover analyses the air around it periodically, and in 2014 it detected a basic organic molecule, methane (a simple hydrocarbon gas), which is a key component of natural gas and only survives a few hundred years,' is very long and combines multiple ideas using complex clauses. This structure is characteristic of a C1 level. Additionally, the simplification introduced B2-level vocabulary such as 'component' and 'concentration' where simpler alternatives existed in the original text ('ingredient', 'level'). The use of the subjunctive mood in 'as if the planet were breathing' is also a more advanced grammatical form. Suggestion: Break the first long sentence into two or three shorter sentences. For example: 'In 2014, the rover found a basic organic molecule called methane. Methane is a key part of natural gas and only survives for a few hundred years.' Also, replace 'concentration' with 'level' to better align with B1 standards.",
