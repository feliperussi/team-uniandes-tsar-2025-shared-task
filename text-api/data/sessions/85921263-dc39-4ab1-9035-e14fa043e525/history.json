No information has been distorted.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics are above the required thresholds (MeaningBERT: 0.8471, BERTScore: 0.9105), indicating the core message and key terms have been preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms this.\n- Vocabulary Audit: Vocabulary is strictly controlled and appropriate for the A2 level. The word 'making' is flagged as B2 but is contextually acceptable as a present participle of the A1 verb 'make'.\n- Structural Analysis: The use of short, simple sentences is exemplary. Complex ideas are broken down into manageable units using appropriate A2 connectors ('So', 'Or', 'But'). The text is a model of A2 simplification.",
