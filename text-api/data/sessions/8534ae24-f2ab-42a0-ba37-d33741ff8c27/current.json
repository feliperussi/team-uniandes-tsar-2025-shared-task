    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards while preserving factual integrity and meaning. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8491 and BERTScore of 0.9027 confirm excellent fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The writer effectively simplified complex sentence structures from the original text into short, clear sentences, which is crucial for A2 comprehension. Vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with no inappropriate B1 or higher words detected. Connectors are limited to 'but' and 'and', which are appropriate for A2. The breakdown of the original's single long sentence into multiple simple sentences is a strong demonstration of A2 simplification.",
