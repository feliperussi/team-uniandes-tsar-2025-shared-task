This omission fundamentally changes the meaning of the text. The concept of the 'final girl' is defined by her being the sole survivor. Without this information, the text is factually incorrect and misrepresents the source material. While the simplification of vocabulary and sentence structure is adequate, it cannot compensate for a core factual error. Suggestion: You must include the fact that all other characters die. Re-insert a simple sentence like 'In the end, only one girl is alive.' after 'It starts with a group of young people having fun.'",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Loss: Key descriptive phrases were oversimplified, causing the fidelity score to drop. The original's 'most resourceful person in the world' was reduced to 'very clever', losing the original's emphasis and detail. The specific term 'teenagers' was replaced with the more general 'young people'.\n\n- Grammatical Error: A critical error exists in the fourth sentence: 'At the girl is usually good and shy.' The phrase 'At the beginning' from the original text was omitted, making the sentence grammatically incorrect and nonsensical.\n\n- Structural Simplification: While aiming for A2, the text broke down complex ideas into too many short, disconnected sentences, which also contributed to the loss of fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the grammatical error by reinserting 'At the beginning'. Rephrase to restore more specific vocabulary from the original text to meet the fidelity requirement. For example, combine 'the girl is strong' and 'She is also very clever' into a sentence that better reflects the original's meaning of 'resourceful'.",
