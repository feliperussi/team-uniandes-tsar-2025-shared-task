It adheres to all protocol requirements without deviation.\n\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually correct and preserves the core message of the original text.\n\nMetrics Compliance: All metrics are within the required thresholds. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8125 and BERTScore of 0.9002 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR classifier result is correctly A2.\n\nQualitative Audit: The text passes a strict qualitative review. Vocabulary is confined to the A1/A2 levels. Complex concepts such as 'clich\u00e9' and 'resourceful' were correctly simplified to 'common story' and 'clever'. Sentence structure is exemplary for the A2 level, consisting of short, simple declarative sentences. No violations were detected.",
