The simplification of other concepts like 'civilisation' to 'people living together' and 'complex' to 'not simple' was effective, but the inclusion of a single B1 word results in an immediate failure. The text is not exclusively A2."

Sentence structures are simple and direct. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. No corrections are necessary."
