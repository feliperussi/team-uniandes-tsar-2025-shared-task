The original text presents a contrast between creating dreams (lucid dreaming) and interpreting them ('working out the meaning'). Your version completely removes this essential contrast, which is a failure to preserve the core message.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original states 'instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them'. Your text omits the concept of 'creating' dreams and the contrast with 'interpreting' them. This is a critical omission.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'And you can make decisions that affect what happens in the dream' uses a relative clause ('that affect...') which pushes the complexity towards B1. A simpler A2 structure is required.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. First, explain that in lucid dreams you can create the story. Then, separately state that you may still want some normal dreams so your subconscious can talk to you. Simplify the complex sentence. For example: 'You can make decisions. These decisions change what happens in the dream.'",

This is an unacceptable loss of information.\n- Meaning Dilution: Key concepts were oversimplified to the point of losing their meaning. 'direct the plot like a film director' was reduced to 'create the story', losing the specific idea of control. 'subconscious' was reduced to 'mind', which is not an equivalent concept.\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is broken into too many short, choppy sentences. This damages the logical flow of the original message.\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. You must include the idea that writing down dreams is a way to achieve lucid dreaming. Combine some of the short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so'. Restore the specific meaning of 'controlling' the dream, not just creating it.",

Your version, 'your mind can show thoughts', is a vague simplification that loses this specific and important concept.\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key original phrases like 'subconscious', 'direct the plot', and 'affect the events'. These must be represented with simpler, but equivalent, A2 phrasing.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is B2 level. It is not permitted. An A2 text cannot contain B2 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the definition of lucid dreaming to avoid the word 'means'. For example: 'In lucid dreaming, you know you are dreaming.' Restore the lost meaning of the final sentence. Change 'your mind can show thoughts' to 'your mind can tell you important things'.",
