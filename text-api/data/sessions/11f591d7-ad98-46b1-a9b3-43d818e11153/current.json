    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7294 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8758 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and specific vocabulary.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains that the subconscious can tell you what is on your mind. Your version, 'your mind can show thoughts', is a vague simplification that loses this specific and important concept.\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key original phrases like 'subconscious', 'direct the plot', and 'affect the events'. These must be represented with simpler, but equivalent, A2 phrasing.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is B2 level. It is not permitted. An A2 text cannot contain B2 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the definition of lucid dreaming to avoid the word 'means'. For example: 'In lucid dreaming, you know you are dreaming.' Restore the lost meaning of the final sentence. Change 'your mind can show thoughts' to 'your mind can tell you important things'.",
