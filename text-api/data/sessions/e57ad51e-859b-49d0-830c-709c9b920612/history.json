The original text conveys a formal recommendation for adopting a 'people-oriented management style' based on 'findings' to 'contribute to creating a positive environment'. Your version simplifies this to 'We looked at the facts. We say Girox Foods needs a better way to lead people.' and 'This can help make a good place to work. Then workers can do their best work.'. This simplification loses the nuance of a strategic management style recommendation and the formal basis of the findings, reducing the core message to a list of actions rather than a strategic shift. The BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. For example, 'people-oriented management style' was replaced with 'better way to lead people', 'flexible working hours' with 'easy-to-change work times', 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with 'say \"thank you\"', and 'professional development' with 'worker learning'. These replacements, while simpler, remove too much lexical detail from the original text, impacting fidelity. Suggestion: Retain more of the original's specific terminology where possible, even if simplified. For instance, 'people-oriented management style' could be 'a way to lead people that cares about them'. Ensure the 'recommendation' aspect is clearer. Do not oversimplify key concepts to the point of losing their specific meaning.",

The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, as indicated by both the MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics. Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5798 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a loss of the original's nuanced and formal message. The phrase 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' was simplified to 'new way to lead people... This way cares about people', losing the strategic and systemic implication of 'management style'. The phrase 'explore ways of offering' was reduced to a direct command 'should give', altering the tone and implied process of consideration.

The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, falling below the required thresholds for both MeaningBERT and BERTScore.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.572 is significantly below the required 0.75. The overall simplification of concepts like 'people-oriented management style' to 'This way cares about people' and 'Increased investment in professional development' to 'spend more money on training for workers' dilutes the original professional and strategic meaning. The nuance of 'management style' and 'investment' is lost.\n2.  Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8986 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. For example, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' was rephrased extensively, losing the specific term 'management style'. 'Challenge our staff' was simplified to 'give workers interesting work', losing the concept of 'challenge'. 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' was reduced to 'say good things about their work. They should show they value the work', losing the specific terms 'reinforcement' and 'recognition'.\n3.  Vocabulary Simplification (Excessive): While simplification is required for A2, the extent of rephrasing for terms like 'people-oriented management style', 'challenge our staff', 'positive reinforcement and recognition', 'professional development', and 'social and intercultural communication' resulted in a loss of specific meaning and lexical detail, contributing to the low BERTScore.\n\nCorrective Path:\n1.  Restore the core meaning of 'management style' more accurately. For example, 'a way of leading that focuses on people'.\n2.  Ensure the concept of 'challenging staff' is conveyed more directly, perhaps as 'give workers hard but good tasks'.\n3.  Rephrase 'positive reinforcement and recognition' to retain more of its original meaning, such as 'praise their good work and show they see it'.\n4.  Use slightly more precise A2 vocabulary to maintain fidelity without exceeding the A2 level. For instance, 'professional development' could be 'training for their jobs'.",

The simplified text loses the formal, advisory tone and the nuanced strategic recommendations of the original. For instance, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is a strategic action, while 'This style puts people first' is a descriptive statement, losing the active recommendation. The original's emphasis on 'explore ways of offering' and 'consider how we can enable' is replaced by direct commands, losing the sense of investigation and careful planning. The overall cohesive and advisory nature of the original report is diminished. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8921 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Examples include replacing 'On the basis of these findings' with 'We looked at our study results', losing the specific terms 'basis' and 'findings'. 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' was broken down, losing the original lexical units. Similarly, 'social and intercultural communication' was rephrased, losing the specific adjectives 'social' and 'intercultural'. These lexical changes, while simplifying, resulted in too much deviation from the original's specific wording. Suggestion: Rephrase to better capture the original's advisory tone and the strategic nature of the recommendations. Ensure that key concepts, even when simplified, retain their original weight and nuance.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5827 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's core meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8903 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations: - The original text's nuance of 'explore ways of offering more flexible working hours' is reduced to a direct command 'The company should offer working hours that workers can choose.' This loses the exploratory aspect and alters the original intent. - The specific management concepts of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' are simplified to 'praise workers for their good work' and 'show they see workers' good work.' This dilutes the original's precise terminology. - The causal connection in 'could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work' is fragmented into two separate, less connected sentences: 'This can also help make a good work environment. This helps workers do their best work.' This breaks the logical flow and weakens the original meaning. - The formal opening 'On the basis of these findings, we recommend...' is overly simplified to 'Our study found these things. We recommend...' This loses the formal and logical relationship between the findings and the recommendation. Corrective Path: - Restore the nuance of 'exploring ways' for flexible hours. Do not convert it into a direct command. - Reintroduce the specific concepts of 'positive reinforcement' and 'recognition' using appropriate A2 vocabulary, rather than generic 'praise.' - Reconstruct the sentence about the environment and best work to maintain the causal connection. Do not fragment it. - Rephrase the opening to clearly link the findings to the recommendation, even with simpler language.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, indicating an insufficient understanding of the source material's nuances. This is a critical failure at Priority 2 of the diagnostic protocol. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6008 is significantly below the required 0.75. The simplification has diluted the professional and strategic intent of the original. For example, 'professional development' is reduced to 'training helps workers get better at their jobs', losing the broader concept of career growth. 'Social and intercultural communication' is simplified to 'talk well with other people' and 'talk well with people from other countries', which loses the specific skill-based and formal aspect of 'communication'. The original's emphasis on 'positive reinforcement and recognition' is also weakened.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8995 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Important terms such as 'adopt', 'people-oriented', 'explore', 'enable', 'variety', 'challenge', 'positive reinforcement', 'recognition', 'increased investment', 'professional development', 'social and intercultural communication', and 'contribute' have been replaced with less precise or overly simplified vocabulary, diminishing the lexical richness and accuracy of the output.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (Secondary): The CEFR classifier rated the output as B1, not A2. While not the primary failure, this indicates the text is still too complex for the target A2 audience. This is likely due to the remaining complexity in sentence structures or vocabulary that, despite simplification attempts, still exceed A2 limits. For example, 'This training should help workers talk well with other people. It should help them talk well with people from other countries.' could be simplified further to combine ideas more directly for A2.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Re-evaluate the original text to ensure all core concepts, especially the professional and strategic implications, are fully understood before simplification.\n- Focus on preserving the specific meaning of terms like 'professional development' and 'intercultural communication' with simpler A2 vocabulary, rather than just describing their outcome.\n- Ensure that all key terms from the original are represented in the A2 version, even if simplified, to meet the BERTScore threshold. Do not omit or drastically alter core concepts.\n- Review the text for any remaining B1 structures or vocabulary that caused the CEFR classifier to rate it as B1. Break down longer sentences and replace any non-A2 words.",
