This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary error is a change in meaning from 'reduce' to 'stop'. The original text states that better designs can 'reduce these terrible accidents'. Your version states they can 'stop these very bad accidents'. To reduce something is to make it happen less. To stop something is to prevent it completely. This is a factual alteration.\n- The concept of 'impact' from the original text ('velocity of the impact') was lost. Your version, 'It hits the bridge very fast', simplifies the idea but loses a key semantic component.\n- The scientific term 'mass' was replaced with 'big and heavy'. While an acceptable simplification for A2, this contributes to the overall loss of semantic fidelity detected by the metric.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the original meaning. Change the final sentence. The goal is to 'reduce' accidents, not 'stop' them. Rephrase to 'These things can help make these bad accidents happen less often'.",
