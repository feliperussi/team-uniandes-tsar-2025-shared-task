    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous to Earth. We call them 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). This is because they fly very close to us, less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them is a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to watch these rocks. It can say if an asteroid is going to hit Earth. If an asteroid is a danger, there are two ways to keep our world safe.",

    "feedback": "The text is an exemplary model of A2 writing. It successfully simplifies complex concepts using high-frequency vocabulary and simple, declarative sentences. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. The replacement of 'track' with 'watch' and 'defence solutions' with 'ways to keep our world safe' is excellent. No violations of the A2 standard were found.",
