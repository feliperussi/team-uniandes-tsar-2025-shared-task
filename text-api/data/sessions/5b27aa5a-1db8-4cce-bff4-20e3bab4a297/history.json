Adherence to the A2 wordlist is non-negotiable.\n\n- Deviation 1: The word 'issues' is B1 level. It is too complex for an A2 reader.\n- Deviation 2: The word 'residents' is B1 level. This word is not on the standard A2 list.\n- Deviation 3: The word 'homelessness' is a B1 abstract noun. This concept must be expressed in simpler terms.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'social issues' with 'social problems'. Replace 'residents' with 'people who live there'. Rephrase the final sentence to avoid the word 'homelessness', for example: 'He hopes people think about the problem of having no home'.",

No information has been distorted or omitted.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2. Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels, as confirmed by the provided word list. Sentence structures are simple and direct.\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8553 and BERTScore of 0.9186 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- Qualitative Analysis: The simplification of complex ideas is exemplary. For instance, converting 'to encourage residents to think about the problem of homelessness' into two simpler sentences ('He paints homeless people in big cities. He hopes people who live there think about having no home.') is a perfect execution of A2 simplification principles. The text is a model of A2 compliance.",
