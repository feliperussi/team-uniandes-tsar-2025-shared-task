While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning (MeaningBERT score of 0.94), it fails the core task of simplification due to overly complex sentence structures and the retention of high-level vocabulary.\n\nLinguistic Diagnosis:\n1.  **Sentence Complexity:** The output consists of two very long sentences with multiple clauses. The second sentence, 'Although human brains did not suddenly get bigger during this period, people became more complex and intelligent, which creates a puzzle about whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language,' is too syntactically complex for a B1 reader.\n2.  **Vocabulary:** The B2 word 'civilization' and the C1 word 'remains' were not simplified as required by the vocabulary candidates list.\n\nActionable Suggestions:\n*   **Simplify Sentences:** Break the complex sentences into shorter ones. For instance, the second sentence could be rewritten as: 'Human brains did not get bigger during this time. However, people became more complex and intelligent. This creates a puzzle. Did language cause their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?'\n*   **Replace Vocabulary:** Substitute 'civilization' with a B1-friendly term like 'society' or 'way of life'.

The sentence structures are clear but simple, and the vocabulary mix, while appropriate, was not sufficient to push the classification to B1. To improve, consider introducing more B1-level grammatical structures. For example, the final two sentences could be combined: 'Although brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent, which raises the question of whether using language caused their brains to develop or if their more complex brains started to produce it.'

While the simplification is excellent in many ways, it is too simple for the target audience.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\n1.  **CEFR Mismatch:** The text was likely classified as A2 because, despite using B1 vocabulary ('complex', 'connection', 'unknown'), the sentence structures are very direct and lack the complexity expected at a B1 level. The text is oversimplified.\n2.  **Factual Integrity & Meaning Preservation:** The output is exemplary in these areas. It passed the Factual Integrity check perfectly. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 is exceptionally high, confirming that the core message was preserved with great accuracy.\n\nACTIONABLE SUGGESTION:\nTo elevate the text to the target B1 level, consider combining sentences to create slightly more complex structures. For example, the first two sentences could be joined: \"Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, the first evidence of early human civilisation appeared, including things like cave paintings, although its connection to language remains unknown.\" This uses a B1-level subordinator ('although') and creates a sentence structure more typical of the target level without sacrificing clarity."
