She hunts in the woods around her home, District 12, with her friend Gale and becomes skilled with a bow and arrow. When her younger sister, Prim, is chosen as a tribute, which is a person who is chosen to participate in a dangerous competition, Katniss volunteers to go instead. The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, and Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with him.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent submission that passes all evaluation criteria. Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.97) confirm that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification is very well executed. The key term 'tribute' was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence, which is a model example of how to handle keyword definitions. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'heroine' to 'main character' and 'very skilful' to 'skilled', are appropriate for the B1 level and improve readability without losing meaning. The overall structure is clear and fluent.",
