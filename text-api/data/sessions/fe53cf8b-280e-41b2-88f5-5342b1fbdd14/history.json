        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the target 'B1' level, indicating over-simplification. While factual integrity and meaning preservation were excellent (MeaningBERT 0.83, BERTScore 0.97), the simplification was too aggressive. The primary cause is likely the replacement of B2-level vocabulary like 'skilful' with the very simple A1 phrase 'very good'. Additionally, while correctly defining the keyword 'tribute', the definition itself ('a person who has to fight in a dangerous game') uses A2-level language. Suggestion: To reach the B1 target, use slightly more advanced synonyms. For instance, 'skilful' could become 'skilled'. The definition for 'tribute' could be rephrased to 'a person who is chosen to participate in a dangerous competition'.",

Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.97) confirm that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification is very well executed. The key term 'tribute' was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence, which is a model example of how to handle keyword definitions. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'heroine' to 'main character' and 'very skilful' to 'skilled', are appropriate for the B1 level and improve readability without losing meaning. The overall structure is clear and fluent.",
