All key information, including the timeframe and the biological function, is preserved.\n\nMetric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.91 and BERTScore of 0.94 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key vocabulary were successfully retained.\n\nCEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, demonstrating perfect alignment with the target readability level.\n\nQualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Complex sentences from the original were broken down into short, clear statements. Vocabulary is strictly controlled, with the B2-level word 'gene' correctly identified as a keyword requiring definition. Sentence structure is simple and direct. No deviations were found.",
