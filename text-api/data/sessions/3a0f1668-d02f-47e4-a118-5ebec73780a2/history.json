The meaning is factually close but semantically distant.\n*   Loss of Formality: The original text mentions a 'policy' from the 'city council'. Your text simplifies this to a 'plan' from 'the city'.

However, the failure to preserve the semantic weight of the original message is a critical error.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6852 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is a critical failure. The original text describes a formal policy enacted by a city council to solve a specific problem. Your output over-simplifies this to the point where the core meaning of a structured, official response is lost. The phrase 'the city has a plan' does not carry the same weight or meaning as 'the city council has employed a team'.\n\n- Diagnostic Point 1: The simplification has damaged the logical structure. The original text links the problem (danger to baboons, human conflict) directly to the solution (employing monitors). Your version breaks this into a series of simple, disconnected statements ('The city wants to save them. It also wants to stop problems. So, the city has a plan.'), which weakens the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n- Diagnostic Point 2: While the BERTScore of 0.9012 and the A2 CEFR classification are technically compliant, they are irrelevant due to the primary failure in meaning preservation. The text is simple, but it is not an accurate representation of the original message's intent.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the concept of an official city action. Combine the fragmented sentences to restore the logical link between the problem and the solution. For example: 'To save the baboons and stop problems with people, the city now has a team to help.' This is still A2 level but better reflects the original meaning.",

The original text is making a formal statement about the conservation status of the animals.\n- Loss of Nuance: The phrase 'minimise conflicts' was simplified to 'stop problems'. 'Minimise' means to reduce, not to stop completely.

Rephrase 'endangered species' to 'an endangered animal. This means there are not many left in the world.' This defines the term while preserving it.
