    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6661 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text breaks down complex ideas into simple statements but loses the causal links between them. The original states the team was employed 'to save them and minimise conflicts'. Your version, 'The city has a team to help the baboons. This team works to save them. It also stops problems...', describes actions but fails to communicate the original purpose and intent.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The B2-level word 'means' was used in the sentence 'This means there are not many left in the world.' This is an unacceptable vocabulary choice for the A2 level.\n- Structural Issue: The text is excessively fragmented. While short sentences are required for A2, the degree of separation here damages the logical flow and contributes to the low meaning preservation score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore cause-and-effect relationships. Combine sentences where appropriate using A2 connectors like 'because'. For example, write 'The city has a team to save the baboons and to stop problems between them and people.' Remove the word 'means' and state the definition directly: 'Baboons are an endangered animal. There are not many left in the world.'",
