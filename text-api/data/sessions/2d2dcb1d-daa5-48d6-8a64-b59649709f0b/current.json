    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8978 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, compromising its fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text retains the C1 word 'threshold'. This is unacceptable for the A2 level.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text retains the B1 word 'challenge'. This is unacceptable for the A2 level.\n- Lexical Loss: The original text specifies 'the robots R2D2 and C3PO'. Your version omits the word 'robots', which is a loss of factual detail and contributes to the low fidelity score.\n- Structural Deviation: The complete restructuring of the text into two separate paragraphs, while attempting simplification, created too much distance from the original phrasing, causing the fidelity metric to fail.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the word 'robots' to the text. Replace 'threshold' with a simple A2 phrase like 'the entrance to the new world'. Replace 'challenge' with an A2 phrase like 'biggest problem' or 'hardest fight'. Re-integrate the examples into the main description to improve fidelity to the source text's structure.",
