The core message was lost.\n- The primary failure is a loss of meaning. The original text explains a specific theory from a person named Campbell, using a story as an example. Your version separates the character definitions from the story description, which breaks the logical flow and loses the central point that this is Campbell's analysis.\n- The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8482 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing all key phrases from the original ('refuses the call to adventure', 'cross the threshold', 'special world') with generic, simpler terms ('says no', 'start the adventure', 'new place'). This simplification was too aggressive and sacrificed fidelity.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The definition 'Obi-Wan is a wise teacher' uses the B1-level word 'wise'. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original's structure. State that Campbell describes a pattern, then use the story of Luke to show that pattern. Do not separate the definitions. Remove the B1 word 'wise' and replace it with an A2 phrase like 'a teacher who knows many things'.",

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.

These are not A2 vocabulary. Their use is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n- Grammar Violation: The sentence 'Obi\u2011Wan is a teacher who knows many things' uses a relative clause ('who...').

Replace 'mentor' with 'a wise helper' or 'an old teacher'. Replace 'threshold' with 'the door' or 'the start'. Replace 'enemy' with 'a bad person'.\n- Suggestion: Split the complex sentence.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8528, which is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text establishes a cause-and-effect relationship: the mentor appears, helps the hero, and as a result, the hero decides to 'cross the threshold'. Your version presents these as disconnected events: 'Then an old teacher appears. The hero meets the old teacher. The hero decides to go across the door.' This fragmentation destroys the logical connection.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: The phrase 'cross the threshold' is a key concept. Your replacement, 'go across the door', is a literal and nonsensical simplification that loses the intended metaphorical meaning.\n\n- Concept Dilution: The original specifies the hero prepares for their 'biggest challenge'. Your version weakens this to 'a final test', which is not equivalent and loses the sense of scale and importance.\n\n- Over-simplification: The text has been broken down into sentences that are too simple, resembling an A1 level. This excessive simplification is the root cause of the low meaning and fidelity scores.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write to connect the ideas using simple A2 connectors like 'so' and 'because'. Restore the cause-and-effect logic. Do not replace key conceptual phrases like 'cross the threshold' with overly literal and inaccurate simplifications; instead, explain them simply if needed or use a closer A2 equivalent like 'enter the new world'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Lost: Key phrases were oversimplified, destroying their specific meaning. 'Refuses the call to adventure' became 'says no to the call'. 'Cross the threshold' became 'cross the entrance'. This level of simplification is unacceptable and damages the text's fidelity.\n\n- Structural Disconnection: The original text connects ideas. For example, it lists 'Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO' as friends. Your output separates them into disconnected facts: 'Han Solo is a friend. R2D2 is a robot. C3PO is a robot.' This loses the explicit relationship that they are all friends of the hero.\n\n- Overly Simplistic Structure: The text is a list of short, disconnected sentences. This is below the A2 standard, which requires the use of simple connectors to link ideas. The original uses 'but' to show contrast; your text uses 'Then', which only shows sequence and loses the original meaning.\n\n- Added Information: You added unrequested information such as 'Luke is a young man' and 'Death Star is a big space station'. While simple, this is not a simplification of the original text; it is an addition of new facts, which is not the task.\n\nSuggestion: Retain more of the original vocabulary. Combine sentences using A2 connectors like 'and' and 'but' to restore the logical flow. Do not add information that was not present in the source text. Ensure relationships between characters, places, and actions are explicitly stated as they are in the original.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, failing to maintain lexical fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The text uses multiple words that are above the A2 level. This is a critical failure. The following words must be replaced with A2 alternatives: 'mentor' (C1), 'threshold' (C1), 'enemy' (B1), 'challenge' (B1).\n\n- Structural Defect: The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. While A2 requires simplicity, this level of separation damages the logical flow of the original paragraph.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error regarding R2D2 immediately. Replace all B1 and C1 vocabulary with A2-level words or simple definitions. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to improve readability without increasing complexity.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7271 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8955 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's key concept 'call to adventure' was reduced to 'the call'. The word 'adventure' is central to the meaning and its removal is a critical error.\n- Fidelity Loss: The specific term 'cross the threshold' was replaced with 'cross the first step'. This simplification loses the specific, important meaning from the source material.\n- Phrasing Degradation: The phrase 'biggest challenge' was rephrased to 'biggest hard test'. This is unnatural and poor phrasing, even for A2 level.\n- Structural Disconnection: The original text connects the enemy and the location with 'the enemy is Darth Vader inside the special world of the Death Star'. Your version splits this into two separate sentences, losing the direct relationship.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Restore the key noun 'adventure'. The phrase must be 'call to adventure'.\n- Rephrase the concept of 'threshold' without losing its meaning. Suggestion: '...helps the hero go into the new world for the first time.'\n- Use natural A2 phrasing. Replace 'biggest hard test' with 'biggest challenge' or 'most difficult test'.\n- Combine the sentences about the enemy and the location to restore the original's direct link.
