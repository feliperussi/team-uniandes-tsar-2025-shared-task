The core message and nuance of the original text have been lost in simplification. Specific issues include: 1. The original phrase 'the world's press has been full of reports of wild animals coming into cities in bigger and bigger numbers' conveys a sense of widespread, increasing, and significant phenomenon. Your version 'Newspapers write many stories about this. More and more animals come.' significantly weakens this meaning. 'Many stories' is less impactful than 'full of reports', and 'More and more animals come' lacks the emphasis of 'bigger and bigger numbers'. 2. The original question 'Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest?' explores a nuanced societal perception. Your simplification 'Do people like them? Or are they a bad thing?' loses the specific concepts of 'welcome' and 'considered a danger or a pest', replacing them with a generic 'bad thing'. This diminishes the depth of the original inquiry. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentences to more accurately reflect the scale and specific questions posed in the original text, ensuring that key concepts like 'full of reports', 'bigger and bigger numbers', 'welcome', and 'considered a danger or a pest' are conveyed, even if simplified to A2 vocabulary.",

For example, the original sentence 'Small animals like birds, squirrels, mice and insects are a common sight in many cities and towns' conveys a single, connected idea. Your version 'Small animals live in cities. You see them often. Like birds, squirrels, mice, and insects.' breaks this into three separate statements, diluting the direct connection between the animals and their common visibility. Similarly, the original's 'the world's press has been full of reports of wild animals coming into cities in bigger and bigger numbers' describes a single reported trend. Your version 'more big wild animals come to cities. Their numbers are growing. Many newspapers all over the world write a lot about this.' separates these elements, losing the implied connection that the newspapers are reporting on the growing numbers. This approach, while simplifying sentence structure, has inadvertently diminished the overall coherence and the nuanced meaning of the original text.
