This indicates a significant loss of lexical detail and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (BERTScore): The text was over-simplified into excessively short, disconnected sentences. This fragmentation destroyed the syntactical relationship between concepts present in the original, causing the fidelity score to drop. The original's clause 'the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active while the part that controls emotions becomes more active' was broken apart, losing the direct comparative link.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (CEFR Compliance): The text also fails the CEFR compliance check. The provided classifier result is 'B1', which is above the target 'A2' level. This is a critical failure to meet the required standard.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. While simplification is necessary, it cannot come at the cost of fidelity. Recombine sentences to restore the logical flow and phrasing of the original text. For example, connect the ideas about the language and emotion parts of the brain using a simple A2 connector like 'but'. This will improve the BERTScore. You must also analyze and simplify the text to ensure it meets the A2 classification, not B1.",
