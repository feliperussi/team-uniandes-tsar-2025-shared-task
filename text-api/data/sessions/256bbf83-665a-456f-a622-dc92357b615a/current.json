    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8858 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check. CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The cause is the use of the C1-level word 'symbolic'. This word is too advanced for the A2 level. Vocabulary Violation: The word 'symbolic' is C1 level. It must be removed and replaced with an A2 concept. Fidelity Loss: The original text states the brain 'controls language' and 'controls emotions'. Your version, 'is for language' and 'is for feelings', is too simple and loses the specific meaning of control, contributing to the low BERTScore. Suggestion: Replace the sentence 'Dreams have symbolic meaning.' with 'In dreams, things can mean something else.' Rephrase 'is for language' to 'is the part that controls language' to restore the original meaning and improve fidelity.",
