    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed with unwavering adherence to the CEFR A2 standard. Factual integrity is maintained without deviation. Meaning preservation is robust, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.827, exceeding the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original text's key information is strong, evidenced by a BERTScore of 0.92, surpassing the 0.90 requirement. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the text as A2, confirming appropriate linguistic complexity. Vocabulary is strictly A2 or simpler. The term 'disabilities' was effectively simplified to 'people who have problems with their bodies', demonstrating precise A2-level rephrasing. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, employing A2-level connectors such as 'who' and 'also' without introducing B1 complexity. No deviations from the rigorous A2 standard were detected.",
