While the core meaning is largely preserved, the lexical choices deviate too much from the source material, impacting fidelity. Specific deviations include: The phrase 'multi-adventurer' was replaced with 'likes many adventures', losing the specific lexical item. The phrase 'through the deserts of Morocco' was changed to 'in the Morocco desert'. The phrase 'kayaked through the Grand Canyon' was rephrased as 'went kayaking in the big Grand Canyon', adding 'big' and changing the verb structure. The adverb 'Amazingly' was converted into a full sentence 'It is amazing.', altering the grammatical structure and lexical form. The entire phrase 'Apart from his travels' was omitted from the output. The concept of 'encourage people with disabilities to live active lives' was simplified to 'He also helps people with disabilities. He wants them to move a lot.', losing the specific terms 'encourage' and 'active lives'. The phrase 'groups of young blind people on climbing expeditions' was changed to 'young people who cannot see on climbing trips', omitting 'groups of' and replacing 'expeditions' with 'trips'. These cumulative lexical changes and omissions are the direct cause of the BERTScore falling below the required threshold. Suggestion: Maintain closer lexical fidelity to the original text where possible, especially for key nouns and verbs, while still simplifying sentence structure. Do not omit factual phrases unless absolutely necessary for A2 simplification.",

The presence of B1 and B2 vocabulary is a direct violation of the A2 readability requirement. Specific deviations include: 1. The word 'disability' is classified as B2. While a definition is provided, the word itself is used twice in the main text ('helps people with disabilities'). For A2, simpler phrasing like 'people who cannot see or hear well' or 'people with problems with their body' should be used consistently. 2. 'multi-adventurer' is a complex compound noun. 'Adventurer' is B1/B2. An A2 equivalent would be 'a person who does many exciting trips' or 'a person who likes many adventures'. 3. The verb 'kayaked' is B1. For A2, 'went in a kayak' or 'used a kayak' is more appropriate. 4. The adverb 'Amazingly' is B1. For A2, 'It is amazing that Erik cannot see' or simply removing the adverb would be better. 5. The connector 'Apart from' is B1. For A2, 'Also, he helps...' or 'He also helps...' should be used. 6. The word 'expeditions' is B1/B2. For A2, 'climbing trips' or 'trips to climb' is required. Suggestion: Systematically replace all identified B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A1/A2 equivalents. Rephrase sentences to avoid complex adverbs and connectors.",

The presence of B1 and B2 vocabulary is unacceptable. Specific deviations are as follows: - The word 'blind' is classified as B1. It is used in the sentence 'He became blind when he was 13.' This word must be replaced with A2-level phrasing such as 'cannot see'. - The word 'disability' is classified as B2. While it is the keyword being defined, the definition itself should avoid using the B2 term. The rule states 'Any unapproved B1/B2 word is a failure.' The presence of 'disability' in 'A 'disability' is when a part of your body or mind does not work well' is a direct violation. - The word 'Mount' (in 'Mount Everest') is classified as B2. Even as part of a proper noun, its presence violates the strict A2 vocabulary standard. Suggestion: Replace 'blind' with 'cannot see'. Rephrase the definition of 'disability' to avoid using the B2 word itself, for example, 'When a part of your body or mind does not work well, we call this a problem.'
