This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.

The original's focus on the scientific search for evidence is lost.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of over-simplification. Key terms that carry specific meaning were removed. 'Artefacts left by our ancestors' became 'old tools', and 'evolved the ability to create complex sounds' became 'could make many sounds'. This strips the text of necessary detail.\n\n- Vocabulary Error: The B1 word 'species' is used in the keyword definition. An A2-compliant definition must not rely on B1 vocabulary. The definition for 'evolutionary biologists' must be rephrased using only A1/A2 words.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the concept of 'ability' and the 'origin' of language.
