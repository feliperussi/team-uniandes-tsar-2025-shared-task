    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states there are 'very few physical clues' and that artefacts 'don't tell us what speech they were capable of making'. Your version incorrectly states 'Old artefacts give signs.' This is a direct contradiction and an instant failure.\n\nFAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6588 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. The core message has been lost.\n\nFAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8624 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and concepts from the original text.\n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is unacceptable.\n\nVocabulary Violation. The word 'used' is B1 level. It must be replaced. The sentence 'They think early people used simple sounds' is not A2 compliant.\n\nStructural Violation. Appending definitions to the end of the text is not a valid simplification method. The text itself must be comprehensible at the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text from the beginning. Ensure every fact aligns with the original source. Remove the contradictory sentence about artefacts. Replace the B1 word 'used'. Do not rely on a glossary; simplify the main text.",
