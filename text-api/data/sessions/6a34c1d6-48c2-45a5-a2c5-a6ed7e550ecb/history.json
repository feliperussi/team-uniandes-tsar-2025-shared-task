Your version, 'She wants them to feel strong and do sports', loses this critical context of challenging a negative societal belief. This is a severe deviation from the source's intent. Additional Deviations: Vocabulary Violation: The C1-level word 'spin' was used in the definition of 'hula hoop'. This word is too advanced for the A2 level and must be replaced. Factual Omission: The text fails to mention that Wasfia was the 'first' person to hula-hoop on the Seven Summits. This is a key detail from the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase the final paragraph to include the idea that her country makes it difficult for girls to do sports. Replace the word 'spin' with a simpler A2 phrase like 'move'. Restore the fact that she was the first person to perform this act.",

Your version, 'She wanted to play, but she could not', is factually correct but loses the important feeling of sadness and hesitation.\n- The original text states that her country 'discourages' women from doing sport. Your simplification, 'people tell girls that they should not do sport', is too weak. It does not capture the active pressure and societal barrier implied by 'discourage'.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.906 is acceptable, the low MeaningBERT score proves that keeping key words is not enough if the underlying concepts are weakened.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the sentence about her childhood to include the feeling of sadness, for example: 'She was sad because she could not play.'

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\nThe original text's central theme is empowerment as an act of defiance against societal discouragement. Your version dilutes this meaning.\n\n* The simplification of 'empower women' to 'give power to women' is too literal and loses the intended meaning of inspiring confidence and strength.\n* The simplification of a country which 'discourages' sport to 'society says girls should not do sports' weakens the concept. 'Discourage' implies active pressure, while your version is a passive statement of belief.\n* The emotional nuance of 'reluctantly stood by and watched' is lost. This word was key to showing her internal conflict and the societal pressure she felt as a child.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase 'give power to' with a concept like 'to show women they can be strong'. Rephrase 'society says' to better reflect active pressure, for example, 'society tells girls that sports are not for them'. Restore the emotional conflict by adding a phrase like 'she was sad she could not play'.",

A child from another country was playing with it. The child was visiting Wasfia's country, Bangladesh. Wasfia watched. She was sad because she could not play. In her country, people believed girls should not play with hula hoops. They also believed girls should not ride bikes.\nNow, Wasfia is a famous woman. She climbed the seven highest mountains in the world. For example, she climbed Everest and Kilimanjaro. Not many people have done this. She did something special on the top of each mountain. She was the first person to play with a hula hoop there.\nShe did this to show women and girls they can be strong. In Bangladesh, society tells girls that sports are not for them. Wasfia wants to change this idea.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6776 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary deviation is the dilution of the concept 'to empower women and girls'. Your version, 'to show women and girls they can be strong', is a weaker statement and loses the core semantic meaning. This is the main reason for the low metric score. A secondary deviation is that the concept of 'discouragement' was also weakened. The original's 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' implies a broad societal pressure that was lost in your simplification. While the text's structure and vocabulary are A2 compliant, this does not compensate for the critical failure to preserve meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase the final paragraph to restore the original's intent. Use A2 words that are closer in meaning to 'empower'. For example: 'She wants to help women and girls feel powerful'.",
