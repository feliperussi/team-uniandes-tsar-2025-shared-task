A child from another country was playing with it. The child was visiting Wasfia's country, Bangladesh. Wasfia watched. She was sad because she could not play. In her country, people believed girls should not play with hula hoops. They also believed girls should not ride bikes.\nNow, Wasfia is a famous woman. She climbed the seven highest mountains in the world. For example, she climbed Everest and Kilimanjaro. Not many people have done this. She did something special on the top of each mountain. She was the first person to play with a hula hoop there.\nShe did this to show women and girls they can be strong. In Bangladesh, society tells girls that sports are not for them. Wasfia wants to change this idea.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6776 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary deviation is the dilution of the concept 'to empower women and girls'. Your version, 'to show women and girls they can be strong', is a weaker statement and loses the core semantic meaning. This is the main reason for the low metric score. A secondary deviation is that the concept of 'discouragement' was also weakened. The original's 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' implies a broad societal pressure that was lost in your simplification. While the text's structure and vocabulary are A2 compliant, this does not compensate for the critical failure to preserve meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase the final paragraph to restore the original's intent. Use A2 words that are closer in meaning to 'empower'. For example: 'She wants to help women and girls feel powerful'.",
