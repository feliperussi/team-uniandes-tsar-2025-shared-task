    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' by the CEFR classifier, which is above the required 'B1' level. This indicates that the simplification was insufficient to meet the target complexity. The primary reasons for this classification are: 1. The first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see the evidence of early human civilisation, for example, through cave paintings; however, no one knows how this connects to language,' is quite long and uses a semicolon, which can be challenging for B1 learners. 2. Vocabulary such as 'civilisation' and 'intelligent' are typically considered B2 level. 3. The rhetorical question structure at the end, 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start producing language?', is also more advanced than typical B1 sentence structures. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into two, replacing B2 vocabulary with simpler B1 alternatives (e.g., 'society' or 'clever'), and rephrasing complex question forms into more direct statements or simpler questions.",
