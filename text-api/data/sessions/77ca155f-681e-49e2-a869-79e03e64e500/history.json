The original text states 'evidence of early human civilisation', which implies a structured society, culture, and advanced behaviors, supported by the example of cave paintings. The output simplifies this to 'signs of early human life'. 'Life' is a much broader and less specific term than 'civilisation' and misrepresents the level of human development being discussed. Cave paintings are evidence of early civilisation, not merely early life. This is a significant factual and semantic shift. To correct this, the phrase should retain the essence of 'civilisation' or a close synonym that conveys a similar level of societal development. For example, 'signs of early human culture' or 'early human societies'.\n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the required 'B1' level. While the simplification is clear, the sentence structures are consistently basic, and the vocabulary, despite the presence of a few B1 words like 'complex', is predominantly A1/A2. For instance, sentences like 'Brains did not suddenly get bigger, but humans became more complex and intelligent' are grammatically correct but structurally very simple. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs slightly more varied sentence structures, perhaps incorporating more subordinate clauses or a wider range of B1-level connectors beyond 'However' and 'but', while still maintaining clarity. For example, combining ideas with 'although' or 'whereas' could elevate the complexity without making it too difficult.",

While the meaning and factual integrity are well-preserved, the linguistic complexity of the output is too high for a B1 learner. For example, the first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see signs of early human civilisation, for example, through cave paintings; however, no one knows how this connects to language,' is quite long and uses a semicolon with 'however' to link two independent clauses. This structure is more typical of B2. Similarly, the final sentence, 'We do not know if using language made their brains develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language,' uses a complex 'if... or if...' structure within a single long sentence, which can be challenging for B1 learners. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into two or more shorter ones. For instance, the first sentence could be broken into: 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see signs of early human civilisation. For example, we saw cave paintings. But no one knows how this connects to language.' For the last sentence, you could simplify the structure: 'We do not know if language made their brains develop. Or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' Using simpler connectors like 'but' instead of 'however' can also help.",

For example, the original text's first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation, through cave paintings for example; no one knows the connection between this and language,' was split into three shorter, simpler sentences in the output: 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see signs of early human civilisation. For example, we saw cave paintings. But no one knows how this connects to language.' Additionally, the rhetorical questions in the original, 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start producing language?', were rephrased as simpler declarative statements of uncertainty: 'We do not know if language made their brains develop. Or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' To achieve a B1 level, consider maintaining some of the original sentence complexity or introducing B1-level connectors and vocabulary. For instance, the first sentence could be kept as a single, slightly longer sentence using a B1 connector like 'however' or 'although', or by retaining the semicolon structure. The rhetorical questions could also be maintained, as they are a common B1-level discourse feature. Ensure that while simplifying, the grammatical structures do not become overly basic, which can push the text down to A2.",

This indicates that the simplification was insufficient to meet the target complexity. The primary reasons for this classification are: 1. The first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see the evidence of early human civilisation, for example, through cave paintings; however, no one knows how this connects to language,' is quite long and uses a semicolon, which can be challenging for B1 learners. 2. Vocabulary such as 'civilisation' and 'intelligent' are typically considered B2 level. 3. The rhetorical question structure at the end, 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start producing language?', is also more advanced than typical B1 sentence structures. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into two, replacing B2 vocabulary with simpler B1 alternatives (e.g., 'society' or 'clever'), and rephrasing complex question forms into more direct statements or simpler questions.",
