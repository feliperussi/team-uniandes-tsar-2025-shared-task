It maintains factual integrity and preserves the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8266 and a BERTScore of 0.9307. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with appropriate simplifications like 'wet' for 'damp' and 'small stair' for 'narrow staircase'. Sentence structures are short and simple, using basic connectors such as 'or' and 'even if', which are suitable for the A2 level. The initial sentence 'A basement is a room under a house' provides a clear, simple definition for the keyword 'basement'.",
