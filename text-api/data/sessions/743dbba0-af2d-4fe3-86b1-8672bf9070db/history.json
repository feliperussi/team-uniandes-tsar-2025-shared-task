This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message. A secondary failure was detected in the BERTScore of 0.8923, which is below the minimum of 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text focuses on a specific engineering concept: designing bridges on ground resistant to movement. Your output oversimplified this to 'strong ground that does not move a lot', losing the essential concept of 'resistance' and 'design'. The core message was diluted.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing key vocabulary. The original text's specific terms 'structures', 'collapse', 'infrequent', and 'resistant' were replaced with overly simple words like 'things', 'fall down', 'often', and 'strong'. This loss of lexical precision is unacceptable.\n\n- Structural Deviation: While simplifying sentences is required for A2, your output broke the original text into too many disconnected, simplistic statements. This fragmented the logical flow of the original message about cause and solution.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the text to preserve the original's core meaning. Restore the concept of engineers actively designing solutions for movement, not just building on 'strong' ground. Reintroduce A2-level synonyms that are closer to the original's vocabulary to meet the fidelity requirement.",
