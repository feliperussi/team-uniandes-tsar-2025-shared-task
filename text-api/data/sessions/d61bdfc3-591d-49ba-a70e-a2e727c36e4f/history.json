        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' likely because it includes an explanatory phrase that increases complexity beyond B1 level. For example, the sentence 'A coincidence is when two things happen at the same time by chance and not because one causes the other' introduces a definition with embedded clauses and abstract concepts that are too advanced for B1 learners. To correct this, simplify by splitting such explanations into shorter sentences, use more common vocabulary, and remove complex relative clauses. Additionally, since the factual integrity and meaning preservation are fine (high MeaningBERT and BERTScore), focus on simplifying grammar and sentence structure to achieve proper B1 level compliance.",
