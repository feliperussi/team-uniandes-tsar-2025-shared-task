The original text establishes a direct causal link: 'improvements... fuelling rapid population growth'. Your version, 'technology and health got better. So, not many children died young.

The meaning is diluted.\n*   **Structural Fragmentation:** The original text concisely states a trend: 'the global average number of babies per woman has declined from six babies per woman to as low as two'. You fragmented this into three separate, choppy sentences: 'the number of babies... went down. Before, a woman had about six babies. Now, a woman has about two babies.' This destroys the flow and impact of the original statement.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n*   Rewrite the text to restore the cause-and-effect relationships.\n*   Do not break single concepts into multiple, disconnected sentences.

Your output oversimplifies this to the point of losing key concepts. The original specifies the 'global average number of babies', a statistical concept. Your version, 'the number of babies for each woman in the world', is less precise and loses the nuance of an average. This simplification is the primary cause of the low meaning preservation score.\n*   **Structural Flaw:** The sentence 'Because of this, fewer children died young, so the number of people grew very fast' uses two consecutive logical connectors ('Because of this', 'so'). This creates a complex causal chain that is inappropriate for the A2 level. A2 sentences must be simple and direct.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n1.  You must restore the lost meaning.
