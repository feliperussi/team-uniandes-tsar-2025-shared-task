This indicates a failure to fully preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n*   Primary Deviation: The original text expresses a strong feeling of unfairness and frustration, particularly in the final sentences. Your version, while factually correct, presents the information in a more neutral, descriptive tone. The phrase 'But now I see a problem' does not capture the same emotional weight as 'I've since noticed, though, that my workload hasn't decreased in the slightest!'. This tonal shift is the primary reason for the low meaning preservation score.\n\n*   Structural and Vocabulary Analysis: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to A2 standards in sentence structure and vocabulary. All sentences are short and simple, and the vocabulary is correctly limited to the A1/A2 levels. This aspect is executed correctly.\n\n*   Suggestion: Revise the final paragraph to better reflect the original's sense of injustice. The core message is not just that there is a problem, but that the situation is unfair. Rephrase to convey this using simple A2 terms. For example: 'This is not fair. I do five days of work in three days, but I get much less money.'",

This is a B1 structure and is too complex for the A2 level. The text must be composed of simple and compound sentences using only basic A2 connectors.\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence to remove the B1 structure.
