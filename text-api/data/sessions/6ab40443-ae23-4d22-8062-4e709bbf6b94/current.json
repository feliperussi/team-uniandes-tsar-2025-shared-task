    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an event that happens every year. The Capitol uses it to remind the districts that they are punished for fighting against them in the past. Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district. They are chosen by lottery to compete in a battle where only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\". Tributes are the people selected to fight in the games. The whole country must watch the event on TV.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text demonstrates a strong ability to write simple, connected text on a familiar topic. The sentence structure is effective, using connectors like 'that' and 'where' to link ideas clearly (e.g., 'an event that happens every year', 'a battle where only one person can survive'). You successfully simplified more advanced vocabulary from the original text, such as changing 'annual' to 'happens every year' and 'rebelling' to 'fighting against them', which is a key B1 skill. The definition provided for the keyword 'tributes' is clear and accurate. The overall text is coherent, factually correct, and meets all the requirements for the B1 level.",
