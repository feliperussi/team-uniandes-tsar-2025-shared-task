        "feedback_text": "The text demonstrates several B1 competencies, particularly in structure and flow. The use of connectors like 'that' and 'where' to create longer, connected sentences is a positive sign. For example, 'The Capitol uses it to remind the districts that they are being punished...' is a well-formed complex sentence. Factual accuracy is excellent. However, the assessment fails on vocabulary grounds. The protocol requires that any vocabulary above B1 must be defined as a keyword. The text uses the B2-level word 'being' in the passive construction 'are being punished' without defining it. This is a direct violation of the vocabulary balance rule, which states that unexplained advanced vocabulary is a failure. To achieve a PASS, all vocabulary must be within the B1 core, or any B2+ words must be explicitly defined in the keywords list."

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text demonstrates a strong ability to write simple, connected text on a familiar topic. The sentence structure is effective, using connectors like 'that' and 'where' to link ideas clearly (e.g., 'an event that happens every year', 'a battle where only one person can survive'). You successfully simplified more advanced vocabulary from the original text, such as changing 'annual' to 'happens every year' and 'rebelling' to 'fighting against them', which is a key B1 skill. The definition provided for the keyword 'tributes' is clear and accurate. The overall text is coherent, factually correct, and meets all the requirements for the B1 level."
