The text passes all metric checks but fails the qualitative audit due to the use of unsimplified B1-level vocabulary.\n\n- The word 'property' is classified as B1. It appears twice in your text.\n- The word 'private' is classified as B1. It appears once in your text.\n- The phrases 'public property' and 'private property' are too complex for the A2 level and must be broken down into simpler concepts.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all B1 vocabulary. Rephrase 'writing on public property' to 'writing on public buildings and walls'. Rephrase 'writing on private property' to 'writing on buildings that belong to a person'.",
