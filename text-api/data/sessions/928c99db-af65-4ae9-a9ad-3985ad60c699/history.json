These are not A2-compliant words and should have been replaced or defined.\n- Keyword Violation: The keyword 'feedback' was provided for definition. You did not define it; you eliminated it. This is a direct violation of the task.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce the word 'feedback'. Define it in simple A2 terms at the beginning. For example: 'Feedback is information about a person's work.' Then, rewrite the text using this key term. Replace 'lose their value' with an A2 phrase like 'are not important anymore'. Replace 'ignore' with 'do not listen to'.",

This shifts the focus from the value of the feedback to the listener's anticipation, which is a significant change in meaning.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8855 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This is because key concepts from the original text, such as 'devalued', 'constructive criticism', and feedback given 'for its own sake', were completely removed instead of being simplified. This results in a loss of factual detail.\n- An introductory sentence defining 'feedback' was added. The original text does not contain this definition. Do not add information that is not in the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. You must restore the original meaning that the good feedback itself loses its importance. Do not invent new concepts like 'waiting for the bad feedback'. Simplify the original ideas directly. For example, 'devalued' can be simplified to 'does not feel special' or 'loses its power'.",
