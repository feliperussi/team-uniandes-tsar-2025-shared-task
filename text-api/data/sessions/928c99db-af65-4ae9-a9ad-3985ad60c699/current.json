    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5337 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text explains that positive feedback becomes 'devalued and ignored'. Your version, 'people will stop listening to the good words', is a different and less accurate concept. The core message about the loss of value has been erased.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8846 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of omitting the key concept of 'constructive criticism' from the original text. Your simplification removed a critical component of the source material.\n\n- Structural Error: You added a definition of 'feedback' at the beginning. This was not part of the original text and constitutes a factual addition, which is not permitted.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the original meaning. The concept that good feedback loses its 'value' or 'importance' is non-negotiable. You must also find a simple A2 way to express the idea of not adding 'constructive criticism' or 'advice for improvement'.",
