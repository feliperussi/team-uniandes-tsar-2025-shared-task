    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7156 is below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to fully preserve the core message. The original text emphasizes the 'influence' of genetics on brain and language development, and 'how much influence genes have on language'. The writer's output uses 'help' instead of 'influence' ('How do genes help our brain grow?', 'How do genes help our language grow?', 'We do not know how much genes help language'). While 'help' is simpler, it does not fully capture the nuanced meaning of 'influence' as a shaping or determining factor, leading to a slight deviation in the core message. Additionally, the introductory sentence 'Genes are very small parts inside our body' is an addition not present in the original text, which can also contribute to a lower MeaningBERT score by introducing new information rather than solely simplifying the original content.",
