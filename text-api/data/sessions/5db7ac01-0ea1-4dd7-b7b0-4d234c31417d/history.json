The text loses crucial nuances and specific terminology from the original, which diminishes the core message. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8918 is below the required 0.90, indicating a loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5696 is too low. The original text discusses 'influence of genetics on brain and language development' and 'gene mutation'. Your version simplifies these to 'how genes help our brain' and 'gene change', which loses the specific biological and developmental context. The concept of 'mutation' is a key scientific term that is diluted by 'change'. The original's mention of 'DNA' is also simplified to 'genes', losing specificity.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8918 is below the required 0.90. This is due to the replacement of specific terms with more general ones, leading to a loss of lexical detail. For example, 'genetics' and 'development' are lost, 'mutated' and 'mutation' are replaced by 'change', 'connection with' is omitted, 'undergo this mutation' becomes 'did not change', and 'DNA' is replaced by 'genes'.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the original's specific scientific concepts, even at an A2 level. For instance, find an A2-appropriate way to convey 'mutation' or 'influence on development' without losing the core meaning.\n- Ensure that key terms, even if simplified, retain their specific meaning. 'Change' is too general for 'mutation'.\n- Review the text to ensure that all core ideas, such as the specific areas of influence (brain and language development) and the precise location of answers (DNA), are clearly and accurately represented.",

The extreme simplification fragmented the ideas, making the causal links less clear than in the original. The BERTScore of 0.8904 is also below the required 0.90, showing a substantial loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations: MeaningBERT Failure: The original text discusses the 'influence of genetics on brain and language development' and 'genes that mutated and gave us language ability'. Your version, by breaking down these concepts into overly simplistic and fragmented sentences like 'how small parts in our body change our brain' and 'how these parts change our language', dilutes the direct and nuanced connection between genes, brain, and language. The concept of 'influence' is lost. BERTScore Failure: Key terms from the original were replaced with less precise or overly simplified phrases, leading to lexical drift. 'genetics' was replaced with 'small parts in our body'. 'language development' was replaced with 'change our language'. 'researchers have found' was replaced with 'scientists learned about'. 'undergo this mutation' was replaced with 'did not get this mutation'. 'how much influence genes have on language' was replaced with 'how much these parts change language'. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain a clearer, more direct connection between genes, brain, and language development. Use slightly more precise A2 vocabulary where possible to preserve lexical fidelity without increasing complexity. Ensure the concept of 'influence' or 'connection' is explicitly maintained. Avoid excessive fragmentation of related ideas into too many separate sentences.",

While the CEFR classifier rated the overall text as A2, the specific vocabulary audit reveals critical non-compliance. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The word 'gene' is explicitly listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate. Its repeated use throughout the text, even after an initial A2-level definition ('small parts in our body'), constitutes a failure to adhere to the A2 vocabulary standard. The term itself must be replaced with A2 equivalents or consistently referred to by its simpler definition.\n- The word 'mutation' is not on a standard A1 or A2 vocabulary list and is typically considered B1 or B2. While the concept was simplified by defining it as 'change', the word 'mutation' itself should be avoided or replaced with the simpler term 'change' consistently.\n- The acronym 'DNA' is a technical term not typically found in A2 vocabulary lists and is likely B1 or B2. Its inclusion, even in the final sentence, deviates from the strict A2 vocabulary requirement.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Replace all instances of 'gene' with its A2 definition, such as 'small part in our body' or 'these parts'.\n- Replace all instances of 'mutation' with the A2 word 'change'.\n- Rephrase the sentence containing 'DNA' to use A2 vocabulary, for example, 'The answers are in these small parts inside us'.",

This indicates a critical loss of the core scientific meaning from the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8917 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key lexical items. The primary issue is the replacement of the specific scientific terms 'genetics', 'genes', and 'DNA' with the overly vague phrase 'small parts in our body'. While 'small parts' might refer to genes, it completely strips the text of its scientific context and precision, failing to convey the original message about genetic influence. The original text explicitly discusses 'genes that mutated' and 'gene mutation', which are core concepts that have been diluted to 'small parts' and 'change'. The keyword 'genes' was provided for definition, not for replacement with a generic term. Suggestion: Use the term 'genes' and provide a simple A2-level definition for it, rather than replacing it with a general phrase. Rephrase sentences to maintain the scientific specificity of 'genes' and 'mutation' while simplifying the sentence structure.",
