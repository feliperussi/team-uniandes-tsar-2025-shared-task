    "text_translated": "Are things getting worse every day, and is progress an impossible goal? In his book *Enlightenment Now*, Steven Pinker looks at the history of human progress and finds good news. He says that we are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. The **Enlightenment** was an important period in history. During this time, ideas about reason and science became very important. However, Pinker argues that the real problem is that these values are now under attack. He says that some leaders and commentators use people's negative feelings, like distrust. They also use the belief that you cannot change things. When this happens, we are in danger. We could cause serious damage to important systems like democracy and world co-operation.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This failure overrides the successful preservation of facts and meaning. The B2 classification is likely due to the use of complex sentence structures and vocabulary. For example, the final sentence, 'We could cause serious damage to important systems like democracy and world co-operation,' is quite dense for a B1 reader. Suggestion: Break this sentence into two simpler ideas, such as 'This could seriously damage important systems. For example, it could harm democracy and how countries work together.' On a positive note, the simplification of difficult concepts like 'fatalism' into 'the belief that you cannot change things' was excellent, and the definition for 'Enlightenment' was well-integrated.",
