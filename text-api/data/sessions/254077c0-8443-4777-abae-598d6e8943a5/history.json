Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two or three shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"He says some leaders use people's negative feelings, like distrust. When this happens, we risk causing serious damage to important systems like democracy and world co-operation.\" Despite this failure, the submission shows strong performance in other areas.
