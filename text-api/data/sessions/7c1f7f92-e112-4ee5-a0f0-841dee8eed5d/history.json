        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Vocabulary Violation. The text fails due to the inclusion of words above the A2 CEFR level. Adherence to the specified vocabulary level is not optional.\n\n- **Violation 1 (B1 Word):** The word 'punish' is B1 level. Its use in the sentence \"The government uses the games to punish the people...\" is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n- **Violation 2 (B1 Word):** The word 'battle' is B1 level. Its use in the sentence \"The tributes must fight in a battle\" is a direct violation of the A2 standard. The phrase is also redundant.\n- **Secondary Concern (Meaning Preservation):** The MeaningBERT score of 0.7383 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a minor but detectable loss of the original meaning. The original text emphasizes that the games are a 'reminder' of punishment, a nuance lost in your direct statement that the games 'punish' people.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n1.  Remove the word 'punish'. Rephrase to explain the concept in A2 terms. Example: \"...to show the people they did something wrong in the past.\"\n2.  Remove the word 'battle'. The A2 word 'fight' is already present and sufficient. The sentence should be: \"The tributes must fight.\""

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n*   **Primary Deviation - Lost Nuance:** The original text explicitly states the games are a form of \"punishment for rebelling.\" Your output dilutes this critical concept into the vague phrases \"did something wrong\" and \"did not follow the rules.\" This over-simplification removes the specific, harsh meaning of punishment and rebellion, which is central to the source material.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the core concept of punishment. Rephrase the second and third sentences to be more direct. Example: \"The government uses the games to punish the people. They punish them because they rebelled in the past.\""
