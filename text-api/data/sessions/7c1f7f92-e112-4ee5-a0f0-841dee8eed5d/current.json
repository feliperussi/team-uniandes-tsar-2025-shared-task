    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to punish the people. They punish them because they fought against the government in the past. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area. The children are 12 to 18 years old. These chosen children are called 'tributes'. Tributes are the people who must fight in the games. Only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on television.",
