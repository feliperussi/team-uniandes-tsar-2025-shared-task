    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6185 is significantly below the 0.75 minimum. The simplification has resulted in a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\nMeaning Preservation Failure: The text fails to convey the strong cause-and-effect relationship present in the original. The original states a 'lack of understanding' directly results in 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication'. Your version weakens this connection, causing the low MeaningBERT score.\n\nFidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8968 is below the 0.90 threshold. Key phrases like 'cultural norms and practices' and 'business acquaintances' were oversimplified, losing important lexical detail.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The B1-level adjective 'cultural' is used in the phrase 'cultural rules'. This is not A2 vocabulary. The A2 noun 'culture' must be used instead.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the direct link between not understanding and the specific problems that arise. Remove the word 'cultural' and replace it with an A2-compliant phrase, such as 'the rules of a culture'.",
