        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, as evidenced by the low MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance and scope. The BERTScore of 0.8758 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'growing consumer backlash.' Your version simplifies this to 'They did bad things' and 'People are very angry about plastic rubbish,' which narrows the scope of the 'unethical acts' to primarily plastic and reduces the specific concept of 'consumer backlash' to general anger. The original's mention of 'grocers' is also entirely omitted. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items and phrases from the original were lost or overly simplified. Examples include 'major supermarket chains' becoming 'Big shops are called supermarkets,' 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' becoming 'People are angry with many supermarkets. They did bad things,' 'tonnes of food' becoming 'a lot of food,' 'excessive plastic waste' becoming 'too much plastic packaging,' 'had its impact on our environment' becoming 'made problems for our world,' 'sit up and take notice' becoming 'starting to understand,' and 'signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' becoming 'signed an agreement. They will change packaging. They will use less plastic.' These simplifications reduce the lexical richness and precision required for a high fidelity score. Suggestion: Reintroduce the broader scope of 'unethical acts' beyond just plastic. Use more precise A2 vocabulary to convey 'consumer backlash' and 'pact.' Ensure key nouns and adjectives like 'major,' 'tonnes,' 'excessive,' 'environment,' and 'pact' are either retained or replaced with very close A2 equivalents that preserve the original meaning and detail.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5933 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8796 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. The simplification has gone too far, diluting the original message. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation 1: Meaning Preservation Failure. The original text describes 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'growing consumer backlash' leading to a 'pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage'. Your version simplifies this to 'People are angry with them. They did many bad things for ten years.' and 'Many people are very angry. They do not like the plastic rubbish... So, some big UK supermarkets made a special promise. They will change 'packaging'. They will use less plastic.' This loses the specific context of 'unethical acts' (underpaying suppliers, excessive waste) and the formal nature of a 'pact' to 'transform' and 'cut wastage'. The nuance of the supermarkets 'coming under fire' and 'starting to sit up and take notice' is also lost. Suggestion: Reintroduce the specific nature of the 'unethical acts' and the formal response. Deviation 2: Lexical Fidelity Failure. Key terms from the original text such as 'unethical acts', 'underpaid their suppliers', 'excessive plastic waste', 'impact on our environment', 'consumer backlash', 'pact', 'transform packaging', and 'cut plastic wastage' have been replaced with overly simple and less specific phrases. For example, 'unethical acts' became 'bad things', 'impact on our environment' became 'made problems for our world', and 'pact' became 'special promise'. This reduces the precision and detail of the message. Suggestion: Use slightly more descriptive A2 vocabulary to retain key concepts without increasing complexity. Deviation 3: Vocabulary Deviation. The word 'used' in the sentence 'They used too much plastic.' is classified as B1 in the provided vocabulary list. A2 texts should strictly adhere to A2 or A1 vocabulary. Suggestion: Rephrase to avoid B1 vocabulary, for example, 'They put too much plastic in their products.'",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6537 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8936 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key vocabulary and phrasing. Additionally, the CEFR classifier rated this text as B1, not A2, indicating it is too complex for the target level. This is a critical failure across multiple priority checks. \n\n*   Meaning Loss: The original's emphasis on 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' is diluted. Your version uses 'bad things' and 'showed their strong anger', which are less precise and lose the specific, formal nature of the original's accusations and public response. The concept of 'transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' is simplified to 'make big changes to packaging' and 'use less plastic that is thrown away', losing the active, transformative intent of the original. \n*   Lexical Fidelity Loss: Key terms from the original were not retained. For example, 'come under fire with accusations' was replaced by 'strongly criticised', 'unethical acts' by 'bad things', 'tonnes of food' by 'huge amounts of food', 'excessive plastic waste' by 'too much plastic', 'impact on our environment' by 'hurt our world', 'sit up and take notice' by 'listening and paying attention', 'consumer backlash' by 'people... very angry... showed their strong anger', and 'pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' by 'special agreement... make big changes... use less plastic that is thrown away'. These replacements, while simpler, collectively reduce the lexical richness and precision of the original, leading to the low BERTScore. \n*   CEFR Level Mismatch: The classifier identified the text as B1. This is a direct failure of the A2 target. The word 'strongly' is a B1 vocabulary item. The sentence structure, while broken down, still retains a B1 complexity in its overall flow and vocabulary choices. \n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the core message to ensure all nuances of 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', and 'transformative pact' are preserved using strictly A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. Replace B1 vocabulary like 'strongly' with A2 equivalents such as 'very much' or 'a lot'. Ensure key nouns and verbs from the original are retained where possible, or replaced with very close A2 synonyms to improve BERTScore and meaning preservation. Simplify sentence structures further to ensure strict A2 compliance.",

The core message of the original text, which details specific 'unethical acts' and a 'growing consumer backlash' leading to a 'pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage', has been diluted. For example, 'unethical acts' is reduced to 'bad things', and 'growing consumer backlash' is simplified to 'Many people were angry about the plastic. They showed their anger', losing the specific context of a response to the shops' actions. The BERTScore of 0.8865 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. For instance, 'supermarket chains' was replaced with 'big shops', 'past decade' with 'ten years', 'tonnes of food' with 'a lot of food', and 'signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' was simplified to 'made an agreement. They will change packaging a lot. They will use less plastic'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the lexical detail and specific phrasing from the original must be preserved more closely to maintain fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific nature of the 'unethical acts' and the 'consumer backlash' as a direct consequence. Use more direct translations of key terms where possible, such as 'supermarkets' instead of 'big shops' when referring to the specific entities. Ensure the agreement's purpose is clearly linked to the original's 'transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' with more precise A2 vocabulary.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Preservation Failure. The text failed to meet the required metrics for preserving the original meaning and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6682 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the core message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8908 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation in key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, this was achieved at the expense of fidelity to the source material. \n\nSpecific Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score: The original text's emphasis on 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' as drivers for change is diluted by overly simplistic phrasing like 'did bad things' and 'people were very angry... They showed their anger', which reduces the semantic similarity to the original's more formal and specific language regarding corporate responsibility and public pressure.\n- BERTScore: The extensive rephrasing, while simplifying for A2, resulted in a significant loss of lexical overlap with the original. For example, 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' was replaced with 'people criticised supermarkets and grocers. They did bad things.' 'Underpaid their suppliers' became 'paid their suppliers too little money.' 'Impact on our environment' became 'hurt our world.' 'Sit up and take notice' became 'shops are listening.' 'Consumer backlash' became 'people were very angry... They showed their anger to the shops.' These are all lexically distinct replacements, leading to the low BERTScore.\n- Added Content: The initial definition 'Packaging is the material around products. For example, plastic or paper.' is an addition not present in the original narrative. While potentially helpful for an A2 audience, it shifts the focus and contributes to the lower MeaningBERT score by introducing content not directly aligned with the original's core message about supermarket practices.\n\nSuggestion: To improve, maintain a closer lexical and semantic link to the original text while still simplifying. Focus on rephrasing specific complex words rather than entirely restructuring sentences with completely different vocabulary. For example, instead of 'did bad things', consider 'did wrong things' or 'made mistakes'. For 'consumer backlash', try 'people were angry and complained'. Ensure that the core concepts and specific actions described in the original are retained with minimal semantic drift.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6381 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of core message nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8991 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text conveys a sense of 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'growing consumer backlash'. Your version simplifies this to 'did wrong things' and 'people were very angry. They complained', which dilutes the specific and systemic nature of the issues and the organized public pressure. The core message of 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' is not fully preserved. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key terms from the original were replaced with less specific or less impactful phrasing. For example, 'supermarket chains' became 'big shops', 'unethical acts' became 'wrong things', 'tonnes of food' became 'much food', 'excessive plastic waste' became 'too much plastic', 'impact on our environment' became 'bad for our world', 'consumer backlash' was broken into 'people were very angry about plastic waste. They complained to the shops', and 'pact' became 'promise'. These lexical substitutions, while simple, collectively reduced the fidelity to the original text's specific language. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' concepts using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of 'did wrong things', consider 'did bad things that were not fair'. Instead of 'people were very angry. They complained', consider 'many people were angry and told the shops'.
