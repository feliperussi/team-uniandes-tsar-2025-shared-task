    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required metrics for meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6381 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of core message nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8991 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text conveys a sense of 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'growing consumer backlash'. Your version simplifies this to 'did wrong things' and 'people were very angry. They complained', which dilutes the specific and systemic nature of the issues and the organized public pressure. The core message of 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' is not fully preserved. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key terms from the original were replaced with less specific or less impactful phrasing. For example, 'supermarket chains' became 'big shops', 'unethical acts' became 'wrong things', 'tonnes of food' became 'much food', 'excessive plastic waste' became 'too much plastic', 'impact on our environment' became 'bad for our world', 'consumer backlash' was broken into 'people were very angry about plastic waste. They complained to the shops', and 'pact' became 'promise'. These lexical substitutions, while simple, collectively reduced the fidelity to the original text's specific language. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' concepts using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of 'did wrong things', consider 'did bad things that were not fair'. Instead of 'people were very angry. They complained', consider 'many people were angry and told the shops'. Review the original text for key nouns and verbs and attempt to retain them or use very close A2 synonyms to improve lexical fidelity without increasing complexity.",
