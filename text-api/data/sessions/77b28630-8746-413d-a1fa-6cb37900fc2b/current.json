    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the target B1 level. While the definitions for 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' are helpful and accurately address the Keywords for Definition, the way they are integrated and their very basic sentence structures ('A coincidence is when two events happen by chance at the same time. A prophecy is a prediction of future events.') have significantly lowered the overall complexity of the text. The original text was already quite accessible, and the added definitions, while accurate, push the overall text into an A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, the simplification should aim for clarity without oversimplifying the sentence structures or vocabulary to an A2 level. Consider rephrasing the definitions to be slightly more integrated or using slightly more complex B1-level sentence structures if the original text is already simple, or focus on other simplification strategies if the base text is already at a high A2/low B1 level.",
