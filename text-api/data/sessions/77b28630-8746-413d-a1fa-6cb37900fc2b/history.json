For example, the original's more complex noun phrase 'Dreams of a phone call from an old friend or the death of someone close... are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' was simplified to 'when we dream about an old friend calling or someone close dying, it is more probable that this is a coincidence than a prophecy'.

To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating definitions more subtly or using slightly more varied sentence structures that still remain accessible.

While the definitions for 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' are helpful for clarity, their very simple sentence structures, such as 'A prophecy is a prediction of future events,' combined with the simplification of the original text's second sentence from 'And, of course, we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen' to 'We also probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events, which then do not happen,' have collectively lowered the overall linguistic complexity to an A2 level.

The primary reason for this classification is the complex sentence structure introduced by embedding definitions using relative clauses within the main sentence. For example, the sentence 'Dreams of a phone call from an old friend or the death of someone close, for example, are more likely to be the result of a coincidence, which means two events happen by chance at the same time, rather than a prophecy, which is a prediction of future events' is too long and structurally complex for a B1 learner. While defining keywords is a good strategy, embedding these definitions as 'coincidence, which means...' and 'prophecy, which is...' increases the cognitive load and sentence complexity beyond B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider separating the definitions into distinct, simpler sentences (e.g., 'A coincidence is when two events happen by chance at the same time. A prophecy is a prediction of future events.') or rephrasing them more simply to avoid overly complex relative clauses within the main sentence.",

While the definitions for 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' are helpful and accurately address the Keywords for Definition, the way they are integrated and their very basic sentence structures ('A coincidence is when two events happen by chance at the same time. A prophecy is a prediction of future events.') have significantly lowered the overall complexity of the text. The original text was already quite accessible, and the added definitions, while accurate, push the overall text into an A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, the simplification should aim for clarity without oversimplifying the sentence structures or vocabulary to an A2 level. Consider rephrasing the definitions to be slightly more integrated or using slightly more complex B1-level sentence structures if the original text is already simple, or focus on other simplification strategies if the base text is already at a high A2/low B1 level.",
