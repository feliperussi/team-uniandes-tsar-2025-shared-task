    "text_translated": "It is helpful to understand that people have different expectations and ways of behaving, as this can help us avoid communication problems. However, it is also important to remember that cultural **stereotypes** can be harmful when building good business connections. **Stereotypes** are fixed and often unfair ideas about a group of people.\n\nAlthough national culture can influence how we act and think, many other things are also important. These include the area we come from, the groups we are part of, our age and gender, our company's culture, and our own experiences in life. Therefore, we should keep these possible differences in mind, but we should not use them to judge all people from a nation as if they are all the same.",
