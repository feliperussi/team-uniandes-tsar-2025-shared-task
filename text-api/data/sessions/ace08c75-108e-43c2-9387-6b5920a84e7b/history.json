The text successfully maintained factual integrity, preserved the core meaning with a MeaningBERT score of 0.8501, and demonstrated high fidelity to the original content with a BERTScore of 0.9502. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirmed appropriate A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. Complex sentence constructions from the original were effectively broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, and connectors were limited to A1/A2 level ('Then', 'So'). No B1 or higher vocabulary was detected. This is a well-executed A2 simplification.",
