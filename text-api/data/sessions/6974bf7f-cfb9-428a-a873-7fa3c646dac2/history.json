You state that engineers 'know how to build better bridges' and then, as a separate point, that 'They build them in places where the ground is strong'.\n- This separation breaks the logical link. The original's key idea is that building on strong ground *is* the method for making better bridges in these zones. Your version presents these as two disconnected facts, which fundamentally alters the meaning.\n- The phrase 'resistant to movement' is a key concept that has been lost. 'The ground does not move a lot' is a weak replacement that does not capture the engineering principle of resistance.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Connect the actions of the engineers directly to the solution. State that engineers build bridges in special ways for places with earthquakes. Example: 'Engineers learned how to build bridges for places with earthquakes. They build them on ground that is strong and does not move easily.' This restores the cause-and-effect relationship.",

This implies an active engineering solution to make the structure itself safer.\n- Your version states engineers 'build bridges on stronger ground'. This changes the meaning from a specific design process to a simple location choice, which is a factual oversimplification and a loss of the core concept.\n- The key idea of 'resistance' to movement is not adequately conveyed by 'stronger ground'.\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase to include the active role of the engineer.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The simplification has altered a key fact. The original text states that engineers build bridges 'on areas that are much more resistant to movement'. Your version, 'Engineers now design bridges in a special way. These bridges do not move easily,' changes the meaning from building on stable ground to designing a stable bridge. This is a significant factual distortion.\n- Linguistic Compliance: While the vocabulary and sentence structure successfully meet the A2 standard, this is irrelevant due to the failure to maintain the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to accurately reflect the original's focus on the location of the bridges.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.

Your version, 'Engineers build these bridges', removes the critical concept of acquired knowledge and intentional design, which is a key part of the original meaning.\n- The simplification of 'structures, including bridges' to 'buildings.

The text must convey that engineers use special knowledge.
