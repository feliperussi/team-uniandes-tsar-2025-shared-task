    "text_translated": "Faith47 is an artist from Cape Town, South Africa. She paints big, colourful pictures of people and animals and likes to explore different locations. Her work is found on pavements, in disused factories and on abandoned cars. She likes that most street art is temporary and will soon be removed by weather or cleaners from the city council. For her, this reflects how life is full of change with its cycle of endings and new beginnings.",

    "feedback": "The writer's output successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors, and the meaning and fidelity to the original text are exceptionally high, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9901. The text also correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was effective, making subtle but appropriate changes. The addition of 'an artist' in the first sentence clarifies Faith47's profession without altering the core meaning. The replacement of 'empty factories' with 'disused factories' is a good lexical choice, maintaining a B1 vocabulary level while offering a slightly more precise term. Removing 'the fact that' simplifies the sentence structure, which is a good practice for B1 learners. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. Overall, this is a strong simplification that maintains all critical aspects of the original while making minor improvements for the target audience.",
