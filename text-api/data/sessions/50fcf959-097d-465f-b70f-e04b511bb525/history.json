For example, you can see her art on pavements, in factories that are not used, and on old cars. She likes that most street art is temporary, which means it will soon disappear because the weather or cleaners from the city will remove it. For Faith47, this shows how life is always changing, with things ending and new things starting.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the target B1 level. While the text successfully preserves factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.8719, BERTScore: 0.9439), the simplification strategy consistently opted for vocabulary and sentence structures that are more characteristic of an A2 level. For example, 'explore different locations' was simplified to 'paint in many different places', and 'empty factories' became 'factories that are not used', which uses a very basic A2-level relative clause. Similarly, 'abandoned cars' was simplified to 'old cars', and 'city council' was reduced to 'city', losing some specific detail. The phrase 'reflects how life is full of change with its cycle of endings and new beginnings' was simplified to 'shows how life is always changing, with things ending and new things starting'. While clear, this simplification uses very basic vocabulary and breaks down a more abstract concept into overly simple terms for B1. To achieve a B1 classification, the text should aim for a slightly more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure, perhaps by retaining some B1-level synonyms or using B1 connectors more deliberately, while still ensuring clarity. For instance, 'disused factories' or 'unused factories' would be more appropriate for B1 than 'factories that are not used'.",

There are no factual errors, and the meaning and fidelity to the original text are exceptionally high, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9901. The text also correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was effective, making subtle but appropriate changes. The addition of 'an artist' in the first sentence clarifies Faith47's profession without altering the core meaning. The replacement of 'empty factories' with 'disused factories' is a good lexical choice, maintaining a B1 vocabulary level while offering a slightly more precise term. Removing 'the fact that' simplifies the sentence structure, which is a good practice for B1 learners. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. Overall, this is a strong simplification that maintains all critical aspects of the original while making minor improvements for the target audience.",
