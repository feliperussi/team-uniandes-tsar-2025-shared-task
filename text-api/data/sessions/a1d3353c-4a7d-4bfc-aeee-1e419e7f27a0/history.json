While the text successfully preserves factual integrity and meaning (as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores), its sentence structure is too advanced for the B1 level. The primary issue is the first sentence: 'Whether NASA can find the rest of the middle-sized asteroids depends on getting the money to build NEOCam, which is a 0.5-metre space telescope that would use infrared light to locate them.' This single sentence contains multiple clauses and complex grammatical relationships, which is characteristic of a B2 level. Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two or three simpler ones to meet the B1 requirement. For example: 'NASA wants to find the rest of the middle-sized asteroids. To do this, they need money to build NEOCam. NEOCam is a space telescope that would use infrared light to find them.'",

For example, the original phrase 'the planetary defence team would still need to work out how to defend the planet' was reduced to 'a special team will still need to find a way to defend the planet,' which uses much simpler vocabulary. To achieve a B1 level, consider reintroducing slightly more complex structures or vocabulary. For instance, you could combine sentences: 'Even if NASA finds the asteroids, a special team must still develop a plan to defend the planet from the most dangerous ones.' This uses a more complex sentence structure and B1 vocabulary like 'develop a plan'.",
