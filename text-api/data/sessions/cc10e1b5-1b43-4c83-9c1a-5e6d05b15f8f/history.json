This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8847, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- The primary failure is the extreme oversimplification that destroyed the original meaning. The original text explains that awareness of cultural differences is a tool to 'avoid cases of miscommunication'. Your version reduces this complex idea to the vague phrase 'help us understand other people better', which is not the same concept.\n\n- The original text's warning that stereotypes can be 'detrimental to building good business relationships' was weakened to 'very bad for business relationships'. This loses the specific meaning related to the process of building connections.\n\n- Key lexical items that carry significant meaning were completely removed, causing the low BERTScore. Words like 'miscommunication', 'expectations', 'pigeonhole', and 'corporate culture' are central to the original's message and were not replaced with adequate A2-level equivalents.\n\n- Suggestion: You must rewrite the text to preserve the original's specific points. Reintroduce the concept of 'understanding problems' or 'problems when people talk' to replace 'miscommunication'. The simplification of language must not lead to the destruction of the core information.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text presents a nuanced argument: awareness of cultural differences is useful but must be kept in the background to avoid the danger of stereotyping. Your version oversimplifies this, losing the central concept of holding knowledge 'at the back of our minds' versus actively using it to 'pigeonhole' people. The meaning has been diluted.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8894 is below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects the replacement of specific, important phrases. For example, 'detrimental to building good business relationships' and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' were lost.\n\n- Factual Omission: The list of influences on a person is incomplete. You omitted 'gender' and 'the communities we associate with' from the original text, further contributing to the meaning loss.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to more accurately reflect the original's warning. The final paragraph is too weak. Rephrase 'we must not use this to think all people from one country are the same' to more strongly capture the original's warning against using cultural knowledge to form stereotypes. Restore the omitted concepts of 'gender' and 'communities'.",

Your version, 'not think all people from one country are the same', captures the basic concept but loses the specific, forceful meaning of 'pigeonholing'.\n\n- Over-simplification: While the text successfully uses A2 vocabulary and sentence structures, the simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that does not accurately represent the meaning and intent of the source material.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text.
