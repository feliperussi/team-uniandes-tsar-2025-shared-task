    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6536 is critically below the 0.75 standard. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8756, which is below the required 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text issues a strong warning that stereotypes are 'detrimental to building good business relationships'. Your version weakens this to 'can be bad', which fails to communicate the severity and the negative impact on the process of building relationships.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The simplification process removed key concepts. The original's instruction not to 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' is a central idea. Your version, 'not think all people from one country are the same', captures the basic concept but loses the specific, forceful meaning of 'pigeonholing'.\n\n- Over-simplification: While the text successfully uses A2 vocabulary and sentence structures, the simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that does not accurately represent the meaning and intent of the source material.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. You must restore the original's strong warning about stereotypes. Use simple A2 terms to explain that stereotypes actively damage or prevent good business relationships, not just that they 'can be bad'. Rephrase the final sentence to better capture the idea of unfairly judging individuals based on their nationality.",
