    "text_translated": "Springsteen is different from many other artists who sell a lot of albums. He is almost 70 years old, but he still makes new music. His music is very popular. He plays in big stadiums. He is still very good at his job. I am not surprised by this. He tells very important stories about people. When you listen to his album 'Born in the USA', those stories are still important today. They were also important in the past.",

The simplification of 'late 60s' to 'almost 70 years old' is accurate and appropriate for the A2 level.\n\n- Metric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.7767) and BERTScore (0.9056) are above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, meeting the target standard precisely.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly controlled within the A1/A2 range. Complex original phrases like 'chart-topping, stadium-filling new music' are correctly deconstructed into simple, independent sentences: 'His music is very popular. He plays in big stadiums.' Sentence structure is consistently simple, utilizing only A2-appropriate connectors. No deviations were found.",
