The simplification of 'in his late 60s' to 'almost 70 years old' is an accurate and appropriate A2 adaptation.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7767 and BERTScore of 0.9056 are above the required thresholds, confirming preservation of meaning and key information.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates exemplary adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, using words like 'album', 'popular', and 'almost' correctly. Sentence structure is simple, relying on short sentences and basic A2 connectors like 'but' and 'when'. The original complex sentence was effectively broken down into multiple, easily digestible statements. No deviations were found."

The simplification of 'late 60s' to 'almost 70 years old' is accurate and appropriate for the A2 level.\n\n- Metric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.7767) and BERTScore (0.9056) are above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, meeting the target standard precisely.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly controlled within the A1/A2 range. Complex original phrases like 'chart-topping, stadium-filling new music' are correctly deconstructed into simple, independent sentences: 'His music is very popular. He plays in big stadiums.' Sentence structure is consistently simple, utilizing only A2-appropriate connectors. No deviations were found."
