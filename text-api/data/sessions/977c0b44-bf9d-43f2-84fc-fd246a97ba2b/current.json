Every year, one boy and one girl are chosen from each district. They are between the ages of 12 and 18. They are chosen by lottery to compete in a battle. Only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called **tributes**. Tributes are the people selected to fight in the games. The whole country must watch the event on TV.",
