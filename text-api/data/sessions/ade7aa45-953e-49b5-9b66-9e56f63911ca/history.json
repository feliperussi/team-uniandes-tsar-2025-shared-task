The new sentences you added introduce B1-level words ('battle', 'evil') which are not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to include all original facts without adding new ones.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8794 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text is over-simplified to the point of losing lexical fidelity. The original phrase 'directly base his story on the 17 stages of the hero's journey' was reduced to 'He used the hero's journey pattern.' This simplification removed critical words like 'base', 'story', and 'stages', causing the low BERTScore.\n- Secondary Deviation: The text uses B1-level vocabulary. The words 'used' and 'princess' are not on the standard A2 list.\n- Structural Flaw: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This damages the natural flow and contributes to the loss of original phrasing. For example: 'He finds a message inside the robot R2D2. The message is from Princess Leia. The message is for Obi-Wan Kenobi.'\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to include more key words from the original text without increasing complexity. Combine overly fragmented sentences to improve fidelity. Replace the B1 words 'used' and 'princess' with A2 alternatives.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text specifies the robot's name is 'R2D2'. Your output shortens this to 'R2', which is a factual error and an instant failure.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8756 is below the required 0.90. This is a secondary failure. The score is low because key factual terms from the original text, such as 'Princess Leia' and 'film directors', were replaced with less precise phrases like 'the lady Leia' and 'movie maker'. This damages the text's fidelity to the source.\n- Grammatical Error: The verb tense is incorrect and inconsistent. The text begins in the past tense ('George Lucas was...') but then incorrectly switches to the present tense ('He makes...'). The correct form is past tense: 'He made...'.\n- Structural Flaw: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text choppy and difficult to follow. It reads like a list of facts, not a coherent paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Correct all factual details to match the original text exactly, including names like 'R2D2'. Maintain a consistent past tense. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to create a more natural flow.",
