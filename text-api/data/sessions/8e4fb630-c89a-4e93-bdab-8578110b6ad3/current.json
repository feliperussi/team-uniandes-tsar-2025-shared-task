From Canada, Meagan has climbed the highest mountain on every continent, ridden a bike across Canada and run a long race in the Sahara Desert under scorching heat of about\u202f45\u202f\u00b0C. Her most impressive adventure was a skiing trip to the South\u202fPole. On the first day\u2011one, she fell into a deep crack in the glacier and had to be rescued. Many people would have given up, but Meagan kept going. She finally reached the South\u202fPole forty days later, pulling a sled with a tent and all her food through freezing conditions and ice storms.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the key metrics for meaning preservation are strong (MeaningBERT: 0.76, BERTScore: 0.93), confirming the core narrative is intact. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is effective, with good replacements like 'remarkable' to 'impressive' and 'carry on' to 'kept going'. The overall flow is clear and logical. The only point for improvement is a minor typo: the phrase 'On the first day-one' is slightly awkward and should be corrected to 'On the first day' for better readability. Correcting this would make the submission nearly perfect.",
