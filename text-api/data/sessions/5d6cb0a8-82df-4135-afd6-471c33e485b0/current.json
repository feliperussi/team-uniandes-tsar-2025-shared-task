The output meets all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The core message and all details from the original text have been preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics are well above the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.81 and BERTScore at 0.92 confirm that the meaning and key lexical items were successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The linguistic features align perfectly with this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. The original complex sentence was correctly broken down into multiple short, simple sentences using basic A2 connectors. The result is clear, direct, and perfectly readable for an A2 learner.",
