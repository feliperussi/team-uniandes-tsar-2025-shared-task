The linguistic content is perfectly aligned with this level.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. There are no instances of B1 or higher vocabulary, demonstrating perfect control.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's longer sentences have been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level. The breakdown of 'events and feelings' into separate sentences is a model example of this technique. The text is clear, direct, and fully compliant.",
