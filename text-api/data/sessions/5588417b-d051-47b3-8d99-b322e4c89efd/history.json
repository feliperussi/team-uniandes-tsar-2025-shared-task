The A2 standard was not met.\n\n- The sentence 'Suzanne says that her brain mixed the two types of programmes together in a worrying way...' is the primary violation. The use of a 'that-clause' for reported speech ('says that...') is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- The adjective 'worrying' is too advanced for the A2 level.\n- The final sentence is too long and structurally complex for an A2 reader, combining a 'that-clause' with a coordinating conjunction.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final part to eliminate the B1 grammar. Split it into two simple sentences. Replace 'worrying' with an A2-level word like 'strange'. For example: 'Suzanne says her brain mixed the two programmes. This was a strange idea. Her story...'."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Qualitative Audit Failure. The text passed all automated checks but fails on manual inspection due to vocabulary and structural violations of the A2 standard.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'competitions' is a B1-level noun. A strict A2 text must not use vocabulary above its designated level. The original text's concept of 'competing' was not simplified to an A2 equivalent.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'Other programmes were competitions between young people trying to win a million dollars' is too complex. The phrase 'trying to win a million dollars' functions as a post-modifying clause, a structure that exceeds the A2 standard of simple, conjoined sentences.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'competitions' with a simpler A2 phrase like 'games' or 'shows'. Split the complex sentence into two simple sentences. Example: 'Other programmes were shows. In these shows, young people tried to win a million dollars.'"

This confirms high fidelity to the source.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly registered as A2, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity.\n- Qualitative Analysis: The vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. The simplification of 'merge' to 'mixed' and 'disturbing' to 'strange' is correct. The complex sentence structure from the original, specifically the 'that-clause', was successfully deconstructed into simple sentences. The output is a model of A2 compliance."
