NASA, the American space agency, has made a map that shows 1,400 asteroids called Potentially Hazardous Asteroids or PHAs. These rocks come within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. None of these asteroids is expected to be a threat to Earth in the next 100 years. NASA has technology to watch these asteroids. They can guess if an asteroid might hit Earth. If that happens, NASA could use two defence ways to stop the impact and protect our planet.",
