        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'C1', which is significantly higher than the required B1 level. This likely results from the use of complex noun phrases and explanations that exceed B1 linguistic expectations. For example, phrases like 'the American space agency' and the sentence 'NASA already has technology to watch these asteroids and can predict if they might hit Earth' use constructions and vocabulary that are more advanced than B1, such as modal verbs combined with complex predicates and embedded clauses. To comply with B1, simplify sentence structures by using shorter sentences and more common vocabulary. Break complex sentences into smaller, clearer statements. Replace less frequent words with more familiar ones while retaining technical accuracy, and carefully control explanatory detail to fit the B1 level. Although the factual integrity and meaning preservation are strong, adjusting sentence complexity and vocabulary is crucial to meet B1 CEFR compliance.",
