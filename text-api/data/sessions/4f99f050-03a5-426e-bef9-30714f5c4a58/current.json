    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. NASA is now trying to find smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or more. There are about 25,000 of these asteroids. NASA has a list of 8,000 now. But 17,000 are still missing. In 2013, a small asteroid broke up over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a big danger. They are a danger if they come near Earth.",

Key concepts from the original text, such as 'logged' and 'exploded', have been expertly simplified to 'has a list' and 'broke up' without any loss of factual accuracy. The keyword 'asteroids' is immediately defined. No corrections are necessary.",
