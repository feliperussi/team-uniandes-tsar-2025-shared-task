The simplification of 'injured' to 'hurt' was correct. However, the presence of a single B1-level verb is an immediate failure."

Key concepts from the original text, such as 'logged' and 'exploded', have been expertly simplified to 'has a list' and 'broke up' without any loss of factual accuracy. The keyword 'asteroids' is immediately defined. No corrections are necessary."
