    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Check Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5795 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's depth. The BERTScore of 0.8935 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation in lexical content. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5795 is too low. The original text's emphasis on 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and 'cultural norms and practices' leading to 'breakdowns in communication' is not adequately preserved. The simplified version loses the specific detail and warning of the original. Deviation: The BERTScore of 0.8935 is too low. Key phrases and specific vocabulary from the original text were lost or overly simplified. For example, 'international borders' became 'across countries', 'global business community' became 'business people', 'nuances and expectations' were generalized, and 'stand you in good stead' was simplified to 'help you be ready'. This reduces the lexical fidelity. Deviation: The definition 'Etiquette means polite rules for how to act' was added. While defining keywords is part of A2 simplification, this addition was not present in the original text and contributed to the lower BERTScore by introducing new lexical content, thus reducing the direct fidelity to the source. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the specific concepts of 'nuances and expectations' and 'cultural norms and practices' using A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Restore closer lexical fidelity by finding A2 equivalents for terms like 'international borders' or 'global business community' that are more specific than the current simplifications. Suggestion: Integrate keyword definitions in a way that does not introduce new content but rather simplifies existing concepts from the original text.",
