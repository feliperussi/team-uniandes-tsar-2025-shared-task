The MeaningBERT score of 0.5458 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8773 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key lexical detail. This failure occurs at Priority 2 of the diagnostic protocol.\n\n*   Meaning Loss: The original text emphasizes the 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and the specific negative outcomes like 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies this to 'how people talk in business is different' and 'We can think bad things about people. We can not understand them. Talking can stop.' This simplification loses the depth and specific nature of the original message, particularly the concept of 'nuances' and the specific type of 'breakdowns in communication'.\n*   Lexical Fidelity Loss: Key terms from the original were replaced with overly simple or less precise phrases. For example, 'conducted across international borders' became 'happens in many countries now', 'global business community' became 'Most business people', 'cultural norms and practices' became 'rules', and the idiom 'stand you in good stead' was reduced to 'help you'. This reduces the fidelity to the original's specific phrasing and lexical richness.\n*   Sentence Fragmentation: While A2 requires simple sentences, the extreme fragmentation and repetition ('It is different in every country. We need to know the etiquette of other countries. If we do not know these rules, there can be problems.') further dilutes the flow and connection of ideas present in the original, contributing to the loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the core message of each original sentence. Ensure that the simplified version conveys the same specific information and implications, even if using simpler words. Focus on preserving the specific types of problems (judgements, misunderstandings, breakdowns) and the proactive benefit of understanding etiquette. Avoid excessive sentence fragmentation that breaks the logical flow of ideas. The definition of 'etiquette' at the beginning is extraneous to the core task of simplifying the provided text.",

Your simplification to 'ways people talk and act in business are different' and 'ways of other cultures' loses the depth of these concepts, which are central to the original's message about communication challenges.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.625 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original's meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8898 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating insufficient lexical preservation. Specific deviations are listed below: 1.

The phrase 'cultural norms and practices' was simplified to 'rules of other cultures' and 'ways of doing business', which is less precise. The specific benefit 'could help stand you in good stead' was weakened to 'can help you do well', losing the idiomatic meaning. The term 'breakdowns in communication' was simplified to 'Communication can stop', which is less formal and precise. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the specific concepts of 'nuances', 'expectations', 'norms', and 'practices' using appropriate A2 vocabulary. Ensure the specific benefit of 'standing in good stead' is conveyed more accurately. Review and reintroduce key lexical items where possible without exceeding A2 complexity.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6699 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message's depth. For example, the original's emphasis on 'nuances and expectations of business communication might differ greatly' is diluted to 'how people talk in business is very different. Small details are important. What people expect is also different.' The original's 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication' is simplified to 'think badly of them.

The BERTScore of 0.8919 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. For instance, 'international borders' was replaced with 'different countries', 'global business community' with 'business people in the world', 'cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances' with 'rules of other cultures... their ways of doing business... people we work with', and 'help stand you in good stead' with 'help you be ready'. These replacements, while simpler, do not retain sufficient lexical overlap with the original. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary and the depth of its message regarding 'nuances', 'greatly differ', and the specific negative outcomes like 'unfair judgements'.

While individual facts are present, the overall meaning, emphasis, and the nuanced relationship between ideas from the original text have been lost or diluted.

The original's more formal and cautionary tone regarding the 'breakdowns in communication' is also not fully conveyed.

Ensure the subtle complexities implied by 'nuances and expectations' are conveyed, even with simpler vocabulary, rather than just stating 'small differences'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5795 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's depth. The BERTScore of 0.8935 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation in lexical content. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5795 is too low. The original text's emphasis on 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and 'cultural norms and practices' leading to 'breakdowns in communication' is not adequately preserved. The simplified version loses the specific detail and warning of the original. Deviation: The BERTScore of 0.8935 is too low. Key phrases and specific vocabulary from the original text were lost or overly simplified. For example, 'international borders' became 'across countries', 'global business community' became 'business people', 'nuances and expectations' were generalized, and 'stand you in good stead' was simplified to 'help you be ready'. This reduces the lexical fidelity. Deviation: The definition 'Etiquette means polite rules for how to act' was added. While defining keywords is part of A2 simplification, this addition was not present in the original text and contributed to the lower BERTScore by introducing new lexical content, thus reducing the direct fidelity to the source. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the specific concepts of 'nuances and expectations' and 'cultural norms and practices' using A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Restore closer lexical fidelity by finding A2 equivalents for terms like 'international borders' or 'global business community' that are more specific than the current simplifications. Suggestion: Integrate keyword definitions in a way that does not introduce new content but rather simplifies existing concepts from the original text.",
