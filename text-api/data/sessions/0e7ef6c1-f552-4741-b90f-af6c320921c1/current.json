    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6824 is below the required 0.75. While factual information is largely present, the core message's cohesion and nuance have been significantly diluted through excessive fragmentation and oversimplification of key concepts. The original text presents a concise and integrated narrative, which your version breaks into numerous short, disconnected sentences, thereby losing the original's intended flow and emphasis. This fragmentation impacts the overall meaning and impact of the summary. Specific deviations include: The original's integrated description of Pi's predicament ('shipwrecked and finds himself trapped in a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a ferocious tiger') is broken into multiple, separate sentences ('His ship had a big accident. Pi was then stuck on a small boat in the big Pacific Ocean. He was with a very wild tiger.'), which diminishes the direct cause-and-effect and the intensity of the situation. The term 'extraordinary story' is weakened to 'very special and unusual story', losing some of the original's emphasis on the remarkable nature of the tale. The specific and concise term 'diplomat' is replaced by the descriptive but less precise phrase 'His father worked for his country in other countries', which, while factually correct, loses the specific lexical detail and professional context of the original. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain a more cohesive flow, connecting related ideas within single, simple A2-level sentences rather than fragmenting them excessively. Restore some of the original's descriptive power where possible without exceeding A2 vocabulary, for example, by using stronger A2 adjectives.",
