This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text. A secondary failure was detected in the BERTScore of 0.8923, which is below the 0.90 requirement, indicating a loss of key phrasing.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The primary failure is the loss of the original text's urgent and cautionary tone. The original uses strong language like 'murderbots' and 'unethical', which you have neutralized to 'new robots' and 'very wrong'. This changes the entire message from a warning to a simple description.\n- The specific proper noun 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots' was oversimplified to 'a group'. This removes essential context and factual detail, contributing directly to the low meaning and fidelity scores.\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with A2, the simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that does not accurately represent the source material's intent.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write to restore the core meaning. The text must convey a sense of warning and opposition. Do not remove specific names like the campaign; instead, explain it in simple terms if necessary. The goal is A2 readability, not the complete removal of important facts.",

This indicates a failure to retain sufficient key words and phrasing from the original text. The text is factually correct and meets the A2 classification, but it fails on this critical metric. Deviation: Key terms were over-simplified, causing a loss of lexical fidelity. The original text specified 'gun turrets' and 'sentry robots'. Your output replaced these with the generic phrases 'robot guns' and 'robot guards'. This change is the primary reason for the score dropping below the minimum requirement. Deviation: The phrase 'very little human input' was changed to 'A person does not help very much'. While the meaning is similar, the rephrasing contributes to the overall fidelity loss. Suggestion: Retain specific, important nouns from the original text like 'gun turrets' and 'sentry robots'. Do not replace them with generic descriptions.
