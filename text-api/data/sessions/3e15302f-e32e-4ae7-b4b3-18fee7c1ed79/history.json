Raising money is the act of collecting it; asking is only the request. The original meaning is not preserved.\n*   Lexical Loss: The specific action 'guide him' was reduced to 'helped him'.

This change, combined with the loss of 'protest', significantly weakens the message about the environmental issue.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original meaning using A2-compliant vocabulary. The action of 'protest' must be restored. A phrase like 'He told people it was wrong to destroy the rainforest' is stronger. The action of 'raise money' must be restored. Use 'He collected money'.

This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Lost: The low BERTScore is a direct result of oversimplification. Replacing 'media interest in his trip' with 'the news' and 'raise money' with 'collected money' lost too much of the original's specific phrasing, failing the fidelity check.\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses the B1 words 'rainforest' and 'protest', and the B2 word 'destruction'. These words are not on the A2 list and are too complex for the target reader. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n- Suggestion: Restore lexical fidelity. Rephrase sentences to be closer to the original's wording while maintaining A2 simplicity.\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'rainforest' with a simple description like 'the big forest with a lot of rain'. Replace 'protest' and 'destruction' with simpler verb-based explanations, such as 'He told people it is wrong to destroy the forest'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8835 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and factual detail.\n- Meaning Loss: The original text states Ed used his trip to 'protest about the destruction of the rainforest'. Your version, 'He told them it is wrong to hurt the forest', is too weak and loses the meaning of an active protest.\n- Fidelity Loss: Key factual words were removed, causing the low BERTScore. Words like 'rainforest', 'destruction', 'environmental', and 'charities' are essential to the meaning and were replaced with overly simple terms like 'forest' and 'help groups'.\n- Oversimplification: The attempt to simplify has resulted in a text that no longer accurately reflects the purpose and impact of the walk.\nSuggestion: Reintroduce the key vocabulary. You must find A2 ways to explain concepts like 'protest' and 'charity' without losing their meaning entirely. Example: 'He told many people that it is very bad to destroy the rainforest. He asked for money for special groups that help nature and children.'",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. The simplification process has removed too much lexical detail.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The original phrase 'He used the media interest in his trip' was replaced with 'Many people heard about his trip'. This loses the critical concept of Ed actively using the attention for a purpose.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'used' was not replaced. It appears in the sentence 'He used the radio...'. This is a direct violation of A2 vocabulary constraints.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'rainforest' was not replaced. It appears twice in the output. This word is above the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'destruction' was not replaced. This word is far too advanced for an A2 text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The verb 'protested' is a B1-level concept and was used without simplification.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning by connecting ideas. Instead of six separate sentences at the end, combine them to show cause and effect. Replace all B1 and B2 vocabulary. 'Used' must be replaced with an A2 alternative. 'Rainforest' must be simplified to 'big forest' or similar. 'Destruction' and 'protested' must be rephrased using simple A2 verbs, for example: 'He told people it was bad that the big forest was being hurt.'",

This loses the specific and more accurate vocabulary.\n- Example 2: The concept 'protest about the destruction of the rainforest' was simplified to 'it was bad that the big forest was hurt'.

This simplification loses the specific concept of media involvement.\n\nCorrective action required:\n- Revise the text to increase lexical fidelity. You must stay closer to the original vocabulary where it is A2-appropriate.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore key concepts. Instead of 'hardest ground', use 'the most difficult land'.
