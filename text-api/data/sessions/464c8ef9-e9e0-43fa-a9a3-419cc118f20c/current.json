    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6308 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8984 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, but this does not compensate for the fundamental failures in meaning and fidelity. The original text emphasizes the continuous, challenging nature of Meagan McGrath's adventures, stating 'Not content with one amazing trip, some of today's adventurers go from challenge to challenge.' Your version simplifies this to 'She likes hard trips. She always wants to do a new hard thing, not just one,' which dilutes the meaning of dedicated adventuring and the concept of 'challenge.' Lexical fidelity is also compromised. Key terms like 'adventurers,' 'challenge,' 'remarkable,' 'rescued,' 'sledge,' and 'freezing conditions' were either omitted or replaced with less precise A2 equivalents. For example, 'sledge' was replaced with 'a thing,' and 'rescued' with 'someone had to help her.' While simplification is necessary for A2, the chosen replacements led to a significant loss of specific detail and the overall impact of the narrative. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to better convey the idea of continuous, difficult adventures. For example, 'Meagan likes to do many hard trips, not just one. She always wants a new challenge.' Reintroduce specific vocabulary where possible by defining it simply, such as 'sledge' as 'a special thing she pulled on the ice' or 'rescued' as 'someone saved her life.' Ensure that the essence of the original's descriptive language is maintained through careful A2-level rephrasing.",
