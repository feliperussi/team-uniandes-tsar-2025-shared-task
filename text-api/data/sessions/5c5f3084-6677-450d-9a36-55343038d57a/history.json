All locations, animals, and the core message are preserved.\n- Metric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.90) are within required parameters, indicating successful meaning and lexical preservation. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Analysis: The text demonstrates superior adherence to A2 standards. Complex sentences are correctly deconstructed into simple, declarative statements. Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1-A2 lexicon. The simplification of 'pest' to 'problem' is a correct and necessary adjustment for this level.",

The simplification of 'pest' to 'problem' and 'press' to 'news' is correct and demonstrates adherence to the standard.\n\n- Structural Analysis: Sentence structure is exemplary for A2. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple declarative statements.\n\n- Grammatical Simplification: The use of repetition ('People see...') to replace the more complex present perfect tense ('There have been...') is an effective and appropriate A2 simplification strategy.\n\n- Overall Compliance: The text is clear, direct, and easily understandable for an A2 learner. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
