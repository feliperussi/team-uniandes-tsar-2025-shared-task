    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks. It maintains factual integrity, preserves meaning (MeaningBERT 0.85, BERTScore 0.91), and is correctly classified as A2.\n\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'pest' to 'problem' and 'press' to 'news' is correct and demonstrates adherence to the standard.\n\n- Structural Analysis: Sentence structure is exemplary for A2. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple declarative statements.\n\n- Grammatical Simplification: The use of repetition ('People see...') to replace the more complex present perfect tense ('There have been...') is an effective and appropriate A2 simplification strategy.\n\n- Overall Compliance: The text is clear, direct, and easily understandable for an A2 learner. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
