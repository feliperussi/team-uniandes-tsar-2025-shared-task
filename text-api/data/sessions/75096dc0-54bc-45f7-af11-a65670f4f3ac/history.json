While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity (Priority 1) and meaning/fidelity (Priority 2), the output is too simple in its sentence structure and vocabulary for a B1 target. The writer primarily used short, simple sentences, often splitting information that could be combined with B1-level connectors. For example, the original sentence 'These 'near-Earth objects', or NEOs, are the size of mountains and include anything within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit' was broken into four very basic sentences: 'These asteroids are called 'near-Earth objects' (NEOs). They are objects that are close to Earth. They are as big as mountains. They include anything within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' To achieve a B1 level, the text needs more varied sentence structures, including a greater use of conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'while', 'since', 'because', 'so that') and relative clauses, and a slightly more sophisticated vocabulary, while still remaining accessible. The current approach of excessive sentence splitting results in a choppy, A2-level reading experience. Suggestion: Recombine some of the shorter sentences using appropriate B1 conjunctions and relative pronouns to create more complex, yet still clear, sentence structures.",

While the writer successfully broke down some complex sentences and used appropriate B1 vocabulary (e.g., 'agency', 'significant'), some sentences remain too long or dense for a B1 reader. For example, the sentence 'They can be found up to 50 million kilometres from Earth's path around the sun' combines a large number with a multi-word spatial description, which can increase cognitive load beyond B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider further simplifying such sentences, perhaps by splitting them or rephrasing the spatial information more concisely. For instance, 'They can be found up to 50 million kilometres from Earth. This is how far Earth travels around the sun.' or 'They are found within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' (if 'orbit' is defined as a keyword). The frequent use of specific numbers (90%, 1km, 50 million, 50, 887) also contributes to the perceived complexity for a B1 reader.",

While the MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics indicate good preservation of meaning and fidelity, the sentence structures used are too complex for a B1 audience. For example, the sentence 'In 2010, NASA's team that protects Earth from space objects recognized and recorded 90% of the asteroids near Earth that were 1km wide' contains two relative clauses modifying different nouns, which increases its structural complexity. Similarly, the sentence 'These are called 'near-Earth objects' (NEOs), which are as big as mountains and are found within 50 million kilometres of Earth's orbit' uses a relative clause with a compound predicate ('which are as big as mountains and are found within...'), making it more challenging. The final sentence, 'However, NASA knows about 887 NEOs, and the agency says that none of these are a significant danger to the planet', is a compound-complex sentence that combines multiple clauses and connectors ('However', 'and', 'that'-clause), which is characteristic of B2 level writing. To achieve B1 compliance, consider breaking down longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones. For instance, split sentences with multiple clauses or compound predicates into two distinct sentences. Ensure that complex grammatical structures are simplified or rephrased to reduce cognitive load for the target audience.",
