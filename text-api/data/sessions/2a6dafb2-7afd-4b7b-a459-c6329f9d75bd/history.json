A riot is when angry people break things in the street.\n\nGary knew some of the people on the TV. He was on holiday, but he stopped his holiday early. He wanted to help the other police. He helped them find the names of the people.\n\nFor six months, he watched security camera videos. He found and named 190 people. Sometimes, he only saw their eyes. His help was very, very important.\n\nThe police had 200,000 hours of video. A computer program also looked at the videos. But the computer only found one person.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.894 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key terminology from the original text. Phrases like 'facial recognition software' were replaced with 'A computer program', and 'CCTV film' with 'security camera videos'. While simplification is necessary, this level of replacement damaged lexical fidelity.\n\nAdditional Violations:\n- Vocabulary Audit Failure: The text uses the B1-level word 'security'. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n- The definition of 'riot' is good, but it should have been provided as a keyword definition, not embedded in the main narrative text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to increase lexical overlap with the original without sacrificing A2 simplicity. For example, 'a computer program to find faces' is more descriptive than 'A computer program'. Remove the B1 word 'security'. 'Camera videos' is sufficient for A2.",

The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with this level.\n\n- Qualitative Excellence: The simplification of B1/B2 concepts is outstanding. 'Off-duty' became 'not working'. 'Identification' became 'find the names of the people'. 'Facial recognition software' became 'a computer program to find faces'. This demonstrates a masterful command of the A2 standard. The text uses short, declarative sentences and basic connectors, ensuring maximum readability.",
