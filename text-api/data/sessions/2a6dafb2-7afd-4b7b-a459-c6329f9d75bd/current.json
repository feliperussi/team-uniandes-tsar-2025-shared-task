He was on holiday, but he stopped his holiday early. He wanted to help the other police. He helped them find the names of the people.\n\nFor six months, he watched camera videos. He found and named 190 people. Sometimes, he only saw their eyes. His help was very, very important.\n\nThe police had 200,000 hours of video. They used a computer program to find faces.

    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers (190 people, 200,000 hours, one person), and the core narrative are perfectly preserved from the original text.\n\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.80 and BERTScore of 0.90 are well within the required thresholds, confirming that meaning and key terms were retained.\n\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with this level.\n\n- Qualitative Excellence: The simplification of B1/B2 concepts is outstanding. 'Off-duty' became 'not working'. 'Identification' became 'find the names of the people'. 'Facial recognition software' became 'a computer program to find faces'. This demonstrates a masterful command of the A2 standard. The text uses short, declarative sentences and basic connectors, ensuring maximum readability.",
