The original text specifies a timeframe of 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago', but the output removes this critical information, replacing it with the vague phrase 'from that period'. This loss of specific data is a critical error. This omission also contributed to a failure in Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.702 is below the required 0.75 threshold, confirming that the core message and its context were altered. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR Compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to complex sentence structures, such as the opening clause 'Although we find evidence...'. To correct this, the sentence should be split into two simpler sentences.

While the output successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, with excellent MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.9493) metrics, it failed the simplification task by using sentence structures that are too advanced for the B1 level. The first sentence, 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings that date from between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, although nobody knows the connection between these paintings and language,' is a long sentence containing multiple clauses. The use of 'although' to connect these ideas is a B2-level feature. Similarly, the second sentence begins with 'While', creating a subordinate clause that increases complexity. Suggestion: To achieve a B1 level, break these sentences down. For instance, the first sentence could be rewritten as: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings. These paintings are from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Nobody knows the connection between these paintings and language.' This approach simplifies the grammar while retaining all key information.",

Specifically, the first long sentence of the original text was broken down into three very short, simple sentences. This removed the syntactic complexity needed for a B1 classification. To correct this, try combining some of the simplified sentences using B1 connectors. For example: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, but no one knows the connection between this art and language.'",

The sentence 'Although the brain did not suddenly become larger, humans became more complex and more intelligent' uses a subordinate clause starting with 'Although', a structure typically associated with the B2 level. To meet the B1 requirement, this sentence should be simplified using a coordinating conjunction. For example: 'The brain did not suddenly become larger, but humans became more complex and more intelligent.' While the text successfully passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks with high scores, failing to meet the target CEFR level is a critical error in a simplification task.",

This is likely due to the syntactic complexity of the first sentence: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings that date from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, but no one knows the connection between this art and language.' This sentence is too long and combines multiple clauses, including a relative clause ('that date from...'), which is a characteristic of a B2 level. Suggestion: Split this into two or more simpler sentences to meet the B1 standard. For example: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings. These paintings are from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. However, no one knows the connection between this art and language.' On a positive note, the output is factually accurate and successfully preserves the original meaning, as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores.",
