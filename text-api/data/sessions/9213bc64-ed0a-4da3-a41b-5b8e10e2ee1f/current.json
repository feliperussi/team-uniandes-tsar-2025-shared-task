    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the syntactic complexity of the first sentence: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings that date from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, but no one knows the connection between this art and language.' This sentence is too long and combines multiple clauses, including a relative clause ('that date from...'), which is a characteristic of a B2 level. Suggestion: Split this into two or more simpler sentences to meet the B1 standard. For example: 'We find evidence of early human civilisation in cave paintings. These paintings are from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. However, no one knows the connection between this art and language.' On a positive note, the output is factually accurate and successfully preserves the original meaning, as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores.",
