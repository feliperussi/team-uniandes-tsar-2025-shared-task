    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Vocabulary Compliance: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. Words like 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' were correctly replaced with simple A2 concepts like 'happens by chance' and 'message about the future'.\n\n- Structural Simplification: The original complex sentence structure was correctly deconstructed into a series of short, simple sentences. This is the required standard for A2 readability.\n\n- Meaning Preservation: The core message of the original text has been fully retained. This is confirmed by the high MeaningBERT score of 0.89 and BERTScore of 0.92, which exceed the required thresholds.\n\n- CEFR Classification: The output correctly registers as A2, meeting the primary objective. No deviations were detected.",
