This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message. The original text states that dreams are 'more likely to be the result of coincidence', which is a statement of probability. Your version changes this to an absolute fact: 'This is not because you can see the future. It happens just by chance.' This simplification removes the nuance and alters the meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8959 is also below the required 0.90. This is due to replacing key phrases like 'someone close' with the less specific 'someone you know', losing fidelity. The original's concept of 'we probably choose to forget' is simplified to 'we forget', losing the element of intentionality. Suggestion: Restore the meaning of probability. Change 'This is not because...' to 'This usually means it is just by chance...'. Use the exact phrase 'someone close' to maintain fidelity with the source text.",
