While the simplification successfully lowered the complexity from the original, it overshot the B1 target, resulting in a text that is more appropriate for an A2 learner. For example, the phrase 'becomes very skilful with a bow and arrow' was simplified to 'is very good with a bow and arrow', and 'finds herself in a complicated relationship' became 'has a difficult relationship'. These changes, along with the consistent use of simple sentence structures and basic conjunctions like 'so' and 'and', contribute to the A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, the text should incorporate a slightly wider range of B1 vocabulary and sentence structures, such as more varied conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'however'), or slightly more complex verb phrases, without reaching B2 complexity. The definition of 'tributes' is a good B1 strategy, but the surrounding text needs to be elevated slightly.",

While the definition of 'tributes' (a C1 word) is an appropriate simplification strategy for a B1 audience, the overall linguistic complexity of the output text remains at an A2 level according to the classifier. The original text itself contains predominantly simple sentence structures and common vocabulary, which the simplification did not sufficiently elevate to a consistent B1 level. To achieve a B1 classification, consider introducing more varied sentence structures, such as more complex conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'however', 'therefore') or relative clauses, or incorporating additional B1-level vocabulary where appropriate, without oversimplifying existing B1 concepts. For example, while the definition of 'tributes' is good, the surrounding sentences could be targeted for slight structural or lexical enhancements to meet the B1 threshold.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.864) and BERTScore (0.9714) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'tributes' by integrating a clear explanation within the sentence. The additions, such as 'which helps her become very skilful' and 'even though it means facing great danger', enhance clarity and provide appropriate B1-level contextual information without altering the original meaning. The vocabulary strategy is strong, retaining B1-appropriate terms and defining more complex ones. The overall flow and structure are excellent, making the text highly accessible for a B1 learner.",
