She hunts in the woods around District 12 with her friend Gale, which helps her become very skilful with a bow and arrow. When her younger sister, Prim, is chosen as one of the **tributes**, which are young people chosen to fight in a deadly game, Katniss volunteers to go instead, even though it means facing great danger. The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, who Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.864) and BERTScore (0.9714) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'tributes' by integrating a clear explanation within the sentence. The additions, such as 'which helps her become very skilful' and 'even though it means facing great danger', enhance clarity and provide appropriate B1-level contextual information without altering the original meaning. The vocabulary strategy is strong, retaining B1-appropriate terms and defining more complex ones. The overall flow and structure are excellent, making the text highly accessible for a B1 learner.",
