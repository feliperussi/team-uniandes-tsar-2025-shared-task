    "feedback": "PASS: Exemplary Adherence to A2 Standard.\n\nThe submission meets all requirements of the A2 protocol without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts from the original text were preserved with 100% accuracy.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.82 and BERTScore of 0.93 are well above the minimum thresholds of 0.75 and 0.90, respectively. This confirms the core message and key lexical items were successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classified as A2, demonstrating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. Complex concepts like 'psychopath' and 'narrow staircase' were correctly simplified to 'very bad person' and 'small stairs'. Sentence structure is consistently short and simple, breaking down complex ideas into easily digestible units. The keyword 'basement' was defined immediately and clearly. No errors were found.",
