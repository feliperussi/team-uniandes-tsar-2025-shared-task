No information was lost or altered.\n- Metric Adherence: All metrics are well within the required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.82 and BERTScore at 0.92 confirm high fidelity. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 levels. Simplifications such as 'evil psychopath' to 'very bad person' and 'damp' to 'wet' are executed perfectly.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences. Complex ideas from the original are broken down into individual, easy-to-understand statements. The use of connectors is limited to basic A2 forms.\n- Keyword Definition: The keyword 'basement' is clearly and simply defined in the first sentence, which is exemplary practice.",

Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. Complex concepts like 'psychopath' and 'narrow staircase' were correctly simplified to 'very bad person' and 'small stairs'. Sentence structure is consistently short and simple, breaking down complex ideas into easily digestible units. The keyword 'basement' was defined immediately and clearly. No errors were found.",
