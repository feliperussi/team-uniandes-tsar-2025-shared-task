We should look for ways to offer employees more flexible working hours. We should also consider how we can allow them to work from a location they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff. They also need to give more positive feedback and show that they value the work people do. Spending more money on professional training could also help create a positive work environment. This is especially important for social and communication skills. This will help employees to do their best work.",
