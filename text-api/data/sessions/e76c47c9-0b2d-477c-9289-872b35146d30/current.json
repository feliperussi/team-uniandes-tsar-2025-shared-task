We should also let them work from a location they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff. They should also give positive comments about their work. They must show they value what their employees do. Spending more money on professional training could also help. This can create a positive work environment. This is very important for social and communication skills. This will help employees do their best work.",
