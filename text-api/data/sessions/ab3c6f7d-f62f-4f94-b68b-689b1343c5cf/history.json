While the general concepts are conveyed, the simplification has reduced the specificity and scientific nuance of the original text, leading to a loss of the precise meaning. For example, 'breeding programmes' was simplified to 'programmes for animals to have babies', and 'genetic diversity' was simplified to 'make the genes more varied'. These changes, while aiming for simplicity, dilute the precise scientific and conservationist emphasis present in the original text. The core message about the structured, scientific efforts of zoos to maintain genetic health is less prominent. To improve, consider using B1-level synonyms or phrasings that retain more of the specific terminology's meaning, even if simplified in structure. For instance, 'breeding programmes' could be simplified to 'programmes for breeding animals' to keep the noun 'breeding' which is more specific than 'having babies'.",

While the text is largely faithful to the original, the metric indicates a slight semantic drift or loss of nuance. This is likely due to a combination of factors: the cumulative effect of several lexical simplifications (e.g., 'functions' to 'jobs', 'difficulty in finding mates and breeding' to 'trouble finding partners and having babies', 'genetic diversity' to 'variety in their genes'), and the addition of a definition for 'species' ('which are groups of animals or plants that are similar'). While the definition aims to clarify, it introduces new semantic content not present in the original, which can subtly alter the overall meaning representation as perceived by the model. To improve, ensure that all simplifications, even minor ones, retain the full semantic weight of the original terms, and be cautious with adding explanatory text unless explicitly required, as it can sometimes dilute the original message's core meaning for the metric.",

This is because the writer's output is an exact copy of the original text, meaning no simplification was performed. The text contains vocabulary such as 'genetic', 'diversity' (B2), and 'breed' (C1), as well as complex sentence structures like 'as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.' These elements contribute to a B2 complexity level. To achieve B1 compliance, the writer must actively simplify the text. This involves replacing higher-level vocabulary with simpler synonyms (e.g., 'genetic diversity' could be 'different genes'), breaking down long or complex sentences, and ensuring that the overall structure is accessible to a B1 learner. The provided 'Vocabulary Candidates' list should be used to guide these replacements.",

While the simplified text conveys the general idea, it dilutes the specific scientific and conservation-focused meaning. For example, the original text's emphasis on 'international breeding programmes' as a core function of zoos is simplified to 'international programmes that help animals have babies.' While this explains the action, it loses the formal, structured, and strategic nature of 'breeding programmes' as a key conservation effort. Similarly, 'provide a safeguard' is simplified to 'give them protection,' which is less precise in conveying the preventative measure against genetic similarity in populations. The cumulative effect of these simplifications reduces the emphasis on the critical role of zoos in scientific conservation strategies. To improve, consider retaining more of the specific terminology or finding B1 synonyms that better capture the scientific and strategic intent, such as 'organised breeding plans' instead of just 'programmes that help animals have babies' to maintain the nuance of the original's message about conservation functions.",
