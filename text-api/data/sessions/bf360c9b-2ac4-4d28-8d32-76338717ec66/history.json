Did some genes change and give us the ability to speak? Researchers found a change in a gene that happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not have this change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. However, one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",

The sentence 'A gene is a part of your body that you get from your parents, and it controls how you grow' is 20 words long, exceeding the maximum length. The sentence 'This change seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' is also too long at 19 words. The B2-level word 'DNA' is used without a simple definition, which is a critical error. The word 'Researchers' (B2) should be replaced with a simpler alternative like 'scientists'."
