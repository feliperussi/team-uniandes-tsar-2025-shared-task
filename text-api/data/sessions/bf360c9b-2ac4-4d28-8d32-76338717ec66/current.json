    "text_translated": "We have more questions about how genes affect the brain and language. A gene is a part of your body that you get from your parents. It controls how you grow. Did some genes change and give us the ability to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene that happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems connected to speaking. It also affects how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not have this change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. However, one day the answers might be found in our DNA. DNA is the material in our bodies that contains our genes.",
