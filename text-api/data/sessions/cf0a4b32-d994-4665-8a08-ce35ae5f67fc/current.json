    "text_translated": "Asteroids are large rocks that travel through space, and they are called 'Hazardous' when they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids, but they do not expect any of them to be a danger in the next one hundred years. With the technology that is available now, NASA can follow these objects and predict a possible impact. If this happens, two different solutions could be used to protect our planet.",
