Your version changes \u2018the US invasion of Iraq\u2019 to \u2018the US war in Iraq\u2019, losing the precise reference. It also breaks \u2018reality programmes of young people competing to win a million dollars\u2019 into two sentences, diluting the original concept. Suggestion: Restore the phrase \u2018US invasion of Iraq\u2019 exactly. Suggestion: Retain \u2018reality programmes of young people competing to win a million dollars\u2019 as one unit to preserve the core message.",
