        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text is factually inaccurate due to oversimplification. The original text provides a specific definition for 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids': rocks that 'pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your output replaces this critical data point with the vague phrase 'when they fly very near to Earth'. This omission makes the definition incorrect. A2 simplification does not permit the removal of core factual information."

Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and use appropriate A2 grammar like the first conditional. Vocabulary is strictly A2, and the key term 'Asteroids' is correctly defined in simple language. The complex term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is introduced and then immediately explained, which is the correct method. No violations detected."
