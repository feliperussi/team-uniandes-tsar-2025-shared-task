    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). This is when they fly less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to follow these rocks. It can know if they are going to hit Earth. If an asteroid is a danger, NASA has two plans to protect us.",

Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and use appropriate A2 grammar like the first conditional. Vocabulary is strictly A2, and the key term 'Asteroids' is correctly defined in simple language. The complex term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is introduced and then immediately explained, which is the correct method. No violations detected.",
