This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text is framed as a scientific inquiry, posing questions about genetic influence. Your output transforms this into a series of simple, declarative facts, losing the essential meaning of scientific uncertainty and investigation.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8785 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of removing key lexical items from the original text, such as 'influence', 'mutated', 'development', and 'researchers'. While simplification is necessary, the loss of these terms has damaged the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is caused by two primary factors. First, the use of B1/B2 vocabulary ('tiny', 'gene'). Second, the use of a B1 grammatical structure in the sentence 'Scientists study how tiny (small) parts of DNA affect language.' The use of 'how' to introduce a subordinate clause is a B1-level construction.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'tiny' is B1. The word 'gene' is B2. These words are not on the A2 list and must be replaced or defined with extreme simplicity before use.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original text's meaning of scientific questioning. Do not state facts; state what scientists are trying to learn. The sentence 'Scientists study how...' must be broken down. Replace it with: 'Scientists study DNA. They want to know if parts of our DNA help us speak.' This avoids the B1 clause structure. Remove the word 'tiny' and use 'small'.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8847 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text is about 'genetics' and 'gene mutation'. Your output oversimplifies this to 'DNA' and 'change'. This simplification is too aggressive and loses the specific scientific meaning, which is why the MeaningBERT score is low.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The removal of key terms like 'gene' and 'mutation' is the direct cause of the low BERTScore. While these are not A2 words, their complete replacement with generic terms like 'DNA part' damages the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Structural Integrity: The sentence structure is appropriately simple for the A2 level. The CEFR classifier correctly rated the output as A2 based on its grammar and vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts. Use the word 'gene'. An A2-level explanation is possible. For example: 'Genes are small parts of DNA.' Then, you can say 'a change in a gene' instead of 'a DNA change'. This restores meaning and fidelity without exceeding the A2 level.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.87 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text poses a question about the influence of genetics on language. Your version transforms this into a disconnected list of facts and definitions, losing the central theme of scientific inquiry.\n\n- Extraneous Information: You added definitions for 'gene' and 'mutation'. This content was not in the original text and dilutes the intended message.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'gene' is B2 level. Its repeated use is inappropriate for an A2 text. Defining it with another complex term ('DNA') does not solve this problem.\n\n- Phrasing Inaccuracy: The original's specific phrase 'connection with speaking' was lost and replaced with the less precise 'control our mouth'. This contributes to the low BERTScore.\n\n- Over-simplification: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. This structure fragments the ideas and contributes to the overall loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to preserve the original's focus on the scientific question. Remove the added definitions. Combine short sentences to create a more logical flow. Restore the specific concept of 'speaking' to improve fidelity.",
