This is an automatic failure. The text also fails on CEFR compliance.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'influence' in the first sentence is B1 level. This is too advanced for A2.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'wonder' in the second sentence is B1 level. This is also too advanced.\n- Suggestion: Replace 'influence' with an A2 alternative like 'affect'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'They wonder if' to 'They want to know if'.",
