    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that meets all B1 requirements. The text passes all priority checks, starting with perfect factual integrity. The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.97) are very high, confirming that the original message and key details were fully preserved. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. Diagnostically, the submission excels in its qualitative aspects. The key term 'influencers' was skillfully defined within the first sentence, which is a best practice for B1 simplification. The addition of the connector 'However' improves the logical flow of the text, and expanding the contraction 'they'd' to 'they had' enhances clarity for the target reader. No further improvements are needed.",
