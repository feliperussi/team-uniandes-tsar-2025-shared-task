        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The primary goal of simplification is to preserve the original information accurately. This output fails because it adds new information that is not present in the source text. First, the original text states the friends learned to live without buying items, but the output adds the clause 'and they found simple ways to reuse what they already had'. Second, the output adds a reason for their actions by stating they gave up services 'because they wanted to keep their spending low'. The original text does not provide this reason. Simplification must not involve adding new facts or inferring motives. Despite this critical error, the submission did successfully define the keyword 'influencers' and met the B1 CEFR target as well as the MeaningBERT and BERTScore thresholds. To fix this, remove all information that was not explicitly stated in the original text.",

The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.97) are very high, confirming that the original message and key details were fully preserved. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. Diagnostically, the submission excels in its qualitative aspects. The key term 'influencers' was skillfully defined within the first sentence, which is a best practice for B1 simplification. The addition of the connector 'However' improves the logical flow of the text, and expanding the contraction 'they'd' to 'they had' enhances clarity for the target reader. No further improvements are needed.",
