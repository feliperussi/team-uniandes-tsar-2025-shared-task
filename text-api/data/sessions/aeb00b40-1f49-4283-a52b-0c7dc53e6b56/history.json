This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The original text emphasizes the subject's prestige, leadership, and high status within her field. Your simplification reduces this to being merely 'important', which is a significant downgrade in meaning.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original's emphasis on high status is lost. 'Leading researcher' becomes 'very important researcher'. 'Prestigious' becomes 'very special'. 'Highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' becomes 'important science magazines'. This pattern of over-simplification strips the text of its intended meaning about her professional standing.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation (Keywords):** The definition provided for 'AI' is unacceptable. It uses the B2 word 'means' and the B1/B2 words 'Artificial Intelligence'. A keyword definition must be written using only A2-level vocabulary. You cannot define a term using the term itself.\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n*   Rewrite the text to restore the lost meaning. You must convey the concept of 'leading' and 'prestigious' using A2-compliant language. For example, 'She is one of the best researchers' or 'She got an award that all researchers want'.\n*   Rewrite the definition for 'AI' immediately. Suggestion: 'AI is when a computer can learn and think. This is like a person's brain.'"

This score indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The simplification has stripped away the professional prestige and academic authority of the subject, which is a central theme of the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original text establishes Julie Wong as a 'leading researcher' with work in 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' who won a 'prestigious' award. Your output reduces this to 'one of the best researchers' whose work is in 'the best science magazines' and who won an award 'that many other researchers want'. This simplification loses the crucial nuance of academic rigor and high professional status.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The text uses the words 'Royal' (B1) and 'Academy' (C1) in the name of the award. For a strict A2 text, these words are too advanced, even as part of a proper noun. They must be replaced or explained in A2 terms.\n*   **Keyword Definition:** The definitions for 'Robotics' and 'AI' are adequate but could be more direct. For example: 'Robotics is making and using robots.'\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n*   **Restore Meaning:** You must rephrase the text to better convey the subject's high status. Replace 'studies' with a stronger concept. Replace 'science magazines' with a phrase that better captures the importance of 'peer-reviewed journals', such as 'special papers for other top scientists'.\n*   **Fix Vocabulary:** Remove the words 'Royal' and 'Academy'. Describe the awarding body in simple terms, for example: 'She got an important award from a top group of scientists in Britain.'"

This score quantitatively proves that the core nuance of the original text was lost during simplification.\n\n*   **Loss of Nuance:** The original text uses precise, formal language to convey professional prestige (e.g., 'leading researcher', 'highly regarded', 'prestigious'). Your output reduces this to overly simplistic terms like 'very important' and 'special papers'. This simplification strips the text of its professional tone and diminishes the subject's high status, which is a key part of the original message.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The vocabulary analysis flagged 'making' as a B2-level word in the definition 'Robotics is making and using robots.' This is a violation of the A2 standard. Every word must be strictly within the A2 vocabulary.\n*   **Factual Addition:** The output adds the detail 'in Britain' which was not explicitly in the original text. While 'Royal Academy' implies this, A2 simplification must not add information, only rephrase existing facts.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Do not just simplify words; simplify the concepts while retaining their weight. Instead of 'very important researcher', use 'one of the best researchers in her area'. Instead of 'a very important award', use 'a special prize that only top scientists receive'. Remove the word 'making' from the definition of Robotics."
