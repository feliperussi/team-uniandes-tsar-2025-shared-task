By splitting this into two sentences, the output weakens this direct link, which alters the semantic meaning.

This is likely because the original text presents the fact about the Sydney funnel-web spider as a standalone statement, while the output reframes it as 'For example...'. This addition, while logical, subtly changes the rhetorical structure and emphasis of the original message, which can lower the meaning preservation score. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. The B2 rating was likely caused by the sentence: 'For example, Australia's dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider has not caused any deaths since a special medicine called anti-venom was created in 1981.' This sentence is long and contains multiple clauses, a structure more complex than the B1 level. Suggestion: To fix both issues, remove 'For example' and split the complex sentence. Try this: 'Australia's dangerous Sydney funnel-web spider is one example. It has not caused any deaths since 1981. This is because a special medicine called anti-venom was created then.' This simplifies the structure to a B1 level and removes the phrase that likely impacted the MeaningBERT score.
