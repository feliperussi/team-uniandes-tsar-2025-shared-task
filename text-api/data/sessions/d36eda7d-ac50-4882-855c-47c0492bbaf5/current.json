The company should offer work hours that can change. It should also let people work from the place they choose. Managers need to give workers new and interesting tasks. They also need to tell workers they do a good job and show they are happy with their work. The company should spend more money to help workers learn new things for their jobs. This includes learning how to work well with people from other countries. This can help create a good work environment, so workers can do their best work.",
