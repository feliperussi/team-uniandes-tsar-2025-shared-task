This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core meaning of the original text. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of essential professional concepts.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Meaning Loss (Quantitative):** The low MeaningBERT score (0.5971) provides objective proof that the nuance and professional weight of the original recommendations were lost.\n*   **Meaning Loss (Qualitative - Recognition):** The original phrase 'positive reinforcement and recognition' is a formal business concept that includes praise, awards, promotions, and bonuses. Your simplification to 'say \"good job\" more often' reduces this complex idea to mere verbal praise, which is a severe misrepresentation of the original meaning.\n*   **Meaning Loss (Qualitative - Challenge):** The original text recommends managers 'challenge our staff'. This implies providing difficult tasks that promote growth. Your version, 'give workers interesting tasks', loses the critical concept of difficulty and development.\n*   **Meaning Loss (Qualitative - Development):** The original specifies 'professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication'. Your version, 'training... to help them talk with other people better', is a gross oversimplification. It strips away the professional context and the specific, crucial skill of 'intercultural' communication.\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n*   Rewrite the text to restore the lost meaning using A2-level vocabulary.\n*   Replace 'say \"good job\"' with a phrase that captures the broader concept of recognition, such as 'show that their work is good and important'.\n*   Replace 'interesting tasks' with a phrase that includes the idea of a challenge, such as 'give workers new tasks that help them learn'.\n*   Rephrase the training recommendation to be more specific, for example: 'training to help them work well with people from different countries'."

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and professional tone during the simplification process.\n\n*   **Loss of Professional Tone:** The original text is a formal business recommendation based on 'findings'. Your output, starting with 'Because of what we found, we think...', reduces this to a weak, informal suggestion. The professional weight is lost.\n*   **Dilution of Key Concepts:** The simplification has erased important business nuances.\n    *   Original: 'positive reinforcement and recognition' (specific management actions). Output: 'show that their work is good and important' (vague and less impactful).\n    *   Original: 'professional development' (a broad career growth concept). Output: 'training' (a much narrower term).\n*   **Weakened Language:** The phrase 'recommend that Girox Foods adopt' is a strong, direct call to action. 'we think Girox Foods should change' is hesitant and lacks authority.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the formal, authoritative tone of a recommendation. Use simple A2 language but do not discard the core business concepts. For example, rephrase the opening to 'Our report says Girox Foods needs to change...' to restore authority. Rephrase 'show that their work is good' to something more active like 'Managers need to tell workers they did a good job often'."

The primary reason for this failure is the critically low MeaningBERT score of 0.5936, which is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core meaning and nuance during the simplification process, even though the individual facts were retained.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Critical Meaning Shift (Certainty vs. Possibility):** The original text states that these changes \"could also contribute\" to a positive environment, which expresses a possibility. Your output incorrectly states, \"This will create a good work environment,\" which presents this outcome as a certainty. This is a fundamental alteration of the original message.\n*   **Loss of Formal Tone:** The original text uses the formal language of a business report: \"On the basis of these findings, we recommend...\". Your version, \"Our report says...\", is too informal and loses the crucial sense of a formal, evidence-based recommendation.\n*   **Oversimplification of Key Concepts:** The management concept of \"positive reinforcement and recognition\" was reduced to \"tell workers often that they do a good job.\" This simplification loses the important business nuance of formal recognition and behavioral encouragement.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning. Change the definitive statement \"will create\" to a phrase indicating possibility, such as \"can help create.\" You must also find a way to reintroduce the formal, advisory tone of a \"recommendation\" without using B1-level vocabulary."
