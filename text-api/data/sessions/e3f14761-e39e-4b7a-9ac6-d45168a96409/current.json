    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6649 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The over-simplification into excessively short, disconnected sentences has destroyed the original's cohesive meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8741 is below the required 0.90. Key terms like 'prehistoric times' and 'magic spells' were replaced with overly simple phrases, causing a loss of important lexical detail.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'magic' is classified as B1 but was used in the output. This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n- Grammatical Error: The sentence 'They have also found in Syria and Iraq' is incomplete. It is missing the object 'graffiti'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. Combine short, repetitive sentences using 'and'. Correct the incomplete sentence by adding the object. Replace the B1 word 'magic' with an A2 alternative. The goal is simplification, not fragmentation. The text must still read as a coherent paragraph, not a list of isolated facts.",
