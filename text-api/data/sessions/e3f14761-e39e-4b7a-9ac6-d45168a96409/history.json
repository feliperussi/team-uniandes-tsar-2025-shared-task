The correct A2 phrasing is 'a lot of graffiti'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to restore the original meaning. Example: 'The messages were about religion, politics, and love.'

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7269 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8935 is below the 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text emphasizes that graffiti has existed 'throughout history'. Your version uses simple past tenses ('drew', 'found') and phrases like 'long ago', which loses the essential meaning of continuous historical presence.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of oversimplification. Key phrases like 'prehistoric times' and 'ancient sites' were replaced with 'long ago' and 'old buildings', losing important detail and fidelity to the source.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level words 'religion' and 'politics' were used. These are not A2 vocabulary and must be simplified. For example, 'messages about gods' or 'messages about leaders'.\n\n- Grammatical Error: The sentence 'People draw on walls for a long time' uses the wrong tense. The simple present 'draw' does not fit with the duration 'for a long time'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to establish the historical context more accurately. Use more precise A2 vocabulary to improve fidelity. Replace all B1 words with A2-level descriptions. Correct the grammatical error in the second sentence.",

Your version omits 'romantic messages' entirely.\n- Vague Language: You replaced 'magic spells' with 'special words'. This is too vague and loses the specific meaning.\n- Lexical Fidelity: Replacing specific concepts like 'romantic' and 'magic' with generic terms caused the BERTScore to fall below the minimum standard.\nSuggestion: You must restore the core concepts.
