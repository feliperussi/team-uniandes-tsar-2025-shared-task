But you will almost certainly have no phone signal. Or your phone battery will die. This happens when you start to call. Sometimes, both things happen.",

The original text used 'coverage', which is also not A2, but the task was to simplify to A2. Replacing a non-A2 word with another non-A2 word (even if slightly lower level) is a failure to meet the A2 vocabulary requirement. Suggestion: Rephrase 'no phone signal' using simpler A2 words, such as 'no phone works' or 'the phone does not work'.",

The text successfully maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning with high fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.8373, BERTScore 0.9207), and is accurately classified as A2.

Sentence structures are simple and direct, using A2-appropriate connectors like 'So', 'If', 'But', 'Or', and 'when'. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
