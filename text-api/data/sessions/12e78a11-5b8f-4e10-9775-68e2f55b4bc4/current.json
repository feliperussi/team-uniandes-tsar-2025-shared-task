So, how can films keep people excited? The answer is: phones do not work! If you are a hero in a horror film, you will need to call for help. This happens at an important time. But your phone will almost certainly not work. Or your phone battery will die. This happens when you start to call. Sometimes, both things happen.",

The text successfully maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning with high fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.8373, BERTScore 0.9207), and is accurately classified as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with complex terms from the original text simplified effectively (e.g., 'protagonists' to 'main people', 'desperation' to 'very scared', 'maintain suspense' to 'keep people excited', 'coverage' to 'not work'). Sentence structures are simple and direct, using A2-appropriate connectors like 'So', 'If', 'But', 'Or', and 'when'. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
