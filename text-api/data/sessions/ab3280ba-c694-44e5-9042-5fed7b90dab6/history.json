Although NASA believes there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, so far they have only recorded about 8,000 of them, which means 17,000 have not been found yet. This is a serious issue because in 2013, a much smaller asteroid that was only 19 metres wide exploded over a city in Russia and injured 1,200 people.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. The primary cause is overly complex sentence structure. For example, the first sentence, 'NASA is now working to find and record smaller asteroids, which are large rocks that travel through space, that are 140 metres wide or more,' uses a double relative clause which is too advanced for B1. Suggestion: Split this into two or three shorter sentences, such as: 'NASA is now working to find and record smaller asteroids. Asteroids are large rocks that travel through space. NASA is looking for ones that are 140 metres wide or more.' Additionally, the second sentence is long and uses the B2-level word 'means', which also increases the complexity. Suggestion: Rephrase this using simpler connectors, for example: 'NASA believes there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. However, they have only recorded about 8,000 of them. This leaves 17,000 that have not been found yet.'",

The combination of the connector 'For this reason', the modal verb 'would', and the conditional 'if' clause creates a structure more typical of a B2 level.
