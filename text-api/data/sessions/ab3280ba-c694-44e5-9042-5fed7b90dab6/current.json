    "text_translated": "NASA is now working to find and record smaller **asteroids**. **Asteroids** are large rocks that travel through space. They are looking for asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more. NASA believes there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. However, they have only recorded about 8,000 of them, so 17,000 have not been found yet. This is a serious issue. In 2013, a much smaller asteroid exploded over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it injured 1,200 people. So, these middle-sized asteroids are a great danger if they enter the area around Earth.",

    "feedback": "The text passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with all key figures (140m, 25,000, 8,000, 17,000, 19m, 1,200) and events correctly reported. The MeaningBERT (0.856) and BERTScore (0.9195) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is highly effective. The definition of the keyword 'asteroids' is clear and well-integrated. Complex concepts like 'logging' (simplified to 'find and record') and 'Earth's orbit' (simplified to 'the area around Earth') are handled skillfully. The original text's complex sentence structure is broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, which greatly improves readability for a B1 audience. This is an excellent example of successful text simplification.",
