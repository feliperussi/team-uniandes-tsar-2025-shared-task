This sentence is too long and contains multiple clauses (a subordinate 'Although' clause, a relative 'which' clause, and an embedded 'whether/or if' question), making it difficult for a B1 reader to parse.

While the simplification successfully preserved all facts and the core meaning, it oversimplified the sentence structures. For example, the original text's use of a semicolon and the connector 'though' was removed, and the final question 'Was it using language that caused...' was simplified to the more direct 'Did using language cause...'. These changes, while grammatically correct, reduced the overall linguistic complexity too much. To fix this, consider reintroducing a B1-level connector. For instance, the first sentence could be revised to: 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we start to see evidence of early human civilisation, for example in cave paintings; however, no one knows the connection between this and language.'"

The text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning excellently, but its linguistic structure is too advanced. The main issue is the first sentence: 'Although we start to see signs of early human civilisation between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, for example in cave paintings, no one knows the connection between this and language.' This is a long, complex sentence that begins with a subordinate clause, a structure more typical of B2 level. The key vocabulary word 'civilisation' is also a B2/C1 term that contributes to the higher rating. Suggestion: To achieve a B1 classification, break the first sentence into two or three simpler sentences. For example: 'We start to see signs of early human civilisation between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. We can see this in cave paintings, for example.

This single sentence uses a subordinate clause starting with 'Although', creating a grammatical structure that is too advanced for B1 learners. To correct this, the sentence should be split into two simpler sentences.

The primary cause is the restructuring of the final two questions into a single declarative sentence. The original's direct questions ('Was it using language...? Or did their brains...?') were replaced with the more abstract phrase 'This raises the question of whether... or if...'. While the core meaning is preserved, this change is too distant from the source text, lowering the fidelity score. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, registering as B2 instead of the target B1. This is likely due to the same complex sentence structure ('This raises the question of whether... or if...'), which is too advanced for a B1 level. Suggestion: To fix both issues, revert to the simpler, two-question format of the original. For example: 'Did using language cause their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?'. This would increase the BERTScore and better align with B1 CEFR standards."

To elevate the text to a solid B1, consider reintroducing a slightly more complex sentence structure.

While the simplification is factually perfect and preserves the original meaning excellently, the sentence structures have been made too simple for the target level.

For example, the sentence 'Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but humans became more complex and intelligent' is a simple compound structure more typical of the A2 level. To reach B1, consider reintroducing slightly more complex sentence patterns. For instance, combining ideas using a subordinate clause, such as 'Although human brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent,' would add the necessary complexity for a B1 classification."

The factual content and core meaning were preserved well, but the grammatical structure is too advanced. The main issue is the second sentence: 'Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, yet humans became more complex and intelligent, which leads to the question of whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' This sentence is overly long and uses multiple complex structures (a non-defining relative clause with 'which', followed by 'whether... or if...'). This significantly increases the cognitive load for a B1 reader. Suggestion: Retain the simpler structure of the original text by splitting this into shorter sentences. For example: 'Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, yet humans became more complex and intelligent. This leads to a question. Did using language cause their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?' This revised structure maintains the B1 level by presenting the core ideas in more manageable parts."

Second, the retention of B2-level vocabulary like 'civilisation'. To meet the B1 requirement, break down long sentences into shorter ones.

The primary reason for the A2 classification is the over-simplification of sentence structure. The original complex sentence was split into two short, simple sentences. Furthermore, the B1-level connector 'yet' was replaced with the more basic A-level connector 'but'. To elevate the text to B1, consider re-combining the first two sentences using a B1 connector. For example: 'We start to see evidence of early human society between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago through cave paintings, although the connection between this and language is unknown.' This would restore the necessary sentence complexity for the target level."

This reduction in grammatical complexity is the likely reason for the A2 classification. To reach the B1 target, consider combining some ideas to create more varied sentence structures.
