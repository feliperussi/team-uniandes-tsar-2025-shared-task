    "text_translated": "Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we start to see evidence of early human society, for example through cave paintings. However, the connection between this and language is unknown. Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but humans became more complex and intelligent. This leads to a question. Did using language cause their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully meets all B1 criteria. The output passes all priority checks, maintaining perfect factual integrity and achieving high scores for meaning (MeaningBERT 0.91) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.97). The structural changes are particularly effective for a B1 audience. Splitting the first complex sentence and introducing the B1 connector 'However' greatly improves readability. Furthermore, the addition of the sentence 'This leads to a question' provides excellent scaffolding, clearly signaling the shift from statements to the final inquiry. The vocabulary substitution of 'civilisation' with 'society' is also a well-judged simplification. No further improvements are necessary.",
