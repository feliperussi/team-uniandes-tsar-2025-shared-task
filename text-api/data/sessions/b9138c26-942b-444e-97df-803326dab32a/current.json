Baboons are an endangered type of animal. This shows there are not many of these animals left. People want to save them. They also want to make problems between baboons and people smaller. So, the city leaders give jobs to a team of Baboon Monitors. These monitors make baboons leave city areas. Or they catch them and let them go in the countryside. This plan helps a little. But it is hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city. They come back because they find easy food there.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to the CEFR A2 readability standard. All diagnostic checks were passed successfully. The factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning and fidelity to the original text are preserved, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7843 (above 0.75) and a BERTScore of 0.9306 (above 0.90). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms that vocabulary has been consistently simplified to A2 or A1 levels, avoiding any B1/B2 words. Complex sentence structures from the original have been effectively broken down into short, simple sentences, and connectors are limited to appropriate A2 conjunctions such as 'So', 'Or', 'But', and 'because'. This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
