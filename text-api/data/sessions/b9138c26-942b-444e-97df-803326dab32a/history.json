While the individual facts are present, the core message and nuances of the original text have been diluted through oversimplification and fragmentation. For example, 'Baboons are an endangered species' is reduced to 'Not many baboons are left', losing the specific meaning of a conservation status. Similarly, 'minimise conflicts between humans and baboons' becomes 'stop problems with people', which is less precise. The causal link 'once they see it as a source of easy food' is broken into separate sentences, weakening the explanation of why baboons return. This fragmentation of ideas into excessively short sentences, while aiming for A2, has inadvertently stripped the text of its original semantic depth. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific meaning of terms like 'endangered species' and 'minimise conflicts'. Reconnect fragmented ideas to preserve causal relationships and the overall flow of information, ensuring the core message is fully conveyed.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6404 is below the required 0.75. While the factual information is largely present, the nuanced meaning and precision of the original text have been significantly diluted. Specific examples include: 1. The original 'Cape Town can be a dangerous place' implies potential, whereas 'Cape Town is not safe' is a definitive statement, altering the nuance. 2. 'Electrocuted' (implying severe injury or death from electric shock) was simplified to 'get a bad electric shock', which is less precise and less severe. 3. 'Endangered species' (a specific biological classification) was generalized to 'endangered animal', losing the scientific precision. 4. 'Minimise conflicts' (implying reduction) was changed to 'stop problems' (implying complete cessation), altering the scope of the action. 5. 'City council has employed' (formal hiring) was simplified to 'city leaders have' (general possession/responsibility), losing the formality and specific action. 6. 'Urban areas' and 'countryside' (specific geographical terms) were generalized to 'city' and 'nature' (broader concepts), reducing specificity. These cumulative changes result in a loss of the original message's fidelity, despite maintaining the basic facts. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain the specific nuances and precision of the original text while still adhering to A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, use phrases like 'can be dangerous' instead of 'is not safe', and find A2-appropriate ways to convey the specific meaning of 'electrocuted' or 'species'.",

The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms that vocabulary has been consistently simplified to A2 or A1 levels, avoiding any B1/B2 words. Complex sentence structures from the original have been effectively broken down into short, simple sentences, and connectors are limited to appropriate A2 conjunctions such as 'So', 'Or', 'But', and 'because'. This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
