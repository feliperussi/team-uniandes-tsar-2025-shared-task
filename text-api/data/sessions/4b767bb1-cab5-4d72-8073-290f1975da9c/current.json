    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6274 is significantly below the required threshold of 0.75. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The original text frames collapses as 'mysteries' that engineers 'realise' the cause of after an 'investigation'. Your version, 'At first, nobody knows why. Engineers must do a complete study to find the reason,' loses this specific nuance of discovery and mystery.\n- The original states a cause could be a 'defect in a key piece'. Your translation, 'an important part of the bridge was broken,' is a significant change in meaning. A 'defect' is a flaw and does not necessarily mean the part is 'broken'. This inaccuracy is a primary contributor to the low meaning score.\n- While the text successfully meets the A2 classification for vocabulary and sentence structure, the failure to maintain the original meaning is an absolute disqualification.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. The concept of a 'defect' or 'flaw' must be retained. The relationship between a 'mystery' and an 'investigation' must be made clearer. Rephrase to capture the idea that engineers discover the reason, rather than just studying it.",
