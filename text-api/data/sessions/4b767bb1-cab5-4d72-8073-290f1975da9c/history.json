The text fails to preserve the core message of the original. The primary issue is the shift from factual discovery to speculation. The original text presents reasons for collapse as findings from an investigation. Your version weakens this by using 'Maybe', which changes the meaning from a conclusion to a possibility. For example, 'inferior-quality material was used' becomes 'Maybe the material... was bad'. Additionally, the phrase 'special amount of weight' is an inaccurate simplification of 'a certain amount of weight'. 'Certain' refers to a specific, calculated limit, while 'special' implies the weight is unusual. This also contributes to the meaning drift. Suggestion: Rephrase to remove speculation. State the reasons as findings. Replace 'Maybe the material... was bad' with 'Sometimes, the material was bad'. Replace 'special amount' with 'a specific amount' or 'only some weight'.",
