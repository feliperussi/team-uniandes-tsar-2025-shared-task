MeaningBERT (0.908) and BERTScore (0.9438) both exceed the required thresholds, and the text is correctly classified at the B1 level. Sentence splitting and connectors (Over the last two centuries, This led to, In the 1960s, After that) create a clear and logical flow. You also properly defined the keyword contraception. To refine further, consider reintroducing the word global for clarity (average number of babies per woman worldwide) and using the plural form \u2019women getting pregnant\u2019 for greater grammatical consistency. You might also vary your vocabulary slightly by replacing \u2018more common\u2019 with alternatives like \u2018wider\u2019 or \u2018greater\u2019 availability to avoid repetition.",
