    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks that fly through space. Some of these asteroids could be dangerous. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' because they can pass very close to Earth, inside a distance of 7.5 million kilometres. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these special asteroids. However, none of them are a danger for the next one hundred years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects. They can also know in advance if one might hit Earth. If that happens, there are two ways to protect our planet.",
