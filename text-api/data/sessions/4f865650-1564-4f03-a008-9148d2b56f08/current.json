    "text_translated": "NASA is now working to find and record some of the smaller asteroids. Asteroids are large rocks that travel through space. NASA is looking for asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more, and it thinks there are about 25,000 of this size. They have found about 8,000 of them so far, but this means there are still 17,000 that have not been found. These middle-sized asteroids could be a serious danger if they come close to Earth. For example, a much smaller 19-metre asteroid injured 1,200 people when it exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013.",
