He is still making new music that is very popular and fills big stadiums, and he is still doing very well, even though he is almost 70 years old. This does not surprise me, because he is a man who tells us the most important stories about who we are. When you listen to his song 'Born in the USA', for example, those stories are still important today, just like they always were.",

The simplification strategy was too aggressive, leading to a loss of B1-level complexity. For example, the original phrase 'chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game' was simplified to 'new music that is very popular and fills big stadiums, and he is still doing very well'. While this makes the text easier, it removes B1 vocabulary and more complex grammatical structures. Similarly, 'our most fundamental stories about ourselves' became 'the most important stories about who we are'. To achieve B1, the text should retain some of the more nuanced vocabulary and slightly more complex sentence structures, while still simplifying where necessary. Consider retaining some B1 vocabulary like 'chart-topping' or 'at the top of his game' and using a wider range of B1 connectors and sentence structures.",

The first sentence, 'Unlike many other best-selling artists who stop making new music, Bruce Springsteen is still releasing chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game in his late 60s,' is too long and contains complex phrasing. Specifically, 'remains at the top of his game' is an idiomatic expression that is B2 level, and 'chart-topping, stadium-filling' are compound adjectives that increase complexity. The word 'fundamental' in the second sentence is also B2 vocabulary. To achieve B1, consider breaking down longer sentences, simplifying idiomatic expressions, and replacing higher-level vocabulary. For example, 'remains at the top of his game' could be simplified to 'is still very successful' or 'is still performing very well'. 'Fundamental' could be 'most important' or 'basic'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.854 and BERTScore of 0.949 are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and key lexical content. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, confirming its suitability for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex sentence structures, such as breaking down the original's long opening sentence into three more manageable sentences. For instance, 'chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game' was skillfully rephrased as 'new music. His music is popular and fills stadiums. He is still very successful.' Vocabulary was appropriately simplified, with phrases like 'at the top of his game' becoming 'very successful' and 'fundamental stories' becoming 'most important stories.' The use of B1-appropriate connectors like 'even though' and 'because' enhances the text's coherence and flow, making it more accessible without losing its natural rhythm. This is a well-executed simplification.",
