    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards. It maintains factual integrity and core meaning, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.802 and BERTScore of 0.9209, both well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with complex terms like 'Summits' and 'empower' effectively simplified to 'tall mountains' and 'help women and girls be strong'. Sentence structures are uniformly short and simple, and the use of connectors is appropriately limited to A2-level conjunctions like 'but'. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
