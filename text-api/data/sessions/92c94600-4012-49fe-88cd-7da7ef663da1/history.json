The text fails to fully capture the core message and purpose of Wasfia's actions. The original text emphasizes 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' as the direct reason for her hula-hooping on the peaks. Your version simplifies this to 'She did this to help women and girls. She wants them to feel strong. In her country, people say no to girls doing sport.' This simplification loses the direct link between her specific action (hula-hooping on peaks) and the concept of 'empowerment' as a challenge to societal norms. 'Help' and 'feel strong' are weaker and less direct than 'empower' in this context. The nuance of her actions as a direct act of defiance and inspiration is diminished. Suggestion: Rephrase the purpose of her actions to more strongly convey the idea of challenging norms and empowering women through her specific achievements, ensuring the connection between her actions and the impact is clear and strong, while remaining within A2 vocabulary.",

This indicates a significant failure to preserve the core message of the original text. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score: The score of 0.6627 is too low. The original text's nuance of Wasfia 'reluctantly' watching is lost when simplified to 'Wasfia stood and watched. She did not play.' This removes the implied internal conflict and desire to participate. \n- MeaningBERT Score: The concept of 'empower women and girls' is simplified to 'wanted them to feel strong'. While simpler, 'feel strong' does not fully capture the active and transformative meaning of 'empowerment'. Similarly, 'discourages them from doing sport' is weakened to 'Her country does not want girls to do sport', losing the active sense of opposition. \n- MeaningBERT Score: The inclusion of explicit definitions for 'hula hoop' and 'Summits' at the beginning and within the narrative, while potentially useful for A2, adds content not present in the original text. This additional content dilutes the semantic similarity between the output and the original, contributing to the lower MeaningBERT score. The task is to rewrite the original narrative, not to insert separate definitional sections.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the section about Wasfia watching to convey her internal desire to play despite societal rules, to better capture the meaning of 'reluctantly'.\n- Strengthen the language used to simplify 'empower' and 'discourages' to retain more of their original intensity and meaning while remaining within A2 vocabulary. For example, 'make women and girls strong and able to choose' for 'empower', and 'her country tells girls not to do sport' for 'discourages'.\n- Integrate any necessary definitions more subtly into the narrative flow, or ensure that added definitional content does not significantly detract from the overall semantic similarity to the original text.",

The core message and nuances of the original text have been lost or distorted. Specific deviations are listed below: - The original text states Wasfia 'reluctantly stood by and watched, as in her country it was believed that girls should not play'. Your version simplifies this to 'Wasfia watched. She wanted to play. But girls in her country must not play'. This loses the crucial nuance of 'reluctantly' and the societal 'belief' system, replacing it with a direct, absolute 'must not' rule and an inferred desire. - The original text's purpose 'to empower women and girls' is simplified to 'make women and girls strong. She wanted them to choose'. While 'make strong' is acceptable, adding 'She wanted them to choose' introduces a new concept not explicitly present in 'empower', thus altering the original meaning. - The original phrase 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' is simplified to 'Her country tells girls not to do sport'. This is a less nuanced and less accurate representation of 'discourages'. Suggestion: Rephrase the initial sentences to convey the societal belief and Wasfia's reluctance more accurately. Ensure 'empower' is translated with a single, direct A2 equivalent that captures its full meaning, or break it down into components that are directly supported by the original text. Restore the nuance of 'discourages' rather than a direct command.",

It maintains factual integrity and core meaning, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.802 and BERTScore of 0.9209, both well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with complex terms like 'Summits' and 'empower' effectively simplified to 'tall mountains' and 'help women and girls be strong'. Sentence structures are uniformly short and simple, and the use of connectors is appropriately limited to A2-level conjunctions like 'but'. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
