This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Meaning Deviation: The original text asks if animals are considered a 'danger or a pest'. Your version simplifies this to only 'are they a danger?'. This completely removes the concept of animals being an annoyance or a nuisance ('pest'), which is a key part of the original question.\n\n- Factual Inaccuracy: The original text lists 'birds, squirrels, mice and insects' as examples. Your output omits 'insects'. Any omission of factual detail is an immediate failure.\n\n- Lexical Simplification Error: While simplification is required, changing 'the world's press' to 'Newspapers and TV' contributes to the loss of meaning and fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the full meaning of the final question to include the concept of a 'pest'. Ensure all factual examples from the original text, such as 'insects', are included in your output. The goal is simplification, not omission of key concepts and facts.",
