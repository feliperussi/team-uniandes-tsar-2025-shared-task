    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n- Vocabulary Compliance: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. Complex words from the original, such as 'pest' (B1) and 'considered' (B1), were correctly simplified to 'problem' (A1) or removed entirely.\n- Structural Simplicity: The original text's longer sentences have been expertly broken down into short, clear, and independent statements. This demonstrates perfect adherence to A2 structural requirements.\n- Metric Adherence: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. The BERTScore of 0.9331 and MeaningBERT of 0.7698 confirm that meaning and key details were preserved with high fidelity.\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, including the types of animals and their locations, are perfectly preserved from the original text. The output is a flawless A2 adaptation.",
