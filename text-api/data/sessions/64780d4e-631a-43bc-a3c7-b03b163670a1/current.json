    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6238 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text's central theme is empowerment against societal discouragement. The phrase 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' is a powerful statement. Your version weakens this message to 'She wanted to help women and girls feel strong and do sports.' The word 'empower' is much stronger than 'help... feel strong'. Similarly, 'discourages them' is a systemic issue, which you have reduced to 'some people say girls should not do sport'. This loses the force of the original's intent. While the text is factually correct and uses A2 vocabulary, the loss of the central, motivating idea is a severe error. Suggestion: The final paragraph must be rewritten to restore the original meaning. You must capture the concepts of 'empowerment' and 'discouragement' using A2 language. For example: 'She did this to show women and girls they can be powerful, even when their country tells them they cannot do sports.'",
