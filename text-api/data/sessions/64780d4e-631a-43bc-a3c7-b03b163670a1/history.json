This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text's purpose is stated as 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your version, 'She wanted to give women and girls more power and help them do difficult things,' is a vague and weak interpretation. 'Help them do difficult things' does not carry the same meaning as overcoming societal discouragement and achieving empowerment.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8989 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is caused by replacing precise phrasing like 'reluctantly stood by' and 'discourages them' with simpler, but less accurate, alternatives.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text sound unnatural and overly simplistic, even for an A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: The final paragraph must be rewritten to restore the original meaning. Focus on the concept of 'empowerment' against societal rules. A more accurate A2 phrasing would be: 'She did this to show that women and girls can be powerful and do sports, even when some people in her country say they should not.'",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text's central theme is empowerment against societal discouragement. The phrase 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' is a powerful statement. Your version weakens this message to 'She wanted to help women and girls feel strong and do sports.' The word 'empower' is much stronger than 'help... feel strong'. Similarly, 'discourages them' is a systemic issue, which you have reduced to 'some people say girls should not do sport'. This loses the force of the original's intent. While the text is factually correct and uses A2 vocabulary, the loss of the central, motivating idea is a severe error. Suggestion: The final paragraph must be rewritten to restore the original meaning. You must capture the concepts of 'empowerment' and 'discouragement' using A2 language. For example: 'She did this to show women and girls they can be powerful, even when their country tells them they cannot do sports.'",
