They did not pay enough money to the people who gave them the food. They also used too much plastic for their packaging. Packaging is the material, like plastic, that covers food in a shop. This was bad for our environment. But now, supermarkets are starting to listen. People are very angry about all the plastic waste. So, some big supermarkets in the UK made a promise. They are going to change their packaging and use less plastic.",

        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates the strict A2 vocabulary rule. The word 'waste' is B1 level and was used in the sentence 'People are very angry about all the plastic waste.' The goal is to use vocabulary the student already possesses, not to teach new B1 terms. While the simplification of complex sentences and the definition of 'packaging' are adequate, this single vocabulary error results in an immediate failure."
