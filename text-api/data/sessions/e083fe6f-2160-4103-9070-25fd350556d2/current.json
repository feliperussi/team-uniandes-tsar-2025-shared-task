They have found a mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be related to speech and to the way our brains control the mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar DNA part, but they do not have this mutation. It is too early to say how much DNA influences language, but one day the answers may be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. The simplification was too aggressive. While the text is factually correct and successfully preserves the original meaning (as shown by the high MeaningBERT and BERTScore), its structure is overly simple for the target level. The original complex sentence about the discovery was broken into two very short, simple sentences: 'They have found a mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be related to speech...'. This pattern of short sentences makes the text choppy and lacks the sentence variety expected at a B1 level. Suggestion: To reach B1, combine some of these shorter sentences using B1-level connectors or relative clauses. For example: 'They have found a mutation from that period which seems to be related to speech and the way our brains control the mouth and face.' This creates a more complex sentence appropriate for the target audience. On a positive note, the keyword 'mutation' was defined perfectly.",
