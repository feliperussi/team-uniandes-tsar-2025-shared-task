This changes the tone from a general inquiry to a specific action, which likely caused the drop in the meaning score. Additionally, the text fails on CEFR compliance, being classified as A2 instead of the target B1. This is due to the overuse of short, simple sentences like 'Researchers found a mutation.

The sentence structures are too basic and lack the complexity expected at the B1 level. For example, the original complex sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation... which seems to have a connection...' was split into two very simple sentences. While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well, as confirmed by high BERTScore and MeaningBERT metrics, it does not meet the target proficiency level. To improve, try to combine some of the shorter sentences using B1-level connectors to create more varied and slightly more complex structures.

The first sentence, 'Many questions remain about how genetics affects brain and language development, and researchers wonder whether a mutation (a change in a gene) gave humans the ability to speak,' is a 30-word compound-complex sentence that is too difficult for the B1 level. The use of the connector 'although' in a later sentence also increases the complexity. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, split the first sentence into two simpler ideas. For example: 'Many questions remain about how genetics affects language. Researchers wonder if a special change in a gene, called a mutation, gave humans the ability to speak.' Also, consider replacing 'although' with 'but'. On a positive note, the text passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, and the keyword 'mutation' was correctly defined.",

While the text is factually correct and successfully preserves the original meaning (as shown by the high MeaningBERT and BERTScore), its structure is overly simple for the target level. The original complex sentence about the discovery was broken into two very short, simple sentences: 'They have found a mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This mutation seems to be related to speech...'. This pattern of short sentences makes the text choppy and lacks the sentence variety expected at a B1 level. Suggestion: To reach B1, combine some of these shorter sentences using B1-level connectors or relative clauses. For example: 'They have found a mutation from that period which seems to be related to speech and the way our brains control the mouth and face.' This creates a more complex sentence appropriate for the target audience. On a positive note, the keyword 'mutation' was defined perfectly.",
