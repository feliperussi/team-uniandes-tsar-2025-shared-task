For example, the original complex idea '...meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth' was broken into two separate, simple sentences. To achieve a B1 level, try to combine some of these ideas using B1 connectors like 'which' or 'after'. For instance, 'However, after contraception became more available in the 1960s, the average number of babies per woman went down.' On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, the meaning preservation scores are excellent, and the keyword 'contraception' was correctly defined.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is due to overly complex sentence structures that are not appropriate for the B1 level. The final sentence, 'However, after contraception, which means using methods to stop a woman from becoming pregnant, became more available in the 1960s, the global average number of babies per woman has gone down from six to as low as two,' is the primary reason for this misclassification. It contains multiple nested clauses, which is a feature of B2-level writing. Suggestion: Break this complex sentence into several shorter ones. For example: 'Contraception means using methods to stop a woman from becoming pregnant. After this became more available in the 1960s, the average number of babies per woman went down. The global average dropped from six to as low as two.' On a positive note, the text successfully passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks, and the keyword 'contraception' was correctly defined.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly meets the B1 CEFR target. The handling of the keyword 'contraception' is a model of best practice; the definition provided is clear, simple, and well-integrated into the text flow. Furthermore, the structural simplification, such as splitting the final complex sentence into two shorter ones, significantly improves readability for the target audience. Vocabulary choices are excellent, with phrases like 'grew up to become adults' being a clear and effective replacement for 'survived into adulthood'.",
