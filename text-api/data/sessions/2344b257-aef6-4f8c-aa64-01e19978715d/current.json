    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully passes all evaluation priorities. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly meets the B1 CEFR target. The handling of the keyword 'contraception' is a model of best practice; the definition provided is clear, simple, and well-integrated into the text flow. Furthermore, the structural simplification, such as splitting the final complex sentence into two shorter ones, significantly improves readability for the target audience. Vocabulary choices are excellent, with phrases like 'grew up to become adults' being a clear and effective replacement for 'survived into adulthood'.",
