    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some of these rocks can be dangerous to Earth. If they fly near Earth, we call them 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). Near is less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them is a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to follow these objects. It can see if an asteroid is going to hit Earth. If an asteroid becomes a danger, NASA has two ways to keep us safe.",
