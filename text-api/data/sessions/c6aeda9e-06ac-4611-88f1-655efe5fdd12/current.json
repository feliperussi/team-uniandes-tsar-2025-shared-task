    "feedback": "PASS: Full Compliance. The output meets all A2 standard requirements without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, names, and numbers from the original text are correctly represented.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7871 and BERTScore of 0.9051 are above the required thresholds, confirming preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Complex B1/B2 concepts were successfully rephrased using A2 structures and vocabulary. For example, 'peer-reviewed journals' was correctly simplified to 'very good science magazines. Other scientists check the papers first.' and 'international conferences' became 'meetings for scientists in different countries'. The sentence structure is consistently simple and direct. No vocabulary above the A2 level was used. The submission is approved.",
