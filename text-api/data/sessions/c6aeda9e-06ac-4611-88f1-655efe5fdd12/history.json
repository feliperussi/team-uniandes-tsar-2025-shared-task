The primary failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6601, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8934, which is below the required 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.6601): The original text's core message is about elite status and high achievement, using words like 'leading', 'highly regarded', and 'prestigious'. Your output reduces this to 'important', which is a significant loss of meaning. The text is no longer about an expert at the top of her field; it is merely about a person with an important job.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8934): The score is too low because key lexical items were over-simplified or removed. Replacing 'leading researcher' with 'important researcher' and 'prestigious...fellowship' with 'very important prize' caused a loss of factual detail that dropped the score below the minimum threshold.\n\n- The definitions provided for 'AI' and 'smart home' are acceptable for A2, but they do not compensate for the core meaning loss in the main text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the core meaning of high achievement and expertise. The word 'important' is not strong enough. You must convey the concept of being a top expert without using B1/B2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Restore more specific, simplified terms for 'journals' and 'conferences' to increase fidelity.",

'Peer-reviewed journals' was simplified to 'science magazines', which is factually inaccurate and diminishes the academic achievement.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten.

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The simplification has removed the sense of importance and high achievement central to the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8893 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing specific, impactful words with overly generic substitutes. Key lexical detail was lost.\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text emphasizes the high status of the researcher's work ('leading', 'highly regarded', 'prestigious'). Your version reduces these concepts to generic words like 'top' and 'special', which do not carry the same weight. The meaning of her accomplishments has been diluted.\n- Example of Meaning Loss: Changing 'prestigious... fellowship' to 'a special prize' loses the core concept of a highly respected and competitive award. The explanation 'Only the best researchers can win this prize' helps, but the initial simplification is too severe.\n\nSuggestion: Do not replace key concepts with generic words. Retain the original term and explain it in a simple follow-up sentence. For example: 'She was awarded the prestigious Royal Academy fellowship. Prestigious means it is a very important prize that many people respect.' This preserves both fidelity and meaning while maintaining A2 readability.",

The BERTScore of 0.892 is below the required 0.90. These failures indicate that the core message and lexical fidelity of the original text were lost during simplification. The CEFR classifier also incorrectly rated the text as B1, a direct violation of the A2 requirement.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score is too low. Adding multiple explanatory sentences like 'This means she is one of the most important researchers' and 'AI is when computers can think' diluted the original message and lowered the score.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low. The text did not maintain enough of the original's key phrasing, resulting in a loss of fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier result is B1, not A2. This is unacceptable.\n- Vocabulary Violation: B1 and C1 words were retained ('leading', 'highly', 'prestigious', 'royal', 'academy'). Defining a complex word is not a substitute for replacing it with an A2 equivalent. The word 'means' is B2 level.\n- Structural Violation: The defining clause 'AI is when computers can think' is a B1 structure. The rhetorical device 'This means...' is too complex for A2.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Remove all explanatory sentences that were not in the original text. This will improve meaning and fidelity scores.\n- Suggestion: Replace all vocabulary above A2 level. Do not define them; replace them. 'Leading' must become 'very important'. 'Prestigious' must become 'a very important award'. 'Highly regarded' must become 'very good'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase complex definitions. Change 'AI is when computers can think' to a simple A2 sentence like 'AI helps computers to think'.",
