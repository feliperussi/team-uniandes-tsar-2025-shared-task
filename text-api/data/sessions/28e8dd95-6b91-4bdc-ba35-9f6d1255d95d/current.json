    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification and passes all diagnostic checks without deviation.\n\nFactual Integrity: All facts and figures from the original text (140 metres, 25,000, 8,000, 17,000, 19 metres, 2013, 1,200 people) are present and accurate.\n\nMetrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.91 are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details.\n\nCEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text exclusively uses linguistic features appropriate for this level.\n\nQualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structure is consistently simple, utilizing short sentences and basic connectors ('so', 'but'). Complex concepts such as 'enter Earth's orbit' have been perfectly simplified to A2-appropriate phrases like 'come near our world'. The keyword 'asteroids' is defined immediately in the first sentence using simple terms. The submission demonstrates a complete and meticulous adherence to the A2 standard.",
