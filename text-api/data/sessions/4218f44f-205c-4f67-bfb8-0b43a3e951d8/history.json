        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6798, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the original text's core message. The low score was likely caused by the extensive restructuring of the original's final, dense sentence into five separate, simpler sentences. While intended to simplify, this broke apart the cause-and-effect relationship and diluted the semantic content, leading to the metric failure. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check. The output was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the use of more complex sentence structures such as the abstract noun phrase 'The hope is that...' and the conditional clause 'If this happens, telescopes on Earth will be able to see the change.' To improve, try to combine some of the shorter sentences to better preserve the logical flow of the original, and rephrase the more complex grammatical structures into simpler, more direct statements.",

This slight drop in meaning is likely due to the change from the original's 'hopefully the impact... will knock it out' to the output's 'The plan is to see if the impact... can push the moon'. This alters the original's tone of hopeful certainty to a more neutral, experimental one. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR compliance check. The classifier rated the output as 'B2', which is too complex for the target 'B1' level. This B2 classification is likely caused by the combination of the full technical name 'Double Asteroid Redirection Test' and the sentence structure 'This change should be big enough for telescopes on Earth to notice.' To fix this, first, rephrase the sentence about the impact to better capture the original's hopeful tone, for example: 'Scientists hope the impact of DART will push the moon from its path.' Second, to achieve a B1 level, consider simplifying the sentence structure further. For instance, 'Telescopes on Earth should be able to notice this change.'
