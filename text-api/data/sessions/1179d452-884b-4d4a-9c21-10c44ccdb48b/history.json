Tributes are teenagers that people choose to fight in the Games. Each year, they choose one boy and one girl. They are 12 to 18 years old. People pick them from each area by picking names from a box. The tributes must fight each other. Only one person can live. Everyone in the country must watch it on TV.",

Your version loses the core idea of the Capitol reminding districts that they are punished for rebelling. For example, you write \u201careas fought back before\u201d which does not convey \u2018punishment reminder\u2019. Suggestion: explicitly use \u2018punish\u2019 or \u2018punishment\u2019 and include \u2018rebel\u2019 or \u2018rebelling\u2019 to restore the original meaning.",
