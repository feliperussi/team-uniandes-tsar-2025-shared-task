    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6973 is below the required 0.75. Your version loses the core idea of the Capitol reminding districts that they are punished for rebelling. For example, you write \u201careas fought back before\u201d which does not convey \u2018punishment reminder\u2019. Suggestion: explicitly use \u2018punish\u2019 or \u2018punishment\u2019 and include \u2018rebel\u2019 or \u2018rebelling\u2019 to restore the original meaning.",
