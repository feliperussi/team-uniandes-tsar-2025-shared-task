    "feedback": "This is a strong PASS. The output successfully passes all priority checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. The strategy of breaking down long sentences into shorter ones was effective for achieving B1 clarity. The keyword 'evolutionary biologists' was handled perfectly with a clear parenthetical definition. For improvement, consider the flow in the middle of the text. The repetition of 'It also matters...' makes the text slightly choppy. A more significant issue is the final sentence structure: 'Evolutionary biologists (scientists who study how species change over time) study how living things change over time.' The main clause here is redundant because it repeats information already given in the definition. A more concise version would be: 'Evolutionary biologists (scientists who study how species change over time) can only guess if early humans used basic sounds to communicate before that time.'",
