        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates the strict A2 vocabulary rule. The word 'teenagers' is B1 level. Replace it with 'young people' or 'the chosen boy and girl'. Additionally, the sentence 'The chosen teenagers are called 'tributes'' uses a passive voice structure ('are called'). While this is a common form, active voice is required for strict A2 adherence. The simplification of complex ideas like 'punished for rebelling' into 'hurt the people... because the people did not follow the rules' is otherwise acceptable."

Complex concepts like 'rebelling' and 'punished' are expertly simplified to 'did not follow the rules' and 'hurt the people'. The keyword 'tributes' is correctly identified and defined in simple terms. Sentence structure is consistently simple and declarative. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained."
