    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to hurt the people. They do this because the people did not follow the rules. Every year, they pick one boy and one girl from each part of the country. The children are between 12 and 18 years old. They must fight each other. Only one person can stay alive. The name for these young people is 'tributes'. A tribute is a person who has to fight in the games. All the people in the country must watch the games on TV.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level (e.g., 'government', 'hurt', 'fight'). Complex concepts like 'rebelling' and 'punished' are expertly simplified to 'did not follow the rules' and 'hurt the people'. The keyword 'tributes' is correctly identified and defined in simple terms. Sentence structure is consistently simple and declarative. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained.",
