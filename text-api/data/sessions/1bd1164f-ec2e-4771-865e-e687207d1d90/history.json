It presents two separate facts but loses the essential meaning that one caused the other.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. The sentence 'It will be a problem we cannot solve' uses a defining relative clause, which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1-level word 'marine' is used. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard. The term 'marine protected areas' was a keyword for definition, not for direct use.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the cause-and-effect relationships lost during simplification. Rephrase 'The reefs turned white. The water got hotter' to 'The reefs turned white because the water got hotter.' Eliminate the B1 relative clause in the final sentence; split it into two A2 sentences. Replace the C1 word 'marine' with a simple A2 description like 'ocean' or 'sea'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5972 is far below the required 0.75. The BERTScore of 0.8585 is below the 0.90 threshold.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8437 also fails to meet the minimum 0.90, confirming a significant loss of key phrasing.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The text has been oversimplified into a series of short, disconnected statements. This fragmentation destroys the logical connections present in the original text, resulting in the unacceptable meaning preservation scores. For example, breaking the conditional warning into three separate, choppy sentences ('If we do not care for the sea. A big problem will appear. We cannot solve that problem.') loses the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n- Secondary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct violation of the CEFR target. The sentence fragment 'If we do not care for the sea.' is a grammatical error. It is an incomplete conditional clause, a structure that, even when written correctly, is borderline B1. Leaving it as a fragment is an immediate failure.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is not a coherent paragraph; it is a list of simple sentences. This is not acceptable A2 writing. The goal is simplification, not deconstruction.\n\nSuggestion: Reconstruct the text. Combine fragmented sentences to restore logical flow. Ensure every sentence is a complete grammatical unit. The conditional statement must be a single sentence. Correction: 'If we do not care for the sea, a big problem that we cannot solve will appear.'",

The original text's core message of urgency and severe consequence has been diluted to the point of misrepresentation.\n\nMeaning Loss: The original phrase 'reverse the damage' implies a difficult, active process. Your replacement, 'stop the harm', is weak and fails to capture this meaning. Similarly, 'an unsolvable problem' is a dire warning, which is lost in your flat statement 'a problem will appear. We cannot solve it.'\n\nFidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.891 is below the 0.90 minimum. This confirms a loss of important lexical detail from the source text.\n\nCEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. The C1-level word 'marine' is the direct cause. Defining a complex word does not negate its impact on the readability score. The text is not A2 compliant if it contains C1 vocabulary.\n\nStructural Weakness: The repetition in 'He wants them to rise from three out of one hundred. He wants them to rise to ten out of one hundred.' is poor style and not an effective simplification.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning's intensity. The concept of 'reversing damage' must be communicated more strongly. The final warning about an 'unsolvable problem' must be a single, impactful idea. Do not use C1 vocabulary. Introduce the concept using A2 words first, for example: 'There are special safe places in the sea. These are called marine protected areas.'",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.58 is drastically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of meaning. The simplification was too aggressive, reducing the original's urgent call to action into a flat list of facts. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.84 is below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key lexical items.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original phrase 'in an attempt to reverse the damage' conveys a strong sense of purpose and correction. Your version, 'He wants to stop the bad things', is vague and loses this critical meaning.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure. The cause is the use of sentence structures that are too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Sentence Structure: The sentence 'He wants to stop the bad things that happen to the sea' uses a relative 'that-clause', which is a B1 structure.\n\n- B1 Sentence Structure: The sentence 'Not protecting the sea will cause a big problem' uses a gerund phrase as the subject, another B1-level construction.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1 word 'marine' was used from the key term 'marine protected areas' but was not defined in simple A2 terms as required. The first sentence describes the term but does not define the word 'marine' itself.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the core concepts of 'reversing damage' and the 'unsolvable' nature of the future problem using only A2 vocabulary and structures. Eliminate all B1 structures immediately. Break the complex sentences into separate, simple A2 sentences. For example, rewrite 'Not protecting the sea will cause a big problem' to 'We must protect the sea. If we do not, there will be a big problem.' Define the keyword 'marine' as instructed.",
