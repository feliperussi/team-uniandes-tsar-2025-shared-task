    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5766 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe failure to preserve the core message and logical connections of the original text. The output is a disjointed list of facts, not a coherent argument.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8403 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'human activity' and 'environmental destruction' were lost in the oversimplification, failing to maintain lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses non-A2 vocabulary. 'damage' is a B1 word. 'means' is a B2 word. 'unsolvable' is advanced vocabulary. These are unacceptable deviations.\n- Defective Definition: The definition 'Marine means about the sea' uses the B2 word 'means'. All definitions must use A1/A2 vocabulary exclusively.\n- Structural Degradation: The text is excessively fragmented into short, choppy sentences. This degrades readability and obscures the causal links present in the original text, such as the idea that increasing protected areas is the solution to the damage.\n- Typographical Error: The text contains a typo ('big5 problem'), which is unacceptable.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text from scratch. Focus on maintaining the logical flow of the original. Replace all B1+ vocabulary. The word 'damage' must be rephrased using A2 terms like 'bad things' or 'problems'. The concept 'unsolvable' must be rephrased as 'a problem we cannot fix'. Combine overly short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'because' to restore the relationship between ideas.",
