The text fails to preserve the core message of the original.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of nuance. The original text states the hero prepares for their 'biggest challenge'. Your text reduces this to 'biggest problem'. A 'challenge' implies a test of ability and is a key concept in the hero's journey. A 'problem' is too general and loses this specific meaning.\n- The original text links the tests and the preparation directly: 'passing tests... as the hero prepares'. Your version breaks this link into two separate ideas: 'the hero has tests... These things help the hero prepare'. This weakens the causal relationship.\n- The simplification of 'mentor' to 'helper' and 'enemies' to 'bad people' is acceptable for A2, but contributes to the overall loss of specific meaning when combined with the other issues.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts. Rephrase 'biggest problem' to 'biggest test' or 'biggest fight'. Reconnect the preparatory stages to the final challenge. Example: 'To prepare for his biggest test, the hero fights bad people and meets new friends.'",
