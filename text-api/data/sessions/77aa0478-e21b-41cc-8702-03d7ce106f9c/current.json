    "text_translated": "When Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl, she saw a hula hoop for the first time. A hula hoop is a large plastic ring that you spin around your body. A child from another country was playing with one in her home country of Bangladesh. Wasfia wanted to play, but she only watched. This was because people in her country believed girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world who has climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is the first person to use a hula hoop on the top of each mountain. She did this to support women and girls in her country, where they are often told not to do sport.",

    "feedback": "This is a strong example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates the ability to write simple, connected text and explain reasons. The structure is excellent, using a good mix of simple and complex sentences connected with appropriate B1-level connectors like 'when', 'because', 'who', and 'where'. For example, the sentence 'She did this to support women and girls in her country, where they are often told not to do sport' correctly uses 'where' to add information. The vocabulary is well-controlled, and the paraphrasing of concepts like 'empower' to 'support' is effective for this level. All key information from the original text is included accurately.",
