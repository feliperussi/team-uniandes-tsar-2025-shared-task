The likely cause is the simplification of 'susceptible to fire' (an inherent quality of the material) to 'could catch fire' (a possibility of an event), which alters the semantic nuance. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check. The classifier result was 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'In the past, more bridges were made of wood, which meant they could catch fire much more easily' uses a relative clause referring to the entire preceding clause, a B2-level structure. To correct this, split the complex sentences into simpler ones. Suggestion: 'In the past, more bridges were made of wood. This meant they could catch fire more easily.' This change will improve readability and help meet the B1 target.",

The likely cause is the change from the original's neutral observation 'This was particularly true of' to the simplified text's 'This was a particular problem for'. This rephrasing alters the semantic focus from a factual example to a negative issue, which the model correctly identified as a meaning deviation. Additionally, the submission failed the CEFR compliance check. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is due to the final sentence being too long and structurally complex for a B1 level: 'This was a particular problem for old train bridges, where the small flashes of fire from the steel wheels on the steel tracks could sometimes cause the bridge to burn down completely.'
