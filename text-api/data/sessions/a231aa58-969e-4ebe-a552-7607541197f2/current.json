    "text_translated": "Researchers now have more questions about the influence of genetics (the study of genes and how traits pass from parents to children) on brain and language development, and one key question is whether a certain gene mutation (a change in a gene\u2019s DNA) gave us the ability to speak. They have found a gene mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to help our brains control our mouth and face when we speak. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation, which may explain why they cannot speak like us. Although it is still too early to say how much influence genetics has on language, one day we might find the answers hidden in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B2 rather than B1. One clear cause is the use of the verb \u2018undergo\u2019 in the sentence \u201cMonkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation,\u201d which is marked as B2 vocabulary. Additionally, the sentence structure is quite long and includes multiple parenthetical definitions, making it more complex than typical B1 texts. To correct this, replace \u2018undergo\u2019 with a simpler phrase such as \u2018go through\u2019 or \u2018experience mutation,\u2019 shorten or split long sentences into two, and reduce or simplify parenthetical explanations. This will help bring the text down to B1 level while preserving its meaning.",
