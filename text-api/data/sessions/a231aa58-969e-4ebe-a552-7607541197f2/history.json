For example, the first sentence uses a long parenthetical explanation: \u201cMore questions lie in the influence of genetics (the study of how traits are passed from parents to their children) on brain and language development.\u201d This structure and vocabulary such as \u201cinfluence of genetics\u201d and the embedded definition make the sentence too dense. To meet B1, split long sentences into two or three simple sentences, remove or shorten parenthetical clauses, and use simpler vocabulary. For instance, you could write: \"We have more questions about genetics. Genetics is how traits pass from parents to children. We want to know how genetics affects brain and language development.\" This will lower complexity and align the text with B1 requirements.",
