The BERTScore of 0.877 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's central theme is of an adventurer who is 'not content' and moves from 'challenge to challenge'. Your version, 'Some modern adventurers do many trips', completely erases this crucial concept of ambition and restlessness. This is a critical failure.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is low because you inserted new, external information not present in the source text. Sentences like 'The Sahara Desert is a very hot, dry place in Africa' and 'The South Pole is the bottom point of Earth' are definitions, not simplifications of the original narrative. This is an incorrect execution of the task.\n\n- Narrative Destruction: The original text emphasizes the South Pole journey as 'most remarkable'. Your version lists it neutrally ('She also went on a ski trip...'), destroying the author's intended focus and turning a story into a flat list of facts.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level words 'quit' and 'freezing' were used. These are not A2-compliant. They must be replaced with A2 equivalents.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Focus on preserving the original narrative's meaning. Do not add external facts. The introduction must convey the idea of seeking challenges. The South Pole trip must be presented as the most important one. Replace all non-A2 vocabulary immediately. 'Quit' must become 'stop'. 'Freezing' must become 'very cold'.",

Phrases like \"Not content with one amazing trip\" and \"Many of us would have given up\" were removed. This transforms a story about resilience into a simple, disconnected list of facts.\n- The replacement of key descriptive words with overly simple alternatives caused the fidelity failure. \"Remarkable journey\" became \"biggest trip,\" and \"freezing conditions\" became \"very cold weather.\" This strips the text of its meaning and impact.\n- The text was broken down into too many short, separate sentences. This fragmentation is the direct cause of the low meaning score, as it destroys the logical and narrative connections between events.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the core message.

The BERTScore of 0.8828 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text begins by establishing a general concept: 'Not content with one amazing trip, some of today's adventurers go from challenge to challenge.' Your output discards this framing and reduces the text to a simple list of facts about one person. This loses the central idea that Meagan is an example of a specific type of modern adventurer.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key concepts were oversimplified, damaging the meaning. The original's 'perhaps her most remarkable journey' was changed to 'Her biggest journey', losing the nuance of remarkability. The original's 'Many of us would have given up... but Meagan decided to carry on' highlights a conscious, strong decision. Your version, 'Many people would have stopped then but she kept going', is a weaker statement that loses the emphasis on her determination.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'satisfied' was used in the sentence 'She was not satisfied with one big trip.' This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\n- Structural Damage: While simplifying sentences is necessary for A2, your output breaks logical connections. The original states she 'pulled a sledge... through freezing conditions'. Your version separates this into two disconnected facts: 'She pulled a sled with a tent and food. She walked in very cold weather and ice storms.' The direct link between the action and the condition is lost.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by rephrasing the introduction to include the idea of adventurers who seek multiple challenges. Replace the B1 word 'satisfied' with an A2 phrase like 'happy with'. Reconnect sentences to maintain logical cause and effect, for example, by stating she pulled the sled in the cold weather.",

This metric confirms that the core message of Meagan's unique perseverance was lost.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8813 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'had to be rescued' and 'carry on' were oversimplified into 'People helped her' and 'she kept going', losing important lexical detail.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is a list of disconnected simple sentences. While aiming for A2, this approach has stripped the narrative flow and logical connections (e.g., cause and effect) present in the original.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. The sentence must reflect the hypothetical nature of the original text. A correct A2 version would be 'This is very difficult. Most people would stop, but she did not.' You must preserve facts above all else.",

The BERTScore of 0.87 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Core Message Lost: The original text is about an adventurer who seeks challenges and shows extreme perseverance. Your output is a simple list of facts that completely removes this central theme. The introductory idea that 'adventurers go from challenge to challenge' is missing.\n\n- Critical Nuance Destroyed: The original sentence 'Many of us would have given up at that point, but Meagan decided to carry on' conveys a powerful message of determination. Your version, 'Many people would stop, but she kept going,' is a sterile observation that loses all emotional and thematic weight. This is a primary contributor to the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Over-simplification: The text has been broken down into so many short, disconnected sentences that it no longer reads as a narrative. It is a list. This damages the story and the reader's understanding of the events as a connected journey.\n\n- Suggestion: Do not strip the text of its core message. The goal is simplification, not elimination. Reintroduce the concept that she is an adventurer who looks for challenges. You must rephrase the section about her fall to convey the idea of overcoming a great difficulty, not just stating a sequence of events. Use simple connectors like 'and' or 'but' to link sentences and restore a basic narrative flow.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.72 is below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.88 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.72): The original text emphasizes the extraordinary and challenging nature of the adventures ('amazing trip', 'remarkable journey', 'many of us would have given up'). Your version reduces the narrative to a simple list of facts, losing the sense of awe and determination. The phrase 'she kept going' does not capture the meaning of 'Meagan decided to carry on', which highlights a conscious, difficult choice.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.88): Key phrases from the original were replaced with overly simple equivalents, causing a loss of factual precision. For example, 'had to be rescued' was changed to 'A person rescued her', which is less precise. 'pulled a sledge... through freezing conditions' became 'walked in very cold weather', which changes the action and weakens the description of the environment.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text choppy and loses the narrative flow of the original.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write to restore the core meaning. Combine some sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'but'. Restore the concept that she made a difficult decision to continue after the accident. Use A2-level vocabulary that better reflects the meaning of 'remarkable' and 'freezing conditions'.",

The inclusion of a question mark (\"is?\") and the conversational filler \"Actually\" is incorrect. Definitions must be simple, declarative statements.\n\n- Corrective Actions: 1. Replace \"remarkable\" with an A2 phrase like \"most special\" or \"most amazing\". 2. Replace \"freezing weather\" with \"very cold weather\". 3.
