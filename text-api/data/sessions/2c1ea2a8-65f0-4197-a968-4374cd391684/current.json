    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on Priority 2 due to metrics falling below the required thresholds. The core message and lexical fidelity have been compromised.\n\n- MeaningBERT Score Failure: The score of 0.7285 is below the required 0.75. Your simplification into a list of disconnected facts lost the original text's narrative sense of continuous challenge and admiration. The original's tone is gone.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8789 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of deleting key phrases like \"Not content with one amazing trip\" and altering important constructions like \"had to be rescued\" into the less nuanced \"Rescuers saved her.\"\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 words \"remarkable\" and \"freezing\". This is an explicit violation of the A2 standard. These words must be replaced with A2-level vocabulary.\n\n- Defective Definition: The definition for \"South Pole\" is unacceptable. The inclusion of a question mark (\"is?\") and the conversational filler \"Actually\" is incorrect. Definitions must be simple, declarative statements.\n\n- Corrective Actions: 1. Replace \"remarkable\" with an A2 phrase like \"most special\" or \"most amazing\". 2. Replace \"freezing weather\" with \"very cold weather\". 3. Rewrite the definition for South Pole to be a direct statement, for example: \"The South Pole is the bottom point of the Earth.\" 4. Rephrase the rescue sentence to better capture the original meaning. Suggestion: \"She fell into a glacier and needed to be rescued.\"",
