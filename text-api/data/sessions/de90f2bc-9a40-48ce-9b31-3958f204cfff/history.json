A child from another country was visiting her home country, Bangladesh, and was playing with it. Wasfia just watched. In her country, people believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world who has climbed the Seven Summits. These are the highest mountains on each continent, like Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on the top of each mountain. She did this to encourage women and girls in her country, where they are often told not to do sports.",

        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to excessive sentence length. Multiple sentences exceed the B1 guideline of approximately 15 words. For example, 'A child from another country was visiting her home country, Bangladesh, and was playing with it' is 17 words. The final sentence, 'She did this to encourage women and girls in her country, where they are often told not to do sports,' is 20 words long and combines too many ideas. This structure is too complex for the B1 level and must be simplified into shorter sentences."
