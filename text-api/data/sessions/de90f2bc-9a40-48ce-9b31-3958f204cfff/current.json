    "text_translated": "When Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl, she saw a hula hoop for the first time. A child from another country was visiting her home country, Bangladesh. The child was playing with it. Wasfia just watched. In her country, people believed girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world to climb the Seven Summits. These are the highest mountains on each continent, like Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to hula-hoop on the top of each mountain. She did this to encourage women and girls in her country. There, they are often told not to do sports.",
