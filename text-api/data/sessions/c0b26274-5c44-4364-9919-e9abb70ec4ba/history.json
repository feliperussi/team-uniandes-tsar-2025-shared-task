While the text simplifies vocabulary, it fails to fully preserve the core psychological insight and the nuanced implications of the two mindsets as presented in the original text. The original emphasizes the profound difference in how children perceive and react to challenge and failure based on their mindset, and the specific psychological consequences (e.g., 'to boost their self-esteem'). Your version dilutes this depth, presenting the reactions without fully conveying the underlying psychological mechanism or the specific impact. For example, 'to boost their self-esteem' is simplified to 'This made them feel better', which loses the specific psychological concept. The initial definition of 'mindset' is an addition, not a simplification of the original text, which also contributes to the meaning divergence. Additionally, the word 'means' is classified as B2 vocabulary, which is a direct violation of the A2 standard. This word is used twice: 'This means they think they can learn and get better.' and 'This means they thought they could not change.' Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately convey the psychological depth and specific implications of the mindsets. Replace the B2 word 'means' with simpler A2 phrasing, such as 'This shows' or 'This is like'.",

Furthermore, the terms 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' are used directly without definition, despite 'growth' and 'fixed' being classified as B1 vocabulary.

The original text conveys a specific negative emotional and cognitive state: 'felt that their intelligence was being judged and they had failed'. Your version initially simplifies this to 'felt bad', which is too general and dilutes the specific meaning of being judged and failing, even though subsequent sentences elaborate. 3.

The core message and nuance of the original text have been significantly altered. The text also contains vocabulary that is not strictly A2. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text introduces Carol Dweck as a 'psychologist' and immediately describes her experiment and findings. Your version introduces her as a 'scientist' who 'studies the mind' and starts with a general definition of 'mindset'. This changes the primary focus from Dweck's specific psychological findings to a general concept, losing the original narrative's emphasis.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The term 'psychologist' is specific to the study of mind and behavior, directly relevant to the concept of 'mindsets'. Replacing it with the broader 'scientist' and 'studies the mind' loses this crucial professional context and specificity.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The phrase 'understood that their abilities could be developed' in the original conveys a deeper understanding of potential and growth. Your simplification 'knew they could learn and get better' is too simplistic and loses the nuance of 'abilities' and 'developed'.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original's 'unable to imagine improving' highlights a cognitive block. Your simplification 'could not change or get better' is a direct statement of inability, missing the 'imagination' aspect central to the fixed mindset's resistance to improvement.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'means' is classified as B2. For A2, simpler phrasing like 'This is when...' or 'This shows...' should be used.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Reintroduce Carol Dweck as a 'psychologist' to maintain professional context. \n- Start the text by describing Dweck's experiment and findings, introducing 'mindset' as a concept she identified, rather than beginning with a general definition. \n- Rephrase 'knew they could learn and get better' to better reflect the concept of 'abilities being developed'. \n- Rephrase 'could not change or get better' to include the idea of 'imagining' improvement. \n- Replace 'means' with an A2 appropriate phrase.",

Your version introduces explicit definitions like 'A 'mindset' is a way of thinking.

This indicates the language is too complex for the A2 standard.\n*   Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'psychologist' (B2) is above the A2 level. The words 'growth' (B1) and 'fixed' (B1) are also above the A2 level. These terms must be replaced with simpler A2 vocabulary or rephrased entirely.\n*   Structural Complexity: The use of 'This is when...' to define concepts (e.g., 'This is when they believed their skills could get better.') is a B1 structure. Embedded clauses such as 'what they can do later' and 'how smart they were' are B1 structures. The relative clause 'who did worse' is also a B1 structure. A2 requires simpler sentence constructions and limited use of complex clauses.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the explicit definitions of 'mindset'. Rephrase the descriptions of 'growth' and 'fixed' mindsets using only A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures, focusing on what the children *did* or *said* directly, as in the original.

While the text is factually correct, it loses some of the original's nuanced meaning through oversimplification and omission. Specific issues include: The original text introduces Carol Dweck as a 'psychologist' and mentions 'early in her career', which provides important context. Your version omits this. The phrase 'loved challenge' from the original is simplified to 'loved hard problems', which loses the broader concept of 'challenge'. The original's 'understood that their abilities could be developed' is simplified to 'knew they could make their skills better', which is less precise. The original's 'focused on what they can achieve in the future' is simplified to 'thought about new things they can do', which loses the sense of active focus and goal-orientation. These cumulative changes dilute the depth of the original message, leading to the low MeaningBERT score. Suggestion: Reintroduce the professional context of Carol Dweck. Rephrase to capture the broader meaning of 'challenge' and 'abilities developed' more accurately, while maintaining A2 vocabulary. Ensure the concept of 'future focus' is clearly conveyed.",

The classifier result of A2 is misleading due to the presence of these higher-level words. Specific deviations include: The word 'psychologist' (B2) is used directly in 'Carol Dweck is a psychologist.'. This word is above A2. The word 'means' (B2) is used directly in 'This means they believed they could always learn.' and 'This means they believed they could not get better.'. This word is above A2. The word 'growth' (B1) is used directly in 'growth mindset'. This word is above A2. The word 'fixed' (B1) is used directly in 'fixed mindset'. This word is above A2. While 'mindset' was a keyword for definition, the components 'growth' and 'fixed' themselves are B1 and should have been simplified or avoided. The rule is clear: any unapproved B1/B2 word is a failure. Suggestion: Replace 'psychologist' with a simpler phrase like 'a person who studies the mind'. Replace 'means' with 'This shows' or 'This is like'. Rephrase 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' to avoid the B1 words 'growth' and 'fixed' directly, perhaps by saying 'a way of thinking about learning that helps you get better' or 'a way of thinking about learning that stops you from getting better'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original, as evidenced by the low metric scores.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6841 is below the required 0.75. The core concepts of 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' were not adequately preserved. While 'mindset' was defined, the specific psychological implications of 'growth' and 'fixed' were diluted by replacing them with generic phrases like 'way of thinking that helps them get better' and 'way of thinking that stops them from getting better'. This loses the specific, established terminology and the deeper psychological nuance of the original text.\n2.  Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.892 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. For example, 'psychologist' was replaced with 'person who studies the mind', 'challenge' with 'hard things', 'abilities could be developed' with 'could learn and get better', 'intelligence was being judged' with 'people judged if they were smart', and 'self-esteem' with 'feel good about themselves'. The complete replacement of 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' with descriptive phrases also contributed to this lexical loss.\n\nSuggestion: The core terms 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' must be introduced and then explained in A2 terms, rather than being completely replaced. Ensure that the simplified vocabulary still captures the essence of the original terms and their specific implications. Rephrase to maximize lexical and semantic overlap with the original while adhering to A2 vocabulary.",

While the factual information is present, the original text's nuance regarding the children's active reactions to the difficult problems and the deeper implication of those reactions for their mindset is diluted.

The core message about the unveiling of mindsets through these specific reactions is not fully preserved. \n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This indicates the language used is too complex for the target level.\n- Vocabulary Audit Failure: Several B1/B2 words are present without being adequately replaced by A2 equivalents. Simply defining a complex word does not make the text A2 compliant if the word itself is still used. Examples include 'intelligence' (B1) and 'cheat' (B1), which are used directly without definition or replacement. 'Psychologist' (B2), 'mindset' (B1), 'challenge' (B1), and 'self-esteem' (B2) are defined but still present, which is not sufficient for A2 compliance. The goal is to use A2 vocabulary, not just explain B1/B2 terms.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'This means they believe they can always learn and get better' uses a 'that-clause' structure, which is typically B1. Similarly, 'They think about what they can do in the future' contains a noun clause ('what they can do'), also a B1 structure. The phrase 'could not imagine learning more' uses 'imagine + -ing', which is a B1 grammatical structure. These structures elevate the text beyond A2 simplicity.",
