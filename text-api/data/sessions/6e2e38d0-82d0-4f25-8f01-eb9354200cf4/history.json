While the text is factually accurate and maintains good lexical fidelity (BERTScore 0.9388), the simplification strategy sometimes diluted the original's emphasis. For example, 'most lucrative product' was simplified to 'most popular product'. While 'popular' is simpler, 'lucrative' conveys a stronger economic impact, which is central to the 'death' of the product and the crisis faced by the growers. Similarly, 'dominated the plantations' was simplified to 'was very popular on the farms'. 'Dominated' implies a level of control and widespread presence that 'very popular' might not fully capture in terms of agricultural and market dominance. To improve, consider retaining stronger semantic equivalents for key concepts that convey the economic or dominant nature of the original text, even if it means slightly more complex vocabulary, as long as it remains within the B1 CEFR level. For instance, 'most profitable product' could be used instead of 'most popular product' to better convey the economic aspect.",

These changes significantly enhance readability for a B1 audience. The use of B1 connectors such as 'because' and relative clauses ('which was also known as', 'which is the banana that came after') is appropriate. For further improvement, consider breaking down some of the longer sentences, particularly the first sentence, into two shorter ones to reduce cognitive load, even though the current structure is technically within B1 guidelines. For example, 'In the 1950s, companies that grew and sold bananas in Central America were facing a big problem.

Complex sentence structures from the original, such as participial phrases ('With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit') and colons, were effectively broken down into clearer, more accessible clauses using B1-level connectors like 'because' and 'which'. For example, 'mass-produced' was successfully simplified to 'produced a very large number', 'lucrative' to 'profitable', and 'successor' to 'banana that came after Big Mike'. The explanation of the cloning process was also made more explicit and easier to follow. The flow of the text is natural and coherent. To further refine, continue to ensure that even when simplifying, the full nuance of the original is captured, especially when MeaningBERT scores are at the lower end of the acceptable range. Overall, this is a very strong submission.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification while maintaining factual integrity and meaning. The factual integrity check confirmed no discrepancies between the original and simplified text. Both MeaningBERT (0.7536) and BERTScore (0.9428) are above their respective thresholds, indicating strong preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, which is the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. Complex sentence structures, such as the adjectival phrases in 'easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit,' were effectively rephrased into more accessible B1 structures like 'fruit was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet.' The long, complex sentence in the original using a colon to introduce an explanation was skillfully split into two distinct sentences in the output, significantly improving readability for a B1 audience. Vocabulary choices generally align with B1 expectations. While 'lucrative' (C1) was replaced with 'profitable' (also listed as C1), the overall text structure and other vocabulary choices successfully bring the text to a B1 level. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
