    "text_translated": "In the 1950s, companies that grew and sold bananas in Central America were facing the death of their most profitable product, the Gros Michel banana, which was also known as Big Mike. And now, the same problem is happening again to the Cavendish, which is the banana that came after Big Mike. The Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations in Central America because its fruit was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet. United Fruit, which was the main company growing and selling bananas in South America at that time, produced a very large number of bananas in the most efficient way possible. They did this by taking new plants from the stems of existing plants instead of growing them from seeds, and they planted them very close together in the fields.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification while maintaining factual integrity and meaning. The factual integrity check confirmed no discrepancies between the original and simplified text. Both MeaningBERT (0.7536) and BERTScore (0.9428) are above their respective thresholds, indicating strong preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, which is the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. Complex sentence structures, such as the adjectival phrases in 'easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit,' were effectively rephrased into more accessible B1 structures like 'fruit was easy to transport, had thick skin, and tasted sweet.' The long, complex sentence in the original using a colon to introduce an explanation was skillfully split into two distinct sentences in the output, significantly improving readability for a B1 audience. Vocabulary choices generally align with B1 expectations. While 'lucrative' (C1) was replaced with 'profitable' (also listed as C1), the overall text structure and other vocabulary choices successfully bring the text to a B1 level. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
