The text was oversimplified to the point of significant meaning loss. The BERTScore of 0.893 also fails to meet the minimum 0.90 fidelity requirement.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The core message was damaged by excessive simplification. The concept of 'anti-venom' was reduced to 'special medicine', and 'fatalities' became 'people do not die'. This loses critical information and nuance.\n\n- Lexical Inaccuracy: The specific meaning of 'urticating hairs' that 'embed themselves' was lost. Your version, 'special hairs' that 'get into your skin', fails to convey the intended concepts of irritation and physical embedding.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore confirms that too many key terms from the original text were removed or replaced, damaging the factual integrity of the summary.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'bite' and 'shoot'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the lost meaning using A2-compliant language. Do not remove concepts; explain them simply. For 'anti-venom', use 'a medicine that stops the poison'. For 'fatalities', use 'no one has died from its bite'. For 'urticating hairs', explain the effect: 'They push out hairs that make your skin and eyes red and sore'. Replace 'bite' with 'when a spider hurts you'. Replace 'shoot out' with 'send out'.",
