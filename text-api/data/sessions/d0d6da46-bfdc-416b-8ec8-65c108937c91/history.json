        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to the inclusion of the C1-level word 'diplomat'. The rules are absolute: the text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary. Explaining a complex word is not a valid substitute for using a simpler one, and it violates the core principle of communicating with vocabulary the learner already possesses. This is a critical failure. While the sentence structure and other vocabulary choices are appropriate for A2, this single violation makes the entire output unacceptable."
