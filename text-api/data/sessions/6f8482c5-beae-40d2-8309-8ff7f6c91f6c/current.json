    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5264 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the 'mysteries' of bridge collapses and the necessity of a 'complete investigation' is lost in the simplification. The original text conveys a sense of complex problem-solving, which is diluted to 'People do not know why. Engineers must study it.' This simplification removes the nuance and specific framing of the original meaning. The term 'collapses' is also replaced by the less precise 'falls down'. The overall meaning is too generalized and lacks the specific emphasis of the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the concept of 'mysteries' and the thoroughness of the 'investigation' while using A2 vocabulary. For example, 'Sometimes, a bridge breaks. No one knows why it breaks. Engineers need to look at it very carefully to find the reason.'",
