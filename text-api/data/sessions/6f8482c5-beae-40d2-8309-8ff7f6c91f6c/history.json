Specific deviations include: The original's 'inferior-quality material' was simplified to 'things used to build the bridge were not good', losing the specific concept of 'quality'. 'Defect in a key piece' became 'an important part had a problem', which is less precise than 'defect'. 'Designed only to support a certain amount of weight' was reduced to 'made for a special weight. It could not hold more', losing the nuance of 'designed' and 'certain amount'. The original implies a more formal investigative process ('conduct a complete investigation', 'realise why'), which is flattened to 'study them well' and 'find out why'. This overall simplification, while aiming for A2, has stripped too much of the original's semantic richness. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's precision and the formal nature of the investigation, while still using A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, 'bad materials' instead of 'things used to build the bridge were not good' to keep the idea of 'quality'.",

This loses the specific nuance of material quality standards. The original 'defect in a key piece of the bridge' was simplified to 'an important part was broken'. This loses the specific technical term 'defect' which implies a flaw, not just a general breakage. The original 'the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight' was simplified to 'the bridge was made for a certain weight. It could not carry more'. This loses the engineering concept of 'design' and its implications for structural limits.

Your output fails to accurately convey the core meaning of the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score: The score of 0.5702 indicates a substantial loss or distortion of the original message. The original text emphasizes that the *reasons* for bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers *only* discover these reasons *after* a complete investigation. Your version, 'When a bridge falls down, it is often a mystery. Engineers must study it carefully. Then they find the reason,' subtly shifts the meaning. It implies the *event* of the bridge falling is a mystery, and it loses the crucial nuance of 'only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation,' which highlights the difficulty and necessity of a thorough investigation.\n- CEFR Compliance: Although not the primary failure, the classifier rated your text as B1. This indicates it is still too complex for an A2 target. For example, the word 'mystery' is classified as B1, and while you used it, the overall sentence structure and vocabulary choices did not sufficiently simplify the text to A2 level.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the opening to clearly state that the *cause* of the collapse is the mystery, not the collapse itself. For example, 'It is often hard to know why a bridge falls down.'\n- Emphasize the necessity and thoroughness of the investigation. Instead of 'Engineers must study it carefully,' consider 'Engineers need to look very closely for a long time to find out why.'\n- Replace B1 vocabulary like 'mystery' with simpler A2 alternatives. For example, 'It is often hard to know why' instead of 'it is often a mystery.'",
