    "text_translated": "The album\u202fBorn in the USA is a fast\u2011paced, foot\u2011tapping rock record, and its songs carry emotional weight. Behind the catchy rock tunes, the lyrics tell the dark side of the American dream, the idea that anyone can become successful through hard work. Many tracks deal with ordinary people who work hard but feel bitterness and anger because life does not give them riches or fame. The song\u202fGlory Days, for example, is about people in a small town who look back at the time when they were young and felt the world was theirs.\u202fDownbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined after he loses his job. It is easy to imagine that the artist is showing real people he knew and the life he might have had if he had not become a star. The album shows the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss. The Boss is the main leader of his band and a famous musician.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.862) and BERTScore (0.9375) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of keywords was a key strength; the definitions for 'American dream' ('the idea that anyone can become successful through hard work') and 'the Boss' ('the main leader of his band and a famous musician') were clear and seamlessly integrated. Furthermore, vocabulary strategy was excellent, successfully replacing the C1-level word 'glory' with 'fame' and simplifying complex phrases like 'had the world at their feet' to the more accessible 'felt the world was theirs'. The final text is fluent, accurate, and perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
