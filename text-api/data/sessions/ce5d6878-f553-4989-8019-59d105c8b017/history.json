Behind the catchy rock tunes, the lyrics tell the dark side of the American dream, which is the idea that anyone can become successful through hard work. Many tracks deal with ordinary people who work hard but feel bitterness and anger because life does not give them riches or fame. The song Great Days, for example, is about people in a small town who look back at the time when they were young and felt the world was theirs. Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined after he loses his job. It is easy to imagine that the artist is showing real people he knew and the life he might have had if he had not become a star. The album leaves no doubt about the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss, which means the main leader of his band, who is a famous musician.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The original text states the song title is 'Glory Days', but the output incorrectly changes this to 'Great Days'. Changing the proper name of a work of art is a critical factual error that instantly fails the evaluation. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the final sentence's complex structure, which combines the main point with two dependent clauses to define 'the Boss'. Suggestion: To correct this, place the definition in a separate sentence, such as: 'The album shows the unique talent of the Boss. The Boss is the main leader of his band and a famous musician.'",

        "feedback_text": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.862) and BERTScore (0.9375) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of keywords was a key strength; the definitions for 'American dream' ('the idea that anyone can become successful through hard work') and 'the Boss' ('the main leader of his band and a famous musician') were clear and seamlessly integrated. Furthermore, vocabulary strategy was excellent, successfully replacing the C1-level word 'glory' with 'fame' and simplifying complex phrases like 'had the world at their feet' to the more accessible 'felt the world was theirs'. The final text is fluent, accurate, and perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
