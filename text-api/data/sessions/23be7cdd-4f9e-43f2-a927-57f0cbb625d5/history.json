        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6699 is significantly below the required 0.75. While the factual information is largely present, the nuanced meaning, intensity, and the original's narrative tone have been lost through oversimplification. The text fails to convey the full essence of the original message.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation: The original text conveys a strong sense of personal control and positive experience with phrases like 'This is great because I am in control'. Your version simplifies this to 'This is good. I can decide what I do. I can decide my work time.', which loses the intensity of 'great' and the agency implied by 'in control'.\n2.  Meaning Preservation: The original phrase 'I found it really hard to concentrate' loses its intensity when simplified to 'But it was hard to think about work'. The word 'really' and the specific cognitive function of 'concentrate' are diminished.\n3.  Meaning Preservation: The nuance of 'Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal' is lost when simplified to 'the internet was not good'. 'Ideal' suggests a higher standard than simply 'good'.\n4.  Meaning Preservation: The original 'being able to focus in an office environment' is simplified to 'I could think only about work there. It was a good place to work.' This loses the specific concept of 'focus' and the professional context of an 'office environment'.\n5.  Structural Simplification: While A2 requires simple sentences, breaking down causal relationships (e.g., 'This is great because...') into separate, declarative sentences can sometimes dilute the logical flow and meaning, contributing to the lower MeaningBERT score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain more of the original's intensity and specific meaning, even with simpler vocabulary. For example, instead of 'This is good', consider 'This makes me very happy' or 'This is a very good thing'. Ensure that the emotional tone and the specific benefits described in the original are not completely flattened.",

The text successfully maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning (MeaningBERT 0.7816) and lexical fidelity (BERTScore 0.9093), and is accurately classified as A2 CEFR compliant. The vocabulary is strictly A2 or below, and sentence structures are simple and direct. The inclusion of clear, A2-level definitions for 'freelancer' and 'co-working space' enhances readability for the target audience without deviating from the original narrative. Minor semantic shifts, such as 'housework that needed doing' becoming 'I saw cleaning the house' and 'another cup of tea' becoming 'I wanted more tea', are acceptable simplifications for the A2 level as they do not compromise the overall meaning of distractions.",
