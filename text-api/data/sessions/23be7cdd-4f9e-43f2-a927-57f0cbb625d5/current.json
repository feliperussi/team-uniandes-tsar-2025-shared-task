    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed. The text successfully maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning (MeaningBERT 0.7816) and lexical fidelity (BERTScore 0.9093), and is accurately classified as A2 CEFR compliant. The vocabulary is strictly A2 or below, and sentence structures are simple and direct. The inclusion of clear, A2-level definitions for 'freelancer' and 'co-working space' enhances readability for the target audience without deviating from the original narrative. Minor semantic shifts, such as 'housework that needed doing' becoming 'I saw cleaning the house' and 'another cup of tea' becoming 'I wanted more tea', are acceptable simplifications for the A2 level as they do not compromise the overall meaning of distractions.",
