    "feedback": "This is a strong B1 submission. The writer successfully combines ideas into well-structured sentences using appropriate connectors, such as 'but' to create a compound sentence and 'because' to provide a reason. For example, '...but luckily this kind of damage is not very common' and '...because engineers have learned to build them...'. The vocabulary is perfectly aligned with the B1 level, and the paraphrasing of 'infrequent' to 'not very common' demonstrates good communicative competence. The text is coherent and factually accurate.",
