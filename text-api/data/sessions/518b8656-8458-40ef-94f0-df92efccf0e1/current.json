    "text_translated": "**Asteroids** are large rocks in space. They are called 'hazardous' if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. NASA has created a map of 1,400 of these objects. However, none of them are expected to be a danger in the next one hundred years. With available technology, NASA can track these asteroids and predict a possible impact. If this happens, two different ways to protect Earth could be launched.",

It is direct, cites specific evidence for the failure ('`CEFR_Classifier_Result` is 'B2', which does not match the `Target_CEFR_Level` of 'B1''), and clearly explains the consequence according to the protocol. The 'FAIL' status and grade of 1 are perfectly justified by this clear explanation.",
