The original specifies that we forget the times we dream about specific events that do not happen, not that we forget all dreams.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8941 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of the factual error. Your version loses the critical link between dreaming of an event and that event not happening, which damages the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'coincidence' was used directly. This word is too advanced for the A2 level and must be simplified. An A2 text cannot contain unsimplified B2 vocabulary.\n\n- Meaning Distortion: The final sentence, 'We forget such events when they do not happen,' is ambiguous. It implies we forget the real-world events, not the dreams about them, which alters the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to correct the factual error and simplify the vocabulary. Rephrase the final sentences to state: 'We often forget our dreams about these things when they do not happen.' Replace 'the result of coincidence' with an A2-compliant phrase like 'it just happens by chance'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.616 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.876 is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text establishes a direct contrast between 'coincidence' and 'prophecy'. Your version, 'These dreams just happen. They are not a message about the future,' fails to capture the specific concept of coincidence (things happening by chance). This is a critical loss of the core message.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key vocabulary from the original text. Words like 'coincidence', 'prophecy', 'result', and 'likely' were eliminated, which degraded the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Nuance Loss: The original states we 'probably choose to forget' dreams. Your version, 'We often forget', changes the meaning from a potential choice to a simple frequency.\n\n- Suggestion: You must reintroduce the core contrast. Rephrase to explain that dreams happen by chance, not as messages. Example: 'These dreams happen by chance. They are not messages about the future.'\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the lost nuance. Rephrase to include the idea of choice. Example: 'We often choose to forget the dreams that do not happen.'",
