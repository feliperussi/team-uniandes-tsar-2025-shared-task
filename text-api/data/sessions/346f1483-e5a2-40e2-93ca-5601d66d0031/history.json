It was used in the sentence 'Some news makes us think the world is a very violent place.' This word is not on the A2 list and must be simplified.\n- B2 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'terrorism' is B2 level. It was used in the sentence 'However, there is more terrorism in the last few years.' This is a complex concept and its vocabulary is far outside the A2 standard. It should have been simplified or defined as a keyword.\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The 'Keywords for Definition' list was empty. A complex but central term like 'terrorism' must be identified and defined in simple A2 terms if it is to be used. This was not done.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'violent' with a simple A2 description, such as 'a bad place with a lot of fighting'. Replace the B2 word 'terrorism' with an A2-level explanation, such as 'attacks on normal people to make them afraid'.",
