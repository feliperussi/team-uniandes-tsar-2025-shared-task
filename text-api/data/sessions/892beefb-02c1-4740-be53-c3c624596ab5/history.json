This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text's central concept is about 'speeding up evolution' and 'augmenting' human bodies. Your output, 'add things to our bodies to make us better', is too generic and loses this specific, crucial meaning.\n- Secondary Deviation: The BERTScore of 0.8982 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key lexical items like 'evolution', 'augmenting', and 'perception' with overly simple phrases, causing a loss of fidelity to the source.\n- Consequence: While the output is grammatically simple and uses A2 vocabulary, it fails its primary purpose of accurately representing the original text's meaning in simpler terms.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Find A2-level ways to express the idea of 'making humans develop faster' or 'improving humans in a big way'. The current version is a poor summary, not an accurate simplification.",

This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: The simplification process was too aggressive, creating excessive distance from the original vocabulary. Key B1/B2 concepts like 'evolution', 'augmenting', 'enhance', and 'commonplace' were replaced with A2 words ('develop', 'adding', 'make better', 'normal'). While this correctly targets the A2 level, the cumulative effect lowered the fidelity score below the minimum standard. The text is factually correct and preserves the general meaning, but it does not retain enough of the original's specific phrasing.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to improve lexical fidelity. The goal is to find phrasing that is closer to the original's meaning without using B1 vocabulary. A minor adjustment to one or two key phrases is required to meet the 0.90 BERTScore standard.",
