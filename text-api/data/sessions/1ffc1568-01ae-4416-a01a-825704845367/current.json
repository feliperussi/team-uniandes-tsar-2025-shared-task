    "text_translated": "In a global survey carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 people gave their answers about work. The survey included **millennials**. Millennials are people born between 1983 and 1993. It also included people from other age groups. The questions were about subjects such as work culture, communication, and working styles. They also asked about how people are paid, career development, and the balance between work and personal life. In a separate global survey by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials took part in a study. The study asked for their opinions about the good and bad things in the complicated world of work.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary B1 simplification that passes all checks. Factual Integrity: All numbers, names, and key facts from the original text are perfectly preserved. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7524 and BERTScore of 0.9341 are both above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were successfully retained. CEFR Compliance: The output correctly achieved the target B1 classification. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy is excellent. The writer effectively broke down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones, which greatly improves readability. The handling of the keyword 'millennial' is a model of good practice; it was correctly identified and defined clearly in a separate sentence. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'threats and opportunities' to 'the good and bad things' and 'work-life balance' to 'the balance between work and personal life', are perfectly suited for the B1 level. No improvements are necessary.",
