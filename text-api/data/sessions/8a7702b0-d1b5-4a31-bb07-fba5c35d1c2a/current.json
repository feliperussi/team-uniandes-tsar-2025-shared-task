    "text_translated": "George Lucas was one of the first movie makers who based his story on the 17 steps of the hero\u2019s journey. The hero\u2019s journey is a story pattern where a main character leaves a normal life, faces challenges, and returns changed. Usually the hero starts the story living an ordinary life, but something happens that calls them to an adventure that changes everything. At the beginning of *Star Wars*, Luke lives an ordinary life with his aunt and uncle, fixing robots. When he finds Princess\u202fLeia\u2019s message to Obi\u2011Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2\u2011D2, that message becomes the call to adventure that starts the hero\u2019s journey.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all evaluation checks. Factual integrity is maintained throughout the text. The MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. A key strength of this submission is the excellent handling of the keyword 'hero's journey'. The writer correctly identified it and added a clear, concise definition that significantly improves comprehension for the target audience. Vocabulary substitutions, such as 'repairing' to 'fixing' and 'early film directors' to 'first movie makers', are appropriate and effective. The overall text is clear, well-structured, and an excellent example of B1 simplification.",
