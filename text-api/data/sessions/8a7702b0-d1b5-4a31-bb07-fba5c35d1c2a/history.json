        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. This is because the output combines multiple ideas into overly long and complex sentences. For example, the first sentence 'George Lucas was one of the first movie makers who based his story on the 17 steps of the hero\u2019s journey, which is a pattern where a main character leaves a normal life, faces challenges, and returns changed' uses multiple relative clauses. Suggestion: Split the definition into a new sentence, such as 'The hero's journey is a story pattern...'. Similarly, the final sentence combines two separate ideas from the original text. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences to meet the B1 target.",

The MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. A key strength of this submission is the excellent handling of the keyword 'hero's journey'. The writer correctly identified it and added a clear, concise definition that significantly improves comprehension for the target audience. Vocabulary substitutions, such as 'repairing' to 'fixing' and 'early film directors' to 'first movie makers', are appropriate and effective. The overall text is clear, well-structured, and an excellent example of B1 simplification.",
