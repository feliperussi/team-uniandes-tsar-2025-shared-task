    "text_translated": "Many artists sell a lot of albums, but Bruce Springsteen is different. He is almost 70 years old, and he still makes new music. His new songs often go to number one. He plays in very big stadiums, and they are always full. He is still one of the best musicians. This does not surprise me. He tells stories about the most important things in our lives. When you listen to his album 'Born in the USA', you can understand this. Those stories are still true for people's lives today, just like in the past.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The output is a model of A2 simplification and meets all requirements of the protocol.\n\n*   **Factual Integrity:** The text is factually correct. The simplification of 'late 60s' to 'almost 70 years old' is accurate and appropriate for the level.\n*   **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.82 is exceptionally high, indicating that the core message of the original text was preserved with precision.\n*   **CEFR Compliance:** The classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms this.\n*   **Vocabulary Audit:** The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. There are no violations.\n*   **Structural Analysis:** The text exclusively uses short, simple sentences connected by basic A2 conjunctions ('and', 'but'). The breakdown of concepts like 'chart-topping' into 'His new songs often go to number one' is exemplary. The text is a perfect execution of the A2 standard.",
