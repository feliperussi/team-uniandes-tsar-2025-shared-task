To everyone's surprise, Pi declares that he is a Hindu, a Muslim and a Christian simultaneously. When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses, saying 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, they decide to let him make his own mind up about religion.",

    "feedback": "The output is approved as it successfully passes all critical checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR B1 compliance. The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.99) are excellent, indicating high fidelity to the original source. The simplification is effective in its structural adjustments, such as replacing 'his family and teachers' with the pronoun 'they' for better flow. However, the simplification is incomplete. The C1-level word 'simultaneously' was identified as a candidate for replacement but was left unchanged in the final text. For a B1 audience, this word should have been replaced with a simpler phrase like 'at the same time'. This oversight is the primary reason the grade is not higher. To improve, ensure all vocabulary candidates above the target CEFR level are simplified.",
