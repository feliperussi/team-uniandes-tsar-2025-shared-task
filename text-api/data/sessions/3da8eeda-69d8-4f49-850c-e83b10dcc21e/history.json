This failure occurred despite passing the critical Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks. The A2 classification is likely due to over-simplification of sentence structure. The original text used a complex sentence: 'Though his family is Hindu, he is curious about other religions and he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker.' The output split this into two simpler sentences, which reduced the overall grammatical complexity. To reach the B1 target, consider re-combining these sentences to retain a more advanced structure. For example: 'Although his family is Hindu, Pi is curious about other religions, so he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker.'

While the simplification successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, with excellent MeaningBERT (0.91) and BERTScore (0.97) metrics, its linguistic profile is too simple. This is likely due to the overuse of the A1/A2 connector 'so' and the creation of a run-on sentence at the end. Suggestion for improvement: Revise the final sentence by splitting it into two. For example: 'When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses and explains 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, they decide to let him make his own mind up about religion.' This revision removes the simple connector and improves the sentence structure to better align with B1 standards.",

Although the output is factually perfect and preserves the original meaning with very high fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.94, BERTScore 0.98), it fails on the core requirement of meeting the target complexity. The over-simplification is evident in the reduction of vocabulary and sentence structure. For example, replacing the B2-level adverb 'simultaneously' with the A1-level phrase 'all at the same time' significantly lowers the text's lexical complexity. To correct this, the text needs to be revised to incorporate slightly more complex grammar or vocabulary characteristic of the B1 level, without sacrificing clarity.",

The simplification is effective in its structural adjustments, such as replacing 'his family and teachers' with the pronoun 'they' for better flow. However, the simplification is incomplete. The C1-level word 'simultaneously' was identified as a candidate for replacement but was left unchanged in the final text. For a B1 audience, this word should have been replaced with a simpler phrase like 'at the same time'. This oversight is the primary reason the grade is not higher.
