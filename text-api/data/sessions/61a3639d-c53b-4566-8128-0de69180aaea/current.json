I can take time off easily. My children need me for school shows. I can take time off for them. I can also see the dentist.\n\nBut there is a bad thing. I do not have set work times.

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards while preserving factual integrity and core meaning. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7551 and BERTScore of 0.9034 confirm excellent fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2, with appropriate simplifications for terms like 'global IT company' to 'IT company in many countries' and 'project basis' to 'specific jobs. These jobs have a start and an end.' Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate words such as 'So', 'and', 'But', and 'because'. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
