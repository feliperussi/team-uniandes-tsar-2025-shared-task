        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6324 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Loss (idle chit-chat): The original phrase 'making idle chit-chat with colleagues' conveys the benefit of avoiding unproductive social interaction. Your simplification 'I do not talk much with other workers' is a factual statement but loses the positive connotation of avoiding *unnecessary* talk, thus altering the intended meaning.\n*   Meaning Loss (project basis): The original 'I work on a project basis' describes a specific work structure that enables flexibility. Your version 'I work on different jobs' is less precise and loses the specific nature of the work arrangement.\n*   Meaning Loss (valuable vs. good): The original 'this flexibility is very valuable to me' emphasizes the high importance of this benefit. Your phrase 'This is good for me' uses a weaker adjective, diminishing the emphasis on the value of flexibility.\n*   Weakened Causal Links: The original text uses explicit connectors like 'That means that' and 'because' to clearly establish cause-and-effect relationships. Your version often breaks these into separate, simpler sentences, which can dilute the explicit connections and overall coherence of the message. For example, the link between 'without clear office hours' and 'tend to work well into the evening' is less strongly conveyed as a direct consequence or tendency in your simplified version.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the text to ensure that the specific nuances and causal relationships from the original are preserved, even when simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure. Focus on conveying the *reason* behind statements, not just the facts.",

While the automated metrics for meaning and fidelity passed, the qualitative audit identified critical deviations from the A2 vocabulary and structural requirements. \n- The word 'unimportant' is classified as B1. This is evident in the sentence: 'I do not talk about unimportant things with other workers.' \n- The word 'fixed' is classified as B1. This is evident in the sentence: 'I do not have fixed work times.' \n- The word 'means' is classified as B2. This is evident in the sentences: 'This means I do not travel to work.' and 'This means I can take time off easily.' \n- The connector 'Or' was used in the sentence 'Or I need to see the dentist.' A2 connectors are strictly limited to 'and', 'but', 'so', 'because' as per the protocol. \nSuggestion: Replace 'unimportant' with simpler A2 phrases such as 'not important' or 'small talk'. Replace 'fixed' with 'set' or 'regular'. Rephrase sentences using 'means' to avoid this B2 word; consider using 'This makes it possible for me to...' or 'This helps me...'. Avoid 'Or' and rephrase sentences to use allowed connectors or separate sentences to maintain A2 simplicity.",

The text fails to fully preserve the nuanced meaning of the original. Specific deviations include: - The term 'global IT company' was reduced to 'big IT company', losing the essential concept of international reach. - 'Project basis' was rendered as 'separate tasks', failing to capture the structured and often deadline-driven nature of project work. - The concept of 'flexibility' was narrowed to 'choose my work time', which is only one aspect of flexibility and not its full meaning. These changes result in a loss of fidelity to the original text's meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase to ensure that simplified terms still convey the full, original meaning. For 'global', use 'company in many countries'. For 'project basis', use 'work on specific jobs with a start and end'. For 'flexibility', use 'can change my work schedule easily'.",
