        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The output contains two significant factual errors. First, the original text's 'mass they have' was changed to 'mass they carry'. This incorrectly implies the danger comes from cargo rather than the total weight of the vessel. Second, the original phrase 'these terrible accidents' was changed to 'these A2 accidents', which is nonsensical and breaks the meaning of the sentence. This is a critical failure. Additionally, the submission fails on CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', not the required 'B1'. This is because difficult vocabulary from the original, such as 'collapse', 'mass', and 'structural', were kept without simplification, and the sentence 'With trains... they move slowly' is too complex for a B1 level. To fix this, correct the factual errors and simplify the B2/C1 vocabulary as instructed. For example, change 'collapse' to 'fall down' and 'mass' to 'weight'. Also, split the long sentence into two shorter ones to meet the B1 structural requirements.",

The high MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.96) scores are well-deserved, reflecting a successful preservation of the original message and key details. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies used are exemplary: the complex sentence about boats was effectively split into two shorter sentences, improving readability. Vocabulary choices were strong, with complex terms like 'velocity' and 'collapse' being simplified to 'speed' and 'fall down' respectively, which is ideal for the target audience. The paraphrasing of 'structural weakness' to 'weakness in the structure' is another effective technique that enhances clarity. Overall, this is a high-quality submission.",
