    "text_translated": "Both types of accidents are very rare, but boats and trains can make a bridge fall down for different reasons. With trains, the speed of the impact can bring a bridge down. With boats, the very large weight they have can cause a fall down. This can happen even when they move slowly. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technology that can detect weakness in the structure, safer work environments, and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The high MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.96) scores are well-deserved, reflecting a successful preservation of the original message and key details. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies used are exemplary: the complex sentence about boats was effectively split into two shorter sentences, improving readability. Vocabulary choices were strong, with complex terms like 'velocity' and 'collapse' being simplified to 'speed' and 'fall down' respectively, which is ideal for the target audience. The paraphrasing of 'structural weakness' to 'weakness in the structure' is another effective technique that enhances clarity. Overall, this is a high-quality submission.",
