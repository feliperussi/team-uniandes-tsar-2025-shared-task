    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6296 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. This is an instant failure. The BERTScore of 0.8833 is also below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Core Meaning Lost: The original text describes 'heated arguments'. Your version, 'They talked a lot with hunters', completely removes the essential meaning of conflict and disagreement. This is a severe factual distortion.\n- Fidelity Lost: Key concepts from the original were deleted, causing the low BERTScore. Words like 'cruel', 'illegal', and 'strategy' were lost, which oversimplified the text to the point of inaccuracy.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'shooting' is B2 level. The word 'kind' is B1 level. These words are too advanced for an A2 text and are not permitted.\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning of conflict. Use A2 phrases like 'people were angry' or 'people did not agree'.\n- Suggestion: Replace non-A2 vocabulary. Use 'killing the pigs with guns' instead of 'shooting pigs'. Use 'bad' or 'wrong' instead of 'not kind'.\n- Suggestion: The text must accurately reflect the source material's key facts, including the emotional and confrontational elements.",
