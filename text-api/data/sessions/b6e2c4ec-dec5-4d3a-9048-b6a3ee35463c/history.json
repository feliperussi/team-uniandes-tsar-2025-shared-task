Your version, 'This plan may not work,' fails to convey the original's sense of ongoing struggle and likely failure. The phrase 'unnecessarily cruel' was reduced to 'not kind,' which does not carry the same weight or meaning.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8904 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing specific, important phrases like 'city residents' and 'heated arguments' with overly simple terms like 'people' and 'angry arguments,' losing lexical fidelity.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You used words that are not on the A2 list. 'Shooting' is a B2-level word. 'Illegal' is a B1-level word. These must be simplified for an A2 audience.\n- Structural Degradation: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. This damages the logical flow and contributes to the loss of meaning. For example, 'This plan may not work. Warm winters bring more pigs than before' does not clearly connect the two ideas with cause and effect.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the core concepts. Use 'against the law' instead of 'illegal'. Explain 'shooting' as 'using guns on the pigs'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6026 is critically below the 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8774 also fails to meet the minimum 0.90 requirement, confirming a significant loss of key factual phrasing.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text explains a complex situation involving a 'losing battle' due to 'warmer winters'. Your version, 'Warm winters bring more pigs', loses this critical concept of an ongoing, possibly failing, strategy.\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms from the original text such as 'city council', 'illegal', and 'strategy' were removed. This oversimplification is the direct cause of the low BERTScore.\n- CEFR Vocabulary Violation: The text uses B1-level vocabulary ('killing', 'cruel', 'peaceful') without simplification. These words are not compliant with the A2 standard.\n- CEFR Structural Violation: The sentence 'They made a rule that people cannot feed the pigs' uses a 'that-clause'. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is too complex for A2.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Restore the meaning of the 'losing battle'. Example: 'But this may not work. Warm winters mean there are more pigs.'\n- Suggestion: Simplify the B1 vocabulary. Replace 'cruel' with 'not kind' or 'very bad'. Replace 'peaceful' with 'a way that does not hurt the pigs'.\n- Suggestion: Eliminate the B1 'that-clause'. Split the sentence. Example: 'They made a new rule. People cannot feed the pigs.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6518 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8691, below the required 0.90.\n\n- Metric Failure (MeaningBERT): The score is low because your text breaks the original's logical flow into a simple list of facts. The original states the council acted 'In response to protests'. Your version, 'City council heard the protests. They chose a way...', disconnects the cause from the effect, weakening the meaning.\n\n- Metric Failure (BERTScore): The score is low due to excessive simplification of key vocabulary. 'Unnecessarily cruel' was reduced to 'not kind', and 'heated arguments' became 'argued loudly'. This loses important lexical detail and nuance from the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses B2-level words 'shooting' and 'council' without simplification. These words are not compliant with the A2 standard. An A2 text must not contain vocabulary from higher CEFR levels.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The output is a series of disconnected, simple sentences. While A2 requires simple sentences, it also requires the use of basic connectors like 'so' and 'because' to link ideas. Your text lacks these, resulting in a choppy, A1-level structure that fails to convey the relationships between events.\n\n- Suggestion: Re-write the text to connect ideas using A2-level conjunctions. Replace B2 vocabulary with A2-compliant phrases. Restore the cause-and-effect relationships present in the original text. For example: 'People said shooting pigs was very bad, so they argued with hunters. Because of the protests, the city leaders decided to stop using guns.'.",

The original text implies fences were put up to keep pigs out of areas, not to enclose them.\n\nFAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6172 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The core concept of 'unnecessarily cruel' was reduced to 'very bad', which is a significant loss of meaning.

State that fences were built to keep pigs out.\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase to explain that people thought shooting pigs was cruel or not kind.\n- Suggestion: Remove the B1 word 'killing'. Replace it with an A2-compliant phrase like 'stopped shooting them'.\n- Suggestion: Combine some sentences to improve flow.
