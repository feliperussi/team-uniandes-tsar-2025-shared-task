They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards, and some brave baboons have even entered people's houses, where they take food from kitchen cupboards and fridges. Because baboons can be aggressive and have attacked many pet animals, it is understandable that many city residents do not welcome them.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target level. This failure occurred despite the output being factually correct and successfully preserving the original meaning, as shown by the high MeaningBERT and BERTScore values. The A2 classification is likely due to the overall sentence structure being too simple for a B1 text. While the final sentence uses a good B1 structure ('Because... it is understandable that...'), the preceding sentences are less complex. Suggestion: To elevate the text to B1, introduce more varied sentence structures. For example, consider combining the first two sentences to create a more complex opening, such as: 'In cities like Cape Town, South Africa, wild animals such as baboons often enter neighbourhoods looking for food.' This adjustment would increase the structural complexity to better match the B1 target.",
