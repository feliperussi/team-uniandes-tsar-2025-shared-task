Like every child starting a new school, he felt anxious, but because of how he looks, it was an extremely difficult experience for him. Nobody wanted to sit next to him, and he noticed other children staring at him or whispering about him. Fortunately, he made friends with Jack, who was a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he chats with at lunch.\n\nBut the first day was not the only hard part. Auggie quickly found out that his classmates did not want to touch him because they were afraid of catching 'the plague'. During the school year, Auggie experienced many ups and downs. Then, an unexpected and disturbing event happened at a school camp, which changed everything completely.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.864), and fidelity (BERTScore 0.9566). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The writer effectively transformed more complex vocabulary and sentence structures from the original text into B1-appropriate language. For example, 'agonising experience' was simplified to 'extremely difficult experience,' and 'talking about him behind their hands' became 'whispering about him,' which is a clear and direct simplification of an idiomatic phrase. The phrase 'for fear of catching 'the plague'' was appropriately rephrased as 'because they were afraid of catching 'the plague',' making it more accessible for a B1 learner. The change from 'traumatic event' to 'disturbing event' also aligns well with the B1 target. The text maintains a natural flow and coherence, using appropriate B1 connectors like 'After,' 'Like,' 'but,' 'and,' 'Fortunately,' 'because,' 'During,' and 'Then.' Sentence structures are varied and clear, contributing to good readability. The paragraph break is logical and aids in structuring the narrative. Overall, this is a strong submission that meets all requirements for B1 simplification. The changes are precise and effective, making the text significantly more accessible without losing any of the original story's impact or detail.",
