Like every child starting a new school, he felt very nervous, but because of how he looks, it was a very difficult experience for him. Nobody wanted to sit next to him, and he noticed other children staring at him or talking about him quietly. Luckily, he made friends with Jack, who was a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talked with at lunch.\n\nBut the first day was not the only hard part. Auggie quickly found out that his classmates did not want to touch him because they were afraid of getting 'the plague'. During the school year, Auggie experienced many strong good and bad times. Then, a surprising and very upsetting event happened at a school camp, which changed everything completely.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. While the simplification maintained factual integrity and meaning, it oversimplified the language, resulting in a text that is too basic for the target B1 audience. Specific examples of oversimplification include: 1. Replacing 'anxious' (B2) with 'nervous' (A2). 2. Replacing 'agonising experience' (C1) with 'very difficult experience' (A2). 3. Replacing the idiomatic phrase 'behind their hands' (B2) with the simpler 'quietly' (A2). 4. Replacing 'Fortunately' (B2) with 'Luckily' (A2). 5. Replacing 'chats with' (B1) with 'talked with' (A1). 6. Replacing 'for fear of catching' (B2 structure) with 'because they were afraid of getting' (A2 structure). 7. Replacing 'intense ups and downs' (B2 idiom) with 'strong good and bad times' (A2 descriptive phrase). 8. Replacing 'unexpected and traumatic' (B2/C1) with 'surprising and very upsetting' (A2). To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to retain slightly more complex vocabulary and sentence structures. For instance, 'anxious' could have been kept, or 'agonising' could be simplified to 'extremely difficult' rather than 'very difficult'. The phrase 'behind their hands' could be rephrased to 'whispering about him' to maintain a B1 level of detail and complexity. The overall effect of these changes is a text that reads as too simple for the B1 target.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.864), and fidelity (BERTScore 0.9566). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The writer effectively transformed more complex vocabulary and sentence structures from the original text into B1-appropriate language. For example, 'agonising experience' was simplified to 'extremely difficult experience,' and 'talking about him behind their hands' became 'whispering about him,' which is a clear and direct simplification of an idiomatic phrase. The phrase 'for fear of catching 'the plague'' was appropriately rephrased as 'because they were afraid of catching 'the plague',' making it more accessible for a B1 learner. The change from 'traumatic event' to 'disturbing event' also aligns well with the B1 target. The text maintains a natural flow and coherence, using appropriate B1 connectors like 'After,' 'Like,' 'but,' 'and,' 'Fortunately,' 'because,' 'During,' and 'Then.' Sentence structures are varied and clear, contributing to good readability. The paragraph break is logical and aids in structuring the narrative. Overall, this is a strong submission that meets all requirements for B1 simplification. The changes are precise and effective, making the text significantly more accessible without losing any of the original story's impact or detail.",
