The original text's central point is that the stories are 'fundamental' and 'relevant'.

The core message has been diluted.\n\n*   Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8946 is below the minimum acceptable score of 0.90. This failure is caused by the complete removal of key descriptive concepts like 'chart-topping' and 'stadium-filling'. While simplification is required, you must find A2-level ways to represent these facts, not erase them. This has resulted in an unacceptable loss of factual detail.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the original meaning. Rephrase to communicate the concept of 'relevance' directly.

These changes, while preserving the general meaning, fail the strict lexical fidelity requirement. The text correctly achieved an A2 classification and preserved the core message (MeaningBERT score 0.7688), but the fidelity rule is absolute. Suggestion: Retain more of the original key terms.
