        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Narrative Inconsistency. The text fails due to an inconsistent and incorrect use of verb tenses, which alters the meaning and context of the original story.\n\n- Tense Violation: The original text is written entirely in the past tense to describe a specific event ('arrived', 'made', 'wanted'). Your output begins in the past tense ('came', 'made', 'took') but then incorrectly shifts to the present and future tense ('can do', 'will come', 'is noisy', 'talk', 'cooks').\n\n- Meaning Alteration: This tense shift changes the story from a description of one particular afternoon into a description of a general, repeated routine. This is a failure to preserve the original narrative frame.\n\n- Specific Errors: The sentences 'Soon, her parents will come home. Then the house is noisy. They talk and watch TV.' are incorrect. They should reflect the past context of the original.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the entire text using a consistent past tense to match the original. Change 'her parents will come home' to 'her parents would come home' or a simpler A2 alternative like 'She wanted a quiet hour before her parents came home.' Change 'the house is noisy' to 'the house was noisy.' Maintain the past tense throughout the description.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.852 and BERTScore of 0.9245 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. All words are appropriate for the target audience.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's longer, more complex sentences have been correctly deconstructed into short, simple sentences suitable for the A2 level. The use of basic connectors like 'But', 'and', and 'because' is exemplary.",
