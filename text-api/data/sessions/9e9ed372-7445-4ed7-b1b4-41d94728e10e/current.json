    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 CEFR readability standards while preserving factual integrity and meaning. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8058 and BERTScore of 0.9384 confirm excellent fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. Vocabulary is appropriately simplified (e.g., 'risky' to 'dangerous', 'functioning' to 'not work well', 'increase the challenge' to 'make it harder'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using A2-level connectors like 'So'. No B1 or higher vocabulary or complex grammatical structures were detected.",
