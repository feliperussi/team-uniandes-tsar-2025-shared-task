This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary loss of meaning is as follows: The original text emphasizes Gerlinde's deliberate choice 'To increase the challenge' by climbing without oxygen. Your version states 'This makes it more difficult' but fails to convey her intentionality in making the climb harder for herself. This is a critical nuance lost. Additionally, 'affect brain and body functioning' is simplified to 'hurt her head and body', which loses some of the specific medical implications of low oxygen levels. Suggestion: Rephrase to clearly state Gerlinde's intention to make the climb more challenging for herself. Ensure the impact of low oxygen is conveyed with more precision than just 'hurt'.",

While the text maintains factual accuracy, it fails to fully preserve the nuanced meaning and relationships present in the original text. The overall message is diluted and fragmented. Specific deviations include: The original text 'Having climbed Everest, Gerlinde decided to climb all fourteen...' conveys a deliberate decision made after a significant achievement. Your version 'Gerlinde climbed Everest. Now she wants to climb all 14...' separates these ideas, losing the sense of a sequential, post-Everest decision and making it sound like a general, current desire. The specific nature of 'support a charity' is diluted to 'help a group'. 'Charity' implies a formal, organized effort for public good, which 'a group' does not fully convey, thus losing a layer of meaning regarding Gerlinde's philanthropic activities. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to better connect Gerlinde's Everest climb with her subsequent decision to climb the other peaks, preserving the original's sense of progression and deliberate choice. Use a more specific term than 'group' to describe the organization she helps, such as 'charity' or 'organization', if those terms are within A2 vocabulary, or ensure the simplified phrase clearly implies a formal aid effort.",

The core message regarding the specific challenge and the detailed risks of climbing without oxygen has been diluted. The text fails to convey the full meaning of the original. \n\n*   The original text states 'To increase the challenge, Gerlinde climbs without using oxygen tanks.' Your version, 'She wants to make it more difficult. So she climbs without oxygen,' loses the direct link between the method (no oxygen) and the purpose (increasing the challenge). The nuance of 'increase the challenge' is not fully captured by 'make it more difficult' in this context. \n*   The original text explains the risk: 'low oxygen levels at the top of high mountains can affect brain and body functioning.' Your version, 'This is dangerous. There is little oxygen at the top of high mountains. This can make her brain and body not work well,' simplifies 'affect brain and body functioning' to 'not work well', which diminishes the specific and severe impact described in the original. The causal link is also less explicit. \n*   The original text connects 'uses her fame as a climber to support a charity'. Your version separates 'Gerlinde is a famous climber. She uses her fame to help a group', which weakens the direct purpose of her fame. \n\nSuggestion: Reconstruct the sentences to explicitly link the lack of oxygen to the increased challenge. Restore the specific impact of low oxygen on 'functioning' of the brain and body. Ensure the use of her fame is directly tied to her identity as a climber supporting the charity.",

Similarly, 'Having climbed Everest' implies a foundational achievement that leads to her next decision, whereas 'Gerlinde climbed Everest.

The core message and nuances of the original text have been lost or altered. Specific issues include: The original text explicitly links the act of climbing without oxygen to the reason 'To increase the challenge'. Your version separates these into two distinct sentences 'She climbs without oxygen. She wants to make the climb harder.', which weakens the causal connection and the specific intent. The phrase 'can affect brain and body functioning' from the original is replaced with 'can stop her brain and body from working well'. 'Affect functioning' implies a range of impacts, while 'stop working well' is a more absolute and potentially inaccurate interpretation of the original meaning. The word 'orphans' is an A2 word and should have been retained for lexical fidelity. Replacing it with 'children with no parents' unnecessarily alters the specific terminology, contributing to the meaning loss. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the original causal relationships and the precise meaning of key phrases. Retain A2 vocabulary where appropriate for fidelity.",
