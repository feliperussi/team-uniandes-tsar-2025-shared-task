    "text_translated": "\"Born in the USA\" is a rock album. The music is fast and makes you move your feet. But the words in the songs have deep and important feelings.\n\nThe music is easy to remember. The songs are very strong, famous old songs. But the stories are about the dark side of the American dream. Many songs are about the problems of hard-working ordinary people. They do not become rich or famous. So they feel angry and unhappy about their lives.\n\nFor example, one song is \"Glory Days\". It is about people in a small town. They think about the past. They were young and had a great future. Another song is \"Downbound Train\". It tells the story of a young man. He loses his job. His life is ruined after this.\n\nThe artist probably knew real people like this. He writes about their lives. Maybe his life was going to be like that. But then he became a star. This album makes it clear the artist is special. He is called \"the Boss\". This album shows he is very good at making music.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6994, which is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text conveys a strong sense of 'bitterness', 'anger', and 'struggle'. Your version dilutes this to 'unhappy' and 'problems', which fails to capture the emotional weight. The original's 'unique and extraordinary talent' is reduced to 'special' and 'very good', losing the intended emphasis.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8952 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key lexical items like 'powerhouse classics', 'emotional weight', and 'channelling real people' with overly simplistic phrases. This damages the fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'making' in the phrase 'good at making music' is a B2-level gerund. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the original meaning. The concepts of 'bitterness' and 'extraordinary talent' must be communicated using A2 vocabulary. Replace the B2 word 'making'. State 'He writes very good music' or 'He is a very good musician' instead.",
