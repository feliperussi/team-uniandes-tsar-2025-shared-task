They have sad feelings.\n\nThe music is easy to remember. The songs are famous and strong. But the stories in the songs are sad. They are about the bad side of life in America. Many songs are about the problems of normal people. These people work very hard. But their life is difficult. They do not become rich or famous. So they feel sad and angry.\n\nFor example, one song is \"Glory Days\". It is about people in a small town. They think about the past. They were young and happy then. Another song is \"Downbound Train\". It tells the story of a young man. He loses his job. His life becomes very bad.\n\nThe artist probably knew real people like this. He writes about their lives. Maybe his life was going to be like that. But then he became a star. This album shows you the artist is special. He is called \"the Boss\". He has an amazing talent.",

This indicates a critical loss of both core meaning and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's concepts of 'emotional weight' and 'the dark side of the American dream' were oversimplified into 'sad feelings' and 'the bad side of life in America'. This loses the specific cultural and emotional context, causing the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: Key phrases from the original such as 'hard-working ordinary people', 'life is ruined', and 'extraordinary talent' were replaced with generic terms like 'normal people', 'life becomes very bad', and 'amazing talent'. This loss of specific vocabulary caused the low BERTScore.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'talent', which is classified as B1 level. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. An A2 text must not contain B1 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to better capture the original's core concepts using only A2 vocabulary. The concept of a 'ruined' life must be conveyed more strongly than 'becomes very bad'. The B1 word 'talent' must be replaced. Use a phrase like 'He has a special skill for music' or 'He is very good at writing songs'.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8904 is below the required 0.90 threshold, indicating a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text's concept of 'emotional weight' was reduced to 'serious feelings'. The 'bitterness and anger' felt by the characters was simplified to 'angry and sad', losing the specific nuance of bitterness.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key descriptive phrases that define the original text's tone were removed. 'Powerhouse classics' became 'famous and strong'. The phrase 'life is ruined' was replaced with the much weaker 'everything in his life goes wrong'. This loss of specific vocabulary caused the BERTScore to fall below the minimum requirement.\n\n- Over-simplification: While the text successfully achieved an A2 classification, it did so by sacrificing too much of the original's meaning and lexical detail. The goal is simplification, not erasure of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to restore the core concepts. The idea of 'bitterness' must be included. The severity of a 'ruined' life must be communicated more strongly than 'goes wrong'. You must increase fidelity to the source text's meaning while maintaining simple A2 sentence structures.",
