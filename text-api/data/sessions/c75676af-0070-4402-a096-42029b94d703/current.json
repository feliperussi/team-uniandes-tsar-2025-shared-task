    "text_translated": "I used to work a normal five-day week. After my new baby, I took some time off work. I wanted to spend more time with my children before they started school. I talked with my boss, and we agreed to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay. This is because I am paid for the number of days I work. However, I have noticed my amount of work has not changed at all. I now do five days of work in only three days. But I am getting paid much less for it.",
