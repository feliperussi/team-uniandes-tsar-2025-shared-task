I talked with my boss, and we agreed to reduce my schedule to a three-day work week. Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay, because I am paid for the number of days I work. However, I have noticed that my amount of work has not changed at all. I am now doing five days of work in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it",

For example, 'But after I had time off for my new baby, I decided I wanted to spend more time with my children before they start school' is 27 words. This must be broken into shorter sentences. The sentences 'Of course, this also meant a big cut in my pay...' (22 words) and 'I am now doing five days of work...' (21 words) are also too long. Sentences must not exceed approximately 15 words."
