Some dogs have even learned to use the city's metro system to go from one area to another. Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their very good sense of smell, and they have learned to know the smells of their favourite places. Another idea is that they have learned to know the names of stations which they hear in announcements. In any case, people who use the metro have now become so used to seeing dogs on the trains that local people mostly do not notice them.",

Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating successful simplification to the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The writer effectively replaced more complex vocabulary such as 'packs' with 'groups', 'humans' with 'people', 'excellent' with 'very good', 'recognise the scents' with 'know the smells', and 'destinations' with 'places'. The sentence structures are clear and appropriate for a B1 level, and the text flows smoothly. The use of connectors like 'so', 'and', and 'In any case' aids coherence.
