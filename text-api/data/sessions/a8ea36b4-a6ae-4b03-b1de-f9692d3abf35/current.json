    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7016 is below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the nuances of 'power distance' cultures has been diluted. The text fails to fully capture the depth of the original meaning. Specific deviations include: The original text emphasizes 'power and authority are respected', but your version simplifies this to 'people respected power and leaders', losing the specific concept of 'authority' which is central to high power distance. The term 'subordinates' was replaced with 'workers', which, while simpler, loses some of the hierarchical implication crucial to the topic. The phrase 'leaders act as coaches or mentors who encourage independent thought' was simplified to 'Leaders were like coaches. They also helped people learn. They helped workers think for themselves.' This softens the active role of leaders in fostering independent thought and loses the specific nuance of 'mentors'. The strong expectation implied by 'expect to be challenged' is weakened by the phrasing 'They wanted workers to ask them questions. They wanted workers to tell them if they disagreed.', which makes the leader's role sound less proactive in seeking challenge. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the specific concepts of 'authority' and 'subordinates'. Ensure the active role of leaders in encouraging independent thought and expecting challenge is clearly conveyed.",
