    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The Capitol uses the games to punish the different areas of the country. This is because the areas fought against the Capitol in the past. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area. They are between 12 and 18 years old. They choose them in a lottery. This means the choice is by chance. They have to fight in a game. Only one person can live. They call these young people 'tributes'. Tributes are the people who fight in the games. All the people in the country have to watch the games on TV.",
