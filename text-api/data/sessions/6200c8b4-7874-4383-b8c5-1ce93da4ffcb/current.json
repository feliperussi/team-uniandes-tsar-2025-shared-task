This writing on walls is called graffiti (= words or pictures on walls). People found graffiti on very old buildings in Greece, Italy, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nIn the old Roman town of Pompeii, people also found a lot of graffiti. The writing was in the Latin language.

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6392 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states the existence of \"magic spells\". Your output changes this from a statement of fact into a lengthy explanation: \"Some messages were like magic. People believed the words had power to make things happen.\" This semantic shift is the main cause of the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Secondary Deviation: The replacement of abstract categories (\"religious, political and romantic messages\") with concrete examples (\"God, the government, and love\") also contributes to the semantic drift, altering the meaning from general categories to specific instances.\n- Structural Issue: While attempting to simplify, you created two sentences to explain one concept (\"magic spells\"), which is inefficient and caused the meaning preservation failure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning directly and concisely. Replace the two sentences explaining magic with a single, factually aligned sentence. Rephrase to state that some messages were magic spells, not just 'like magic'.",
