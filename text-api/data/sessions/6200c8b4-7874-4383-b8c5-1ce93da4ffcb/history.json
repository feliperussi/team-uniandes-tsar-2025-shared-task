This is a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text presents a narrative about the historical continuity of people writing on walls, introducing the term 'graffiti' within that context. Your version inverts this structure by starting with a definition of 'graffiti' and then listing historical facts. This change from a historical narrative to a simple definition with examples fundamentally alters the message and is the direct cause of the low meaning score. While the individual facts are correct, the story they tell is not the same. Suggestion: Re-structure the text to follow the original's narrative flow. Begin with the general concept of people painting on walls throughout history. Then, introduce the specific examples from ancient sites as evidence of this long-standing activity.",

This simplification was too aggressive and damaged the meaning.\n*   Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'magic' was used. All vocabulary must be strictly A2. This word is not on the approved list and was not simplified.\n*   Structural Weakness: The sentence structure is overly simplistic and repetitive, which contributes to the meaning loss.
