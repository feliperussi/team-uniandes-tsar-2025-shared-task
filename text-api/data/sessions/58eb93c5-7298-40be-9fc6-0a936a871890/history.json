        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. The primary reason for this classification is the complexity of the final sentence: 'However, research suggests that we can help people develop new skills and make their natural abilities even better if we focus on the process of how things are done, for example, by praising their hard work, their attempts to try new things, and their ways of solving problems.' This sentence is too long and contains multiple clauses and complex parallel structures (e.g., 'by praising their hard work, their attempts to try new things, and their ways of solving problems') which push it beyond the B1 grammatical complexity threshold. To achieve B1, consider splitting this sentence into two or three shorter sentences. For instance, you could separate the 'research suggests' part from the 'how to help people' part, and then list the examples more simply. The text passed the Factual Integrity Check (Priority 1) and the Meaning and Fidelity Check (Priority 2) with a MeaningBERT score of 0.8632 and a BERTScore of 0.9214, indicating good preservation of content and meaning.",

        "feedback_text": "The text failed the CEFR Compliance Check. The CEFR classifier result was 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. While the vocabulary simplification was effective, the grammatical complexity of some sentences remains too high for a B1 learner. For example, the sentence 'However, research suggests that we can help people develop new skills and make their natural abilities even better if we focus on the process of how things are done' combines a subordinate clause with a conditional clause. This multi-clause structure is more typical of a B2 level. To meet the B1 requirement, such complex sentences should be broken down into two or more simpler, shorter sentences. For instance, the example sentence could be split to: 'However, research suggests something. We can help people develop new skills and make their natural abilities even better. This happens if we focus on the process of how things are done.' This would significantly reduce the cognitive load for a B1 reader.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8311 and BERTScore of 0.9185 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, 'plasticity of the brain' was simplified to 'brain's ability to change', 'seemingly innate talents' to 'abilities that seem natural', and 'honing of talents' to 'make their natural abilities even better'. The keyword 'growth mindset' was clearly defined within the text. Sentence splitting was used effectively to break down longer, more complex sentences into shorter, more digestible units, particularly in the final paragraph, which enhances readability for a B1 learner. The use of connectors like 'However' and 'For example' aids in maintaining a coherent flow. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that meets all requirements and provides a clear, accurate, and accessible version of the original text.",
