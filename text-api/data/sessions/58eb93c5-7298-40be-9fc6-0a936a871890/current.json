    "text_translated": "Carol Dweck, who is an expert on the mind, talked about the brain's ability to change. She believed in a 'growth mindset', which is the idea that we can develop skills and natural abilities, even if we were not good at them at first. Many of us often praise the final result and abilities that seem natural. For example, we might say, 'You are good at seeing details' or 'You have a natural ability for organising events'. However, research suggests something important. We can help people develop new skills and make their natural abilities even better. This happens if we focus on the *process* of how things are done. For example, we can praise their hard work, their attempts to try new things, and their ways of solving problems.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8311 and BERTScore of 0.9185 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, 'plasticity of the brain' was simplified to 'brain's ability to change', 'seemingly innate talents' to 'abilities that seem natural', and 'honing of talents' to 'make their natural abilities even better'. The keyword 'growth mindset' was clearly defined within the text. Sentence splitting was used effectively to break down longer, more complex sentences into shorter, more digestible units, particularly in the final paragraph, which enhances readability for a B1 learner. The use of connectors like 'However' and 'For example' aids in maintaining a coherent flow. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that meets all requirements and provides a clear, accurate, and accessible version of the original text.",
