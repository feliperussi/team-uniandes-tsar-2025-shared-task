    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a perfect factual match to the original text. No information was lost or altered.\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.80 and BERTScore of 0.91 are well above the required thresholds. The core message about the workload-to-pay imbalance is perfectly preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The linguistic profile is an exact match for the target level.\n- Vocabulary Audit: All vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. Complex concepts like 'parental leave', 'negotiating', and 'pro-rata basis' were correctly simplified into A2-level phrases like 'took time off work', 'talked to my boss', and 'only get paid for the days I work'.\n- Structural Analysis: The use of short, simple sentences connected by basic conjunctions ('so', 'but', 'and') is an exemplary model for A2 readability. The complex sentence structures of the original have been successfully deconstructed into clear, sequential statements.",
