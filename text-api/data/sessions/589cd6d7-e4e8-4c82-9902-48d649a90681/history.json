This indicates that key words and phrasing from the original text were lost during simplification.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The aggressive simplification into very short sentences caused a drop in lexical similarity. The phrase 'two defence solutions could be launched' was changed to 'two ways to keep Earth safe', which preserves meaning but loses too much of the original phrasing, resulting in the low BERTScore.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'within' is classified as B1 level. Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Replace the B1 word 'within'. Rephrase the sentence to 'They come near Earth, less than 7.5 million kilometres away.' This is A2 compliant. Suggestion: To improve the BERTScore, rephrase sentences to be slightly closer to the original's vocabulary where possible without sacrificing A2 simplicity.",

This indicates a significant loss of lexical detail from the original text, making the output a poor representation despite its simplicity.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'launch' and 'defence'. These are not A2 compliant and must be simplified. The presence of B1 vocabulary is an automatic failure.\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The keyword 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was not defined in simple A2 terms. The term was used without explanation, which is unacceptable.\n- Structural Simplification Error: The connection between predicting an impact and launching a defence solution ('at which point') was completely lost. This resulted in two disconnected statements and contributed to the low fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'launch' with 'send up'. Replace 'defence solutions' with 'ways to protect Earth'. Combine the final two sentences to restore the cause-and-effect relationship, for example: 'If NASA predicts a rock will hit Earth, it could send up two things to protect us.'",
