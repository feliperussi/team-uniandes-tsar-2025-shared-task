    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8972 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of lexical detail from the original text, making the output a poor representation despite its simplicity.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'launch' and 'defence'. These are not A2 compliant and must be simplified. The presence of B1 vocabulary is an automatic failure.\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The keyword 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was not defined in simple A2 terms. The term was used without explanation, which is unacceptable.\n- Structural Simplification Error: The connection between predicting an impact and launching a defence solution ('at which point') was completely lost. This resulted in two disconnected statements and contributed to the low fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'launch' with 'send up'. Replace 'defence solutions' with 'ways to protect Earth'. Combine the final two sentences to restore the cause-and-effect relationship, for example: 'If NASA predicts a rock will hit Earth, it could send up two things to protect us.'",
