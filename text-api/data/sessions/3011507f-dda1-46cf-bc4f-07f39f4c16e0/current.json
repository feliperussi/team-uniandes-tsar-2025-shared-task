    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games because people did not follow the rules in the past. The games are a bad thing for the people. Every year, the government chooses one boy and one girl from each area. The government picks their names by lottery. This means they pick the names by chance. The children are between 12 and 18 years old. The government calls these children 'tributes'. 'Tributes' is the special name for the children who must fight. They must fight each other until only one person is alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on TV.",
