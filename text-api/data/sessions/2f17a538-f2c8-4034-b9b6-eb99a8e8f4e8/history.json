        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. This failure is due to the syntactic complexity of the final sentence: 'She supported street artists, saying that artists who paint on the street are just expressing themselves and not hurting anyone, and that they should be appreciated and celebrated.' The combination of a participial clause ('saying that...'), an embedded relative clause ('who paint on the street'), and a compound reported speech structure is too advanced for the B1 level. To fix this, split the final sentence into two or three simpler sentences. For example: 'She supported street artists. She said that artists who paint on the street are just expressing themselves and not hurting anyone. She also said they should be appreciated and celebrated.' On a positive note, the text passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks, and the strategy for defining keywords was executed perfectly.",

Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.86 and BERTScore of 0.96 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key details were fully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved a B1 classification. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy is outstanding. The in-line definition of the keywords 'graffiti' and 'street art' is a model technique. Furthermore, the decision to split the final complex sentence into three shorter, clearer sentences significantly improves readability for the target audience. Vocabulary choices like 'supported' for 'defended' are perfectly judged. No improvements are necessary.",
