Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.86 and BERTScore of 0.96 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key details were fully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved a B1 classification. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy is outstanding. The in-line definition of the keywords 'graffiti' and 'street art' is a model technique. Furthermore, the decision to split the final complex sentence into three shorter, clearer sentences significantly improves readability for the target audience. Vocabulary choices like 'supported' for 'defended' are perfectly judged. No improvements are necessary.",
