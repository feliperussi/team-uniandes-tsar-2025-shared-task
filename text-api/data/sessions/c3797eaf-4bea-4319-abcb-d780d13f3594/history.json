MeaningBERT score of 0.7741 and BERTScore of 0.9015 both meet the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2, with complex original terms like 'parental leave', 'negotiating', 'pro-rata basis', and 'workload hasn't decreased in the slightest' expertly simplified to A2 equivalents such as 'time off for my baby', 'talked to my manager. We agreed.', 'They pay me for the hours I work.', and 'My work did not get smaller.'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to appropriate A2 conjunctions like 'Then', 'After that', and 'But then'. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
