The text also fails on CEFR compliance and contains B1-level vocabulary and grammar.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because the simplification process removed key descriptive words from the original text. For example, 'unique and extraordinary talent' was reduced to 'unique talent', losing lexical detail and causing a drop in fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, which is too complex for the A2 standard. This is a direct violation of the core requirement.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The text uses words above the A2 level. 'talent' is B1. The phrasal verb 'falls apart' is B1. The word 'bitterness' is an abstract noun above the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'That is if he had not become a star' is a sentence fragment that uses a past conditional structure. This is a B1 grammatical form and is unacceptable.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace all B1 vocabulary. 'talent' must be replaced with a word like 'skill'. 'falls apart' must be rephrased to 'becomes very bad'. 'bitterness' must be simplified to 'unhappiness' or 'sadness'. The B1 conditional sentence must be completely rewritten into simple A2 sentences, such as: 'He thinks about a different life. In that life, he did not become a star.'",

This indicates a critical loss of key words and phrasing from the original text due to over-simplification.\n\n- Primary Violation: The text sacrifices lexical fidelity for extreme structural simplicity. While the CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as A2, the content has been stripped of too much detail from the source.\n- Evidence of Fidelity Loss: Key concepts were replaced with overly simple phrases, causing the low BERTScore. For example, 'life is ruined' became 'life becomes very bad', and 'unique and extraordinary talent' became 'very special skill'. These changes alter the texture and precision of the original text too much.\n- Structural Issue: The text is excessively fragmented. The use of numerous short, disconnected sentences makes the text unnatural and difficult to read, even for an A2 learner. For example: 'The words talk about the dark side. They talk about the American dream.'\n- Suggestion: Revise the text to retain more of the original's A2-compatible vocabulary. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'because' to create a more natural flow. The objective is simplification, not total replacement of the original's lexicon.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While simplification is necessary for A2, the core lexical detail has been overly reduced.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low. Phrases like 'unique and extraordinary talent' were reduced to 'special skill', and 'fast-paced, foot-tapping' became 'fast beats'. This level of simplification sacrifices too much of the original's specific vocabulary, causing the fidelity score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B2-level words 'means' and 'being'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard. The sentence 'The American dream means...' is an unacceptable B2 construction.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence '...a man who loses his job' uses a defining relative clause ('who-clause'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. The sentence 'They remember when they were young...' uses a 'when-clause', also a B1 structure. A2 texts must use simpler sentence constructions.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore more specific vocabulary from the original to meet the 0.90 BERTScore threshold. Remove the B2 words 'means' and 'being'. Split the sentences containing 'who' and 'when' into simpler, separate A2-level sentences. For example: 'Another song is about a man. He loses his job.'",

The simplification process has removed the meaning of key descriptive words.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is due to vocabulary and sentence structure violations.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'bitterness' is B1 level. The word 'ruined' is B1 level. These are too advanced for an A2 audience.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'The artist thinks about a different life he could have had' uses a reduced relative clause, which is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'The album shows the Boss is very good at making music' uses a 'verb + that-clause' structure, which is a B1 structure.\n- Idiom Violation: The phrase 'the world was at their feet' is an idiom and is too complex for A2 learners.\n- Fidelity Loss: Key concepts from the original text such as 'powerhouse classics', 'struggles', 'unique', and 'extraordinary talent' were completely omitted, not simplified. This caused the low BERTScore.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to remove all B1 elements. Replace 'bitterness' with 'unhappiness and anger'. Replace 'ruined' with 'becomes very bad'. Split the complex sentences. Example: 'The artist thinks about his life. It could have been different.' Re-integrate the meaning of omitted words using simple A2 terms. Example: Instead of omitting 'extraordinary talent', state 'The Boss has a special talent for music.'",

These are not permitted.\n- Structural Complexity Violation: The sentence 'The American dream means anyone can be successful' provides an abstract definition, which is a B1-level linguistic function. The structure is too complex for A2.\n- The phrase 'powerful classics' was retained from the original text's vocabulary level, which is incorrect for an A2 simplification.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Action: Remove all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'means', 'powerful', and 'talent'.\n- Action: Rephrase the definition of 'American dream' using A2 structures. Example: 'The American dream is an idea. The idea is that anyone can be successful.'\n- Action: Replace 'powerful classics'. Suggestion: 'very famous old songs'.\n- Action: Replace 'special talent'. Suggestion: 'is very good at music'.",
