    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8751 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\nCEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n\nB1 Vocabulary Violation: The final sentence, 'The album shows the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss,' uses the B1-level words 'extraordinary' and 'talent'. These words are too advanced for the A2 level and must be simplified.\n\nLexical Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of oversimplification that lost the specific vocabulary of the original. Phrases like 'life is ruined' became 'life becomes very bad', and 'leave you in no doubt' became 'album shows'. While the meaning is generally correct, the fidelity to the source text's vocabulary is too low.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentence completely to use only A1/A2 vocabulary. Example: 'The album shows the Boss is a very special and good musician.' Review the entire text to restore key words from the original where possible without violating A2 standards to improve the fidelity score.",
