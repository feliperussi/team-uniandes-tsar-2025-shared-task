This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and intent. The simplification has removed critical aspects of the original meaning. Specifically, the original text emphasizes 'conservation issues' and the idea of 'inspiring people to protect animals and their habitats'. Your version simplifies this to 'teach people about animals', 'teach how to keep animals safe', and 'teach about animal homes'. While related, 'conservation issues' implies a broader, more complex topic than simply 'keeping animals safe', and the concept of 'inspiration' is entirely lost. This oversimplification dilutes the educational and motivational purpose highlighted in the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening sentences to more accurately convey the depth of 'conservation issues' and the 'inspirational' aspect of zoos' educational role, even within A2 vocabulary. For example, 'Zoos help people learn about problems animals have' or 'Zoos make people want to help animals'.",

The original states that zoos 'have the potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats'. Your version simplifies this to 'They can teach people about problems for nature and animals. They can make people care about protecting animals and their homes.' This simplification loses the crucial nuance of 'potential' and the specific concept of 'conservation issues'. 'Problems for nature and animals' is too general and does not fully capture the meaning of 'conservation issues'. Additionally, 'make people care' is a weaker expression than 'inspire people to protect', diminishing the original's intent.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6309 is too low, falling significantly below the required 0.75. The core message and nuanced intent of the original text have been diluted, indicating a failure to fully preserve the meaning. Specific deviations include: The original text emphasizes the 'potential' of zoos to educate and inspire. Your version states what they 'can teach' and 'can make people want', which loses the crucial concept of 'potential' or 'capacity' that zoos possess. The phrase 'conservation issues' in the original is a specific and comprehensive term. Your simplification to 'saving animals and nature' is too broad and loses the specific focus on the challenges and problems related to conservation. The word 'inspire' in the original conveys a strong emotional impact. Your replacement 'make people want to protect' is weaker and does not fully capture the original's intent. The term 'habitats' is a precise ecological term. Replacing it with the more general 'homes' simplifies the vocabulary but also reduces the specificity of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening sentences to explicitly convey the 'potential' or 'capacity' of zoos. Use more precise A2-level equivalents for 'conservation issues' that retain the nuance of problems or challenges. Find an A2 verb that better captures the idea of 'inspiring' rather than simply 'making people want'.",

Your version simplifies this to 'They can do good things. They can teach people about problems for animals. They can encourage people to protect animals.

The phrase 'They can do good things' is overly vague and generic, losing the specific sense of purpose, potential, and the active role of zoos in conservation and inspiration that is central to the original meaning. While individual points are present, the overarching message of their specific mission is diluted. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to more directly convey the specific potential and purpose of zoos in education and inspiration, rather than using a general statement like 'They can do good things'.",
