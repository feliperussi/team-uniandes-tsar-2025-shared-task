    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5929 is significantly below the required 0.75. The writer's output fails to adequately preserve the core message and specific purpose of zoos as outlined in the original text. The original text emphasizes the 'potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats'. Your version simplifies this to 'They can do good things. They can teach people about problems for animals. They can encourage people to protect animals. They can also encourage people to protect the places where animals live.' The phrase 'They can do good things' is overly vague and generic, losing the specific sense of purpose, potential, and the active role of zoos in conservation and inspiration that is central to the original meaning. While individual points are present, the overarching message of their specific mission is diluted. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to more directly convey the specific potential and purpose of zoos in education and inspiration, rather than using a general statement like 'They can do good things'.",
