    "feedback": "PASS: All CEFR A2 readability standards have been met with precision. The text demonstrates unwavering adherence to the diagnostic protocol. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8227) and BERTScore (0.903) metrics are well within the acceptable range, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2-level, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, utilizing only basic connectors such as 'and' and 'that' for simple clauses. The complex ideas from the original text, such as 'reflects how life is full of change with its cycle of endings and new beginnings', have been expertly broken down into highly accessible A2 sentences like 'It shows that life changes a lot. Life has ends. Life has new starts.' This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
