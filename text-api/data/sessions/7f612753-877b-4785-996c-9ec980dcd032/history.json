It maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning, and adheres to the A2 linguistic complexity requirements. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8316 and BERTScore of 0.9046 are well within the acceptable range, indicating excellent fidelity to the original text's meaning and lexical content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with no detected B1 or higher words. Sentence structures are simple and direct, using appropriate A1/A2 connectors such as 'and' and 'or'. The use of 'that' as a conjunction in 'She likes that street art is not for a long time' is acceptable for A2. The simplification of concepts like 'explore different locations' to 'look in different places' and 'abandoned cars' to 'old cars' demonstrates effective A2 adaptation.",

The rule states that connectors should be limited to 'and', 'but', 'so', 'because'. The text used the connector 'Or' in the sentence 'Or city cleaners take it away.', which is not included in the permitted list. While the text otherwise demonstrates strong A2 vocabulary and sentence simplification, this specific deviation from the structural protocol results in a fail. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence to avoid the use of 'Or' as a connector, for example, by splitting it into two independent sentences or using an allowed connector if appropriate.",

The complex ideas from the original text, such as 'reflects how life is full of change with its cycle of endings and new beginnings', have been expertly broken down into highly accessible A2 sentences like 'It shows that life changes a lot. Life has ends. Life has new starts.' This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
