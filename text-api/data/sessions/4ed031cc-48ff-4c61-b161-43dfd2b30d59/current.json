She talked about what children learn from them.\n\nTeenagers see their parents do things. They see them use social media when they cook. Or they see them use it at a red light. So, teenagers also text when they do their homework. We cannot be surprised by this.\n\nShe also said another true thing. People want to be in many places at the same time. So they change between talking in real life and talking online. I see this with my daughter and her friends. They plan to meet. Then they sit together. But they do not talk.
