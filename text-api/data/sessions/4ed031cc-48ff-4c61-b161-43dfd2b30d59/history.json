So, teenagers also text when they do their homework. We cannot be surprised by this.\n\nShe also said another true thing. People want to be in many places at the same time.

It maintains factual integrity and meaning while strictly adhering to A2 linguistic standards.\n\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is perfectly constrained to the A2 level, as confirmed by the vocabulary analysis. Words like 'speaker' and 'social media' are appropriate for the level.\n- Sentence Structure: The text consistently uses short, simple sentences. Complex ideas from the original are broken down into manageable A2-level statements. For example, the original's complex question about parental influence is correctly simplified into direct statements like \"So, teenagers also text when they do their homework. We cannot be surprised by this.\"\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required range. The BERTScore of 0.9095 and MeaningBERT of 0.7969 confirm high fidelity to the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as A2.",
