    "feedback": "The writer\u2019s output is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning with a MeaningBERT score of 0.8394 and a BERTScore of 0.9302, and it correctly meets the B1 CEFR level. The added definition of \u201casteroid\u201d fulfills the keyword requirement, and the choice of simpler verbs like \u201crecord\u201d for \u201clog\u201d and \u201cfound\u201d for \u201caccounted for\u201d aligns with the vocabulary strategy. To improve fluency and coherence, consider combining short sentences using connectors (for example, link the numbers sentence with \u201cso far\u201d into the previous sentence) and vary sentence openings beyond \u201cThey\u201d and \u201cIn 2013.\u201d You might also replace \u201cThey think there are 25,000 of this size\u201d with \u201cNASA estimates there are 25,000 asteroids of this size\u201d to maintain focus on the agency conducting the work. These adjustments will enhance cohesion and reader engagement while keeping the text at B1 level.",
