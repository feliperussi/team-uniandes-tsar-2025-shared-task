The text was classified as 'B2' likely because the sentence 'This shows that medium asteroids could pose a great risk if they come into Earth\u2019s orbit.' uses the advanced verb 'pose' and a complex conditional structure that is more typical of B2. To correct this, replace 'pose a great risk' with a simpler phrase such as 'be very dangerous' and consider splitting the clause: for example, 'This shows that medium asteroids could be very dangerous. They could hit Earth\u2019s orbit and cause damage.'",
