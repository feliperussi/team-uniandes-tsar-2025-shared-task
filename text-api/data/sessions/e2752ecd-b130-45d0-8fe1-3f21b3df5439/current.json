    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6765 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text's central idea is that we make poor purchasing decisions, resulting in things not being 'put to good use'. Your version, 'some are not used well', is a neutral observation that loses this critical nuance of waste and poor judgment.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'used' is a B1-level word. Its presence in the text violates the strict A2 vocabulary requirement.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to restore the original meaning. Change 'some are not used well' to 'we see that we do not use many of our things'. Replace the B1 word 'used' with an A2-compliant alternative.",
