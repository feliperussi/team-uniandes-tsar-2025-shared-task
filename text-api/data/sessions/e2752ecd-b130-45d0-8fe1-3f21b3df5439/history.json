Your output is a series of disconnected commands and statements ('Look at the things you own... You will see something.') which completely fails to capture this reflective meaning.\n\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8757 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a fidelity failure. Key phrases like 'put to good use' were replaced with the overly simplistic 'do not use all your things', losing important nuance.\n\n- Structural Defect: The text is excessively fragmented. The first four sentences are so short and choppy that they destroy the logical flow and cause the meaning preservation failure.\n\n- Suggestion: Re-write the introduction as a single, cohesive idea. Combine the first four sentences using simple connectors to explain that when you look at your things, you might see that you do not use all of them.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's central idea is that we own things that are not 'put to good use', implying waste or poor decisions. Your version, 'you do not use all of them', is a factual but shallow simplification that loses this essential meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8777 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing specific descriptive language ('thick woollen coat', 'tropical country', 'guest room', 'storeroom') with overly simple terms ('warm coat', 'hot country', 'extra room', 'room for old things'). This sacrifices too much detail.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is broken into excessively short, disconnected sentences. This level of simplification is closer to A1 than the expected A2 level, resulting in a choppy and unnatural text flow.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase the opening to 'When you look at your things, you might see that some are not very useful.' Combine the fragmented sentences to create more natural A2 structures. Example: 'You have a warm coat, but you live in a hot country.' Reintroduce slightly more specific vocabulary to meet the fidelity requirement. Example: 'Some people have a room for visitors, but it is now a room to keep old things.'",
