Researchers have found a gene mutation, which is a change in a gene, that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago and seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It is too early to say how much genes influence language, but one day, the answers might be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the use of the verb 'undergo' in the sentence 'Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.' 'Undergo' is listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate and is generally considered too advanced for a B1 reader. Additionally, while the definition of 'mutation' was helpful, the third sentence, 'Researchers have found a gene mutation, which is a change in a gene, that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago and seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces,' is quite long and complex for a B1 reader due to its multiple clauses and embedded information. To achieve a B1 level, consider replacing 'undergo' with a simpler phrase such as 'experience' or 'have'. For the longer sentence, it would be beneficial to split it into two or more shorter sentences to reduce the cognitive load for the reader. For example, 'Researchers found a gene mutation. This change in a gene happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. It seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces.' On a positive note, the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning, as indicated by the high MeaningBERT (0.9453) and BERTScore (0.9625) metrics. The addition of the definition for 'mutation' was also a good strategy for a B1 audience.",
