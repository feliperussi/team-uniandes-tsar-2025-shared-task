For example, it could be replaced with 'experience' or 'show' (e.g., 'it did not show this mutation').

While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well (MeaningBERT: 0.8642, BERTScore: 0.9405), the simplification strategy has resulted in a text that is too simple for the target B1 audience. This is primarily due to several factors: 1. Explicit Definitions: The text provides very explicit definitions for 'genes' ('Genes are small parts inside our bodies that carry information.'), 'mutation' ('A change in a gene is called a mutation.'), and 'DNA' ('DNA is the material in living things that carries information about them.'). While defining keywords is good practice, the explicitness and placement of these definitions, especially for 'genes', contribute to a lower CEFR level. 2. Vocabulary Simplification: Several B2-level words from the original text were replaced with A1/A2 synonyms. For example, 'mutated' was changed to 'changed', 'occurred' to 'happened', 'connection' to 'link', and 'undergo' to 'show'. These choices, while making the text very accessible, collectively reduce the linguistic complexity below B1. 3. Sentence Structure: The original sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.' was split into three simpler sentences in the output. To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating definitions more subtly or using slightly more sophisticated B1-level synonyms where appropriate.

This is primarily due to the continued use of B2 vocabulary and complex sentence structures. Specifically, the word 'undergo' is classified as B2. A simpler alternative like 'experience' or 'have' would be more appropriate for B1. Additionally, several sentences remain long and contain multiple clauses, making them challenging for a B1 reader. For example, 'This mutation occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and it seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.' This sentence could be split into two or simplified. The use of complex noun clauses, such as 'how genes influence brain and language development' and 'how our brains control our mouths and face', also contributes to the B2 classification. While the definitions for 'mutation' and 'DNA' are excellent additions for B1 comprehension, the overall linguistic complexity of the text needs further simplification to meet the B1 target. Suggestion: Review the vocabulary candidates, especially B2 words, and simplify sentence structures by breaking down long sentences and rephrasing complex clauses.",

While the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning, the simplification strategy resulted in an output that is below the desired complexity. For example, the phrase 'special parts of our bodies, called genes' is an overly simplistic explanation for 'genetics' or 'genes'. Similarly, defining 'mutation' as 'a change in a gene, which is called a mutation' and 'DNA' as 'the material in living things that carries information about them' uses very basic language and sentence structures more appropriate for A2. The overall sentence structure is also quite simple, lacking the more complex sentence constructions and varied vocabulary expected at a B1 level. To achieve a B1 level, consider integrating the definitions more smoothly or using slightly more sophisticated phrasing for the definitions themselves, while still ensuring clarity. For instance, instead of 'special parts of our bodies, called genes,' you could aim for something like 'how genes, the basic units of heredity, influence...' or integrate the definition of mutation more naturally without breaking the flow into two very simple sentences. The goal is simplification to B1, not A2.",

This is primarily due to the use of the verb 'undergo' in the sentence 'Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.' 'Undergo' is listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate and is generally considered too advanced for a B1 reader. Additionally, while the definition of 'mutation' was helpful, the third sentence, 'Researchers have found a gene mutation, which is a change in a gene, that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago and seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces,' is quite long and complex for a B1 reader due to its multiple clauses and embedded information. To achieve a B1 level, consider replacing 'undergo' with a simpler phrase such as 'experience' or 'have'. For the longer sentence, it would be beneficial to split it into two or more shorter sentences to reduce the cognitive load for the reader. For example, 'Researchers found a gene mutation. This change in a gene happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. It seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces.' On a positive note, the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning, as indicated by the high MeaningBERT (0.9453) and BERTScore (0.9625) metrics.
