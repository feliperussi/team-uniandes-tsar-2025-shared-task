They find answers and make decisions together. Leaders are like coaches. They want workers to think for themselves. They think it is good when workers question their ideas.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text is a model of A2 compliance.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. No discrepancies were found.\n- Metrics Compliance: MeaningBERT score (0.78) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds of 0.75 and 0.90 respectively. This confirms excellent preservation of the core message and key phrasing.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classifies as A2, meeting the primary requirement.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, with no B1 or higher terms present. Sentence structures are simple and short, using only basic connectors such as 'and' and 'but'. The simplification of concepts like 'subordinates' to 'workers' and 'encourage independent thought' to 'want workers to think for themselves' is an exemplary execution of A2 simplification principles. The text meets all standards without deviation.",
