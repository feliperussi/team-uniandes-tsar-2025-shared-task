    "text_translated": "Now NASA is working to find some of the smaller asteroids, which are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, they have only found about 8,000. This means there are still 17,000 that we do not know about. In 2013, a much smaller 19-metre asteroid exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia and injured 1,200 people. For this reason, these middle-sized asteroids are a serious danger if they enter the area around Earth.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. The primary reason for this is likely the use of the B2-level word 'means' in the sentence: 'This means there are still 17,000 that we do not know about.' To correct this and meet the B1 requirement, replace 'This means' with a simpler B1-level connector. For example, rephrase the sentence to 'So, there are still 17,000 that we do not know about.' The submission successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with high scores for both MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.95). The simplification of complex concepts was otherwise effective.",
