While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning, it is too simple for the required level. The original complex sentences were broken down into too many short, simple sentences, such as 'It injured 1,200 people.' This results in a choppy text that lacks the grammatical complexity expected at B1. To improve, combine some of the shorter sentences using B1-level connectors. For example, instead of two separate sentences about the Chelyabinsk event, try: 'In 2013, when a much smaller 19-metre asteroid exploded above Chelyabinsk in Russia, it injured 1,200 people.' This introduces a subordinate clause, raising the complexity to the target B1 level.",

This failure is due to overly complex sentence structures, even though the vocabulary is simple. For example, the sentence 'Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but since they have only found about 8,000 so far, there are still 17,000 that we do not know about' combines multiple clauses and is too long for a B1 reader. Suggestion: Break complex sentences into shorter, more direct statements. For instance: 'Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, they have only found about 8,000. This means there are still 17,000 that we do not know about.' Despite this issue, the submission is excellent in all other areas.
