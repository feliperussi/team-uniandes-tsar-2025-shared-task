Your text changes this to a general statement about present actions (e.g., 'engineers build'), which fundamentally alters the core message from a specific analysis to a general explanation.

The sentence 'This can happen because workers used bad material when they built the bridge' contains two subordinate clauses ('because' and 'when'), a structure too complex for the A2 level. The clause 'nobody knows why' is also a B1 structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'used' was included in the output. This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The text relies on subordinating conjunctions like 'after', 'when', and 'because' to create multi-clause sentences. A2 texts must use short, simple sentences connected primarily by 'and', 'but', or 'so'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the entire text to focus on past events, mirroring the original's intent.

Your replacement, 'engineers do not know why at first' and they do a 'study', is too weak. It fails to communicate the difficulty and formality of the engineering process.\n- The original term 'defect in a key piece' implies a flaw in manufacturing or design. Your phrase 'a very important part of the bridge was broken' is less precise. 'Broken' could mean it broke from use, which is a different meaning than a 'defect'.\n- While the BERTScore is acceptable, the low MeaningBERT score confirms that the nuance and specific technical implications of the original text were oversimplified to the point of meaning loss.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Replace 'study' with a phrase that implies a more serious process, such as 'after they check everything very carefully'.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The introduction of irrelevant sentences ('Engineers are people. They build bridges.') severely disrupts the logical flow and dilutes the original meaning. These sentences do not exist in the source text and damage the coherence.\n- The sentence structure is excessively fragmented. This choppiness breaks the logical link between the problem (a mysterious collapse) and the solution (engineers investigating), which was a key relationship in the original text.\n- The text uses the B1-level word 'mystery'. A2-level texts must strictly use A2 vocabulary. This word should have been replaced with a simpler concept.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the irrelevant sentences. Reconnect the ideas to improve logical flow. Replace the B1 word 'mystery'. Rephrase to state: 'Sometimes engineers do not know why a bridge falls down. They study the bridge to find the reason.'"

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\nThe primary deviation is meaning. The original text's concepts of 'mysteries' and 'complete investigation' were simplified to 'do not know' and 'study'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the intended meaning of a difficult, in-depth process.\n\nA secondary deviation is CEFR compliance. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. The sentence 'Sometimes engineers do not know why a bridge falls down' uses a subordinate 'why' clause, which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. The idea of a 'mystery' is central. Rephrase the first sentence to eliminate the B1 clause. Example: 'Sometimes a bridge falls down. It is a mystery. Engineers must study it to find the reason.'"

It adheres to all protocol requirements without deviation.\n- Factual Integrity: The text is 100% factually accurate compared to the original.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.82 and BERTScore of 0.92 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly A2. B1 concepts like 'inferior-quality' and 'defect' were correctly simplified to 'bad' and 'problem'. Sentence structures are simple, short, and use only approved A2 connectors. The original complex sentence was successfully broken down into multiple simple sentences. No errors detected."

All key points regarding bridge collapse investigations are preserved.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.82 and BERTScore of 0.92 are excellent, confirming that the core message and key terms were successfully retained.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classifies as A2, demonstrating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The simplification of 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad materials' and 'defect' to 'problem' is exemplary.\n- Sentence Structure: The text uses short, simple sentences and basic connectors ('because', 'or', 'and'), which is ideal for the A2 level. The original text's complex structures were effectively simplified. This output is a model of A2 compliance."
