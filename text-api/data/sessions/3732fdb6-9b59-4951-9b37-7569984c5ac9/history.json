Logging an object is not the same as saving it. This is a critical misrepresentation of the source material.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8686 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing the correct concept of 'logging' with the incorrect concept of 'saving'.\n- Factual Error Propagation: The error is repeated. The original says '50 left to log', but your text says 'About 50 more are not yet saved'. This is also incorrect.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the original meaning. Replace 'saved' with a simple A2 phrase that means 'logged', such as 'made a list of' or 'found and wrote down information about'. The sentence 'About 50 more are not yet saved' must be corrected to 'About 50 more are not yet on the list'.",

While the simplification to A2 is structurally sound, it has been achieved by removing too much specific terminology, which damages the text's fidelity to the source. For example, the specific term 'planetary defence team' was replaced with the generic 'a team that protects the Earth'. The actions 'identified and logged' were reduced to 'found' and 'wrote down', losing lexical precision. Suggestion: Reintroduce more specific A2-level vocabulary to increase fidelity. The phrase 'NASA's team to protect the planet' is more precise. The concept of 'logging' can be expressed as 'made a list of' to retain more of the original meaning while remaining simple.",
