    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8712 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The simplification of key terms like 'planetary defence team' to 'a team to protect the planet' and 'identified and logged' to 'found' and 'made a list' has excessively reduced lexical overlap with the source.\n- The output is a series of short, disconnected sentences. This structure fails to capture the narrative flow of the original text, further contributing to the low fidelity score.\n- While the facts are preserved, the text reads like a simple list rather than a cohesive summary.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce more precise A2-level vocabulary to increase fidelity. Combine some of the short sentences to improve readability and flow. For example, use 'NASA's team for planetary defence' to retain the original concept. Combine the sentences about finding and listing the asteroids to create a more natural connection.",
