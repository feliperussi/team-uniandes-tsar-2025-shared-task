You think: \"Is this the good talk she has to say first?\" You think: \"Is she going to say her real message next?\" This way of talking is like a sandwich. First, people say good things.

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards. It maintains factual integrity and preserves the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7546 and a BERTScore of 0.9029. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2, with complex terms like 'manager' simplified to 'boss' and 'obligatory praise' explained in simple terms. The concept of 'feedback sandwich' is clearly explained without using the B1 word 'feedback'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using direct speech effectively to convey internal thoughts. No deviations from the A2 standard were found.",
