        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The simplification introduces a significant factual error that changes the outcome of the events described. The original text states the team communicated their perspective: '...and were able to explain that it was how they'd always worked.' The output changes this action into an internal feeling: '...and they felt this was how they had always worked.' This is incorrect. By removing the act of 'explaining', the output fails to convey that the team communicated their working style to Gabriela, which is a critical point in the original narrative. To correct this, the sentence should be revised to reflect the act of communication, for example: '...and they explained that this was how they had always worked.'",

The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) are excellent, indicating strong preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are very effective: complex concepts like 'leadership' were skillfully simplified to 'being the boss', and the phrase 'challenge or make changes to her decisions' was concisely reduced to 'question her decisions'. Sentence structure is clear and direct, improving flow and readability for the target audience. This is a strong example of a successful B1 simplification.",
