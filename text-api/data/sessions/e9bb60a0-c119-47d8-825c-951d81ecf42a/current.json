The team was happy to be asked, and they openly said they were not used to being told exactly what to do. They liked having more space for taking their own initiative and for being creative. When Gabriela told them exactly what she needed, they felt she did not trust them to do their job well. They also realized that Gabriela took it personally when they tried to question her decisions, and they explained that this was how they had always worked.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) are excellent, indicating strong preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are very effective: complex concepts like 'leadership' were skillfully simplified to 'being the boss', and the phrase 'challenge or make changes to her decisions' was concisely reduced to 'question her decisions'. Sentence structure is clear and direct, improving flow and readability for the target audience. This is a strong example of a successful B1 simplification.",
