    "grade": 6,
    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', likely because of non-defining relative clauses and sentence structures above B1 level. For example, the sentence \"Now NASA wants to record some of the smaller asteroids, which are 140 metres wide or more.\" uses a non-defining relative clause that is too advanced for B1. Also, \"So far, NASA has recorded around 8,000, so 17,000 are not yet recorded.\" joins two independent clauses with a comma and coordinating conjunction, which can be confusing at B1. To meet B1 level, split complex sentences. For instance: \"Now NASA wants to record the smaller asteroids. They measure at least 140 metres wide.\" And: \"So far, NASA has recorded around 8,000. That leaves 17,000 not yet recorded.\" This will simplify structures and ensure a B1 classification.",
