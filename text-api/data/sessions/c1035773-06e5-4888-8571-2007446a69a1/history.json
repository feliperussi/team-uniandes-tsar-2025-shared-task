Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: The definition of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is oversimplified. The original text specifies these rocks are 'close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your version states 'They are less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth's path'. This loses the crucial nuance of 'passing within' the orbit, which is central to the definition of a PHA. Deviation: The concept of 'threat' is diminished. The original text states 'none of which are expected to be a threat'. Your version simplifies this to 'NASA thinks they will not hit Earth'. 'Threat' is a broader concept than just direct impact, and this simplification loses part of the original meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' to clearly state their proximity to and interaction with Earth's orbit, not just their distance.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6324 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message. Additionally, the CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, failing the A2 compliance requirement.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT): The definition of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is fragmented. The original text defines them as 'rocks close enough to pass within...', but your version separates this into two distinct sentences ('They come close to Earth. They pass within...'), losing the direct definitional link.\n2.  Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT): The nuance of 'none of which are expected to be a threat' is lost. Your version states 'They will not be a danger' as a definitive fact, removing the element of expectation or prediction.\n3.  Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT): The conditional relationship between predicting an impact and launching defence solutions is weakened. The original's 'at which point two defence solutions could be launched' implies a direct consequence of prediction. Your 'If a rock comes, NASA can launch two ways to stop it' is less precise and changes 'could be launched' (possibility) to 'can launch' (ability), altering the original meaning.\n4.  CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The word 'Potentially' is a B2-level word. Even as part of a proper noun, its presence contributes to the text's complexity beyond A2.\n5.  CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The word 'within' is a B1-level word.\n6.  CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The word 'launch' is a B1-level word.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Rephrase the initial sentence to clearly state that 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are defined by their proximity to Earth's path, rather than separating the ideas.\n*   Restore the concept of 'expectation' or 'prediction' when discussing the threat level of the asteroids.\n*   Clarify the direct conditional link between NASA's ability to predict an impact and the subsequent deployment of defence solutions.\n*   Replace 'Potentially' with simpler A2 vocabulary, such as 'possibly dangerous' or 'sometimes dangerous'.\n*   Replace 'within' with simpler A2 phrasing, such as 'less than' or 'inside'.\n*   Replace 'launch' with simpler A2 vocabulary, such as 'send out' or 'use'.",

The primary reason for this failure is the inclusion of vocabulary above the A2 level. The phrase 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' contains the word 'Potentially', which is explicitly identified as a B2 word in the provided vocabulary analysis. For an A2 text, this term must be simplified or defined using only A2 vocabulary. The writer failed to identify this as a keyword needing simplification and used the B2 word directly. Suggestion: Rephrase 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' using only A2 words, for example, 'Dangerous Space Rocks' or 'Rocks that can be a danger'.",

The CEFR classifier result of A2 is irrelevant given the higher priority failure. Specific deviations are listed below. \n*   The original text introduces a specific category: 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. Your version simplifies this to 'Some rocks can be a danger', which loses the specific classification and the nuance of 'potentially hazardous'. This is a critical loss of information. \n*   The original text refers to 'two defence solutions'. Your version states 'NASA can send two things to stop it', which is too vague and loses the specific concept of 'defence solutions' as a strategic, planned response. \n*   Suggestion: Reintroduce the concept of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' in a simplified A2 manner, for example, 'These are special dangerous rocks'. \n*   Suggestion: Rephrase 'two things to stop it' to convey the idea of 'two plans to protect Earth' or 'two ways to stop it' to better reflect 'defence solutions'.",

The original states 'none of which are expected to be a threat', conveying a scientific expectation. Your version 'NASA thinks they will not be a danger' introduces a subjective 'thinks' which reduces the certainty. Furthermore, 'two defence solutions could be launched' in the original implies active intervention, which is lost in your 'NASA has two plans. These plans can protect Earth.' which only states the existence of plans. Suggestion: Rephrase the definition to clearly state what PHAs are based on their proximity. Ensure the certainty of NASA's assessment is maintained. Rephrase the defence aspect to include the concept of launching or activating solutions.",
