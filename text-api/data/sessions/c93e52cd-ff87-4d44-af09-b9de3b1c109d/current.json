    "text_translated": "If most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten, that's as many as 2,000 dreams per year. So, by the time they reach 80 years old, the average person might have had as many as 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95-99 percent of our dreams, that's still a few thousand remembered dreams across a lifetime. It's not too difficult to believe that, by coincidence, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed the Factual Integrity Check, as there were no discrepancies between the original and the writer's output. Meaning and Fidelity were also preserved, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and a BERTScore of 0.9933, both well above the required thresholds. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. However, the writer's output is almost identical to the original text. While this means it maintains the original's quality and CEFR level, it also indicates that no simplification was actually performed. The purpose of this task is text simplification, and the output does not demonstrate any effort to simplify the language, structure, or vocabulary. For future submissions, please ensure that simplification strategies are applied, especially considering the identified B2 vocabulary candidates like 'lifetime' and 'coincidence' which were not addressed. The text is technically correct and meets the B1 target, but it does not show any simplification effort.",
