So, when a person gets to 80 years old, they might have had as many as 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget most of our dreams (about 95-99 percent), we still remember a few thousand of them during our lives. Because of this, it is not hard to believe that sometimes a dream can be similar to something that happens in real life by chance, especially if the dream is about something common that happens every day.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the required B1 level. The simplification has consistently opted for simpler grammatical structures and vocabulary, making the text less challenging than intended. For instance, the phrase 'by the time they reach' was simplified to 'when a person gets to', and the complex sentence 'It's not too difficult to believe that, by coincidence, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life' was broken down and rephrased using simpler connectors and sentence structures. While the meaning is preserved, the overall linguistic complexity has been reduced below the B1 threshold. To achieve a B1 level, the text should incorporate a greater variety of B1-level grammatical structures and vocabulary, such as more complex conjunctions, relative clauses, or conditional sentences, while maintaining clarity. For example, consider retaining phrases like 'by the time they reach' or using more varied B1 connectors beyond 'Because of this' to introduce clauses.",

Meaning and Fidelity were also preserved, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and a BERTScore of 0.9933, both well above the required thresholds. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. However, the writer's output is almost identical to the original text. While this means it maintains the original's quality and CEFR level, it also indicates that no simplification was actually performed. The purpose of this task is text simplification, and the output does not demonstrate any effort to simplify the language, structure, or vocabulary. For future submissions, please ensure that simplification strategies are applied, especially considering the identified B2 vocabulary candidates like 'lifetime' and 'coincidence' which were not addressed. The text is technically correct and meets the B1 target, but it does not show any simplification effort.",
