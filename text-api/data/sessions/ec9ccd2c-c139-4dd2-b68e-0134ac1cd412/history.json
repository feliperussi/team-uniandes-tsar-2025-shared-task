While the simplification maintained factual integrity and meaning, the vocabulary and phrasing were consistently reduced to an A2 level. For example, 'parental leave' was simplified to 'time off to care for my children', 'negotiating with my boss' became 'talked with my manager', 'pro-rata basis' was explained as 'paid for the hours I work', and 'workload hasn't decreased in the slightest' became 'amount of work I have to do has not become smaller at all'. These changes, while clear, remove the opportunity for B1 learners to encounter and understand slightly more complex, yet common, vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. To achieve a B1 level, consider retaining some of the original B1-appropriate vocabulary or introducing synonyms that are at the B1 level, rather than always opting for the most explicit and simplest explanation. For instance, 'parental leave' is a B1 term that could be retained. 'Negotiating' could be simplified to 'discussing' or 'agreeing' rather than just 'talked'. 'Workload' is also a suitable B1 term. The explanation of 'pro-rata basis' is good, but the overall simplification of other terms pulls the text down.",

While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9453, BERTScore: 0.9703), it did not achieve the target CEFR level. This is primarily due to the retention of complex sentence structures and some vocabulary that exceeds the B1 threshold. For example, the first sentence, 'I used to work five days a week, but after I came out of my parental leave, I decided I wanted to spend more time with my children before they start school,' is quite long and contains multiple clauses, which can be challenging for a B1 learner. Additionally, the use of 'considerably reduced' (where 'considerably' is a B2 vocabulary candidate) and the idiom 'in the slightest' in the fourth sentence contribute to the B2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into two or more simpler sentences, replacing B2 vocabulary with more common B1 synonyms (e.g., 'much reduced' instead of 'considerably reduced'), and simplifying complex grammatical structures where possible.",
