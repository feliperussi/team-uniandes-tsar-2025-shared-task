After talking with my boss, we decided to cut my working week down to three days. Of course, my pay was much reduced, because my salary is calculated based on the hours I work. However, I have noticed that my workload hasn't decreased at all! I'm now doing five days' worth of work in three days, but getting paid much less for it!",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.904 and BERTScore of 0.9605 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. Complex phrases like 'parental leave' were clearly explained as 'leave to have a child', 'negotiating' was simplified to 'talking', and 'pro-rata basis' was accurately rephrased as 'my salary is calculated based on the hours I work'. The use of B1 connectors such as 'But', 'Of course', and 'However' enhances readability and flow. Sentence structures were appropriately adjusted without losing the original nuance. This is an exemplary simplification that meets all requirements.",
