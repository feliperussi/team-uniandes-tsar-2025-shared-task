      "content": "Text saved: Some bridge collapses are mysteries, which means engineers do not understand the reasons at first, but they realise them after a full investigation. Engineers are people who design and build structures like bridges. An investigation is when they study carefully to find out what happened. Sometimes, the problem is that bad-quality material, which means the things used to build the bridge, was used during construction, or there was a defect, which is a fault or problem, in an important part of the bridge. Material means the substance or things used to make something, and construction is the process of building it. In other cases, the bridge was made to support, which means to hold up, only a certain amount of weight. Weight is how heavy something is, and if too much weight is on the bridge, it can collapse.",
