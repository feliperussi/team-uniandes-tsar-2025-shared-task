A stereotype is a simple idea about a group of people, and this idea is often not true. It is good to know that people can have different ideas and act in different ways. This helps us understand each other better. But it is very important to remember that stereotypes are bad. They are not good for making good business connections. A country's culture can change how we think and act. But many other things also change us. For example, the place we come from, the people we are with, our age, and our job. Our life experiences are also important. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we should not use this to think that all people from one country are the same.",
