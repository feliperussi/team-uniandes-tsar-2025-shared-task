    "text_translated": "Culture is the way people in a country or group live. It is their ideas and their way of doing things. A stereotype is a simple idea about a group of people, and this idea is often not true. It is good to know that people can have different ideas and act in different ways. This helps us understand each other better. But it is very important to remember that stereotypes are bad. They are not good for working well with people in business. A country's culture can change how we think and act. But many other things also change us. For example, the place we come from, the people we are with, our age, our gender, and our job are also important. The things that happen in our life are also important. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we should not use this to think that all people from one country are the same.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It correctly identifies and defines the key terms 'culture' and 'stereotype' in simple A2 language at the beginning of the text. All sentence structures are simple and declarative. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, successfully simplifying complex concepts from the original text. No corrections are necessary.",
