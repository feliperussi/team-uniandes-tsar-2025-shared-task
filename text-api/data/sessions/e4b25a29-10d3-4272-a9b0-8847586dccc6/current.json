    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6627 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is an instant failure.\n\n- Primary Error: The original text's core concept that the games are a 'punishment for rebelling' was completely lost. Your version, 'to make the areas obey', changes the reason for the event and is a critical deviation from the source material.\n- Secondary Meaning Error: The original states the nation is 'forced to watch'. Your version, 'watches the games', omits the crucial element of compulsion.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'annual' is B1 level. It must be replaced. You correctly used 'Each year' later in the text, but failed to apply this simplification to the first sentence.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'obey' is B2 level. It is too advanced for an A2 text and must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the second sentence to include the concept of 'punishment'. Rephrase the final sentence to include the concept of being 'forced'. Replace 'annual' with 'every year'. Replace 'obey' with an A2 phrase like 'follow the rules'.",
