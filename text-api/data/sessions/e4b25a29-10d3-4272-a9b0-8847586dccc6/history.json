This changes the meaning from a lack of choice to a simple obligation, failing to convey the Capitol's oppressive power.\n- Semantic Link Lost: The original states tributes are chosen 'to compete'. Your version separates these ideas into 'they pick a boy and a girl' and 'they must fight', breaking the direct cause-and-effect link.\n\nSuggestion: Restore critical vocabulary. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of meaning. The concept of being 'forced' is essential and must be conveyed more strongly than 'must'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the inability to preserve the original text's core meaning and lexical fidelity, as evidenced by the metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7145 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8872 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of meaning and key vocabulary.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text states the Capitol uses the games to 'remind the districts that they are being punished'. Your version states the Capitol 'uses the games to punish the areas'. This loses the crucial concept of the games being an annual, psychological reminder, not just the punishment itself.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing key nouns with overly simple alternatives. 'Districts' became 'areas', 'lottery' became 'draw', and 'battle' became 'match'. These substitutions reduce the text's precision and move it too far from the source.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'punish' and 'survive'. These words are not on the A2 list and must be simplified. Their inclusion is a direct violation of the CEFR A2 standard.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is broken into excessively short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure contributes to the loss of meaning by breaking the logical flow between ideas, such as the connection between rebellion and punishment.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the concept that the games are a 'reminder' of the punishment. Rephrase sentences to avoid the B1 words 'punish' and 'survive'. For example, 'Only one person can be the winner' or 'Only one person is living at the end'. Combine some of the short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'because' to create a more natural text.",

The core reason for the punishment, 'for rebelling', was completely removed. The concept of 'remind' was also lost, weakening the Capitol's motivation.\n\nAdditionally, the text fails the qualitative audit due to severe vocabulary violations.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words that are not on the A2 list. 'punish' (B1), 'district' (B1), 'lottery' (B1), 'nation' (B1), and 'tribute' (C1) are all too advanced for this level. These words make the text inaccessible to an A2 reader without definitions.\n- Factual Simplification Error: The original states the Capitol uses the games to 'remind' the districts of their punishment. Your version states the games 'punish' the districts. This is a subtle but important change in meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The text must state that the punishment is for a past rebellion. All words above the A2 level must be replaced or defined. 'Tributes' must be explained as 'the teenagers who are chosen to fight'. 'Districts' must be explained as 'the different parts of the country'.",
