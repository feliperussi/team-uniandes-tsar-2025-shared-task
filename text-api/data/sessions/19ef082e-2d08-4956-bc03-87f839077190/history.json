        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text introduces the C1 level word 'diplomat'. According to the rules, the introduction of complex terms, even if they are explained, is an immediate failure. The goal is to use vocabulary the learner already knows, not to teach new words. The sentence should have been rewritten to convey the meaning without using the advanced vocabulary. For example: 'Martel's father worked for his country in other countries.' This single violation is critical and makes the text unacceptable."

The replacement of the C1 word 'diplomat' with the A2-level explanation 'worked for his country in other countries' is an exemplary execution of the task's requirements. No corrections are needed."
