    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. The concept of dreams being coincidence rather than prophecy is perfectly preserved in simple terms.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well above the required thresholds. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9 and BERTScore of 0.9269 indicate excellent preservation of meaning and lexical content.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids B1 complexity.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The sentence structure is exemplary, breaking down a complex idea into short, simple, and clear sentences connected by basic conjunctions. No deviations were found.",
