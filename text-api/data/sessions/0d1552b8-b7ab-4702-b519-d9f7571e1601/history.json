This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text deviates too far from the source's lexical structure. While simplification is the objective, it must not come at the cost of fidelity. Key phrases like 'result of coincidence' and 'prophecy' were replaced entirely, causing the score to drop below the threshold.\n\n- Secondary Observation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7599 is borderline, barely meeting the 0.75 minimum. This confirms that while the general idea is present, the nuance is being lost.\n\n- Structural Compliance: The text does adhere to A2 standards in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. All sentences are simple and the vocabulary is restricted to A1/A2 levels. However, this does not compensate for the primary fidelity failure.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to increase lexical similarity to the original source. The goal is to simplify, not to completely rephrase. Retain key A2-level words from the original where possible to meet the fidelity requirement.",

While the sentence structure is appropriately simple and the simplification of 'prophecy' is correct, the vocabulary error is critical and non-negotiable. Suggestion: Replace 'It is probably just a coincidence' with an A2-compliant phrase. For example: 'It probably just happens by chance.' or 'The two things are probably not connected.'",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.9 and BERTScore of 0.9269 indicate excellent preservation of meaning and lexical content.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids B1 complexity.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The sentence structure is exemplary, breaking down a complex idea into short, simple, and clear sentences connected by basic conjunctions. No deviations were found.",
