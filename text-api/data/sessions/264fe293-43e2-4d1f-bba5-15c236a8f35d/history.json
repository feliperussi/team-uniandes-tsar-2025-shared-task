This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of specific meaning through oversimplification. The original text describes a conflict. Your version reduces this to a list of facts.\n- The word 'aggressive' was replaced with 'mean'. 'Aggressive' describes a specific, dangerous behavior. 'Mean' is a general, childish term that does not convey the same level of threat.\n- The phrase 'don't welcome their presence' was replaced with 'do not like them'. The original phrase explains that residents have a problem with the animals being in their area. Your version only describes a simple feeling, which is a weaker and less accurate representation of the situation.\n- The extreme simplification into very short, disconnected sentences breaks the cause-and-effect logic present in the original text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase to show the baboons are a direct problem for residents. Use A2 words that are more precise. For example, change 'Baboons can be mean' to 'Baboons can be dangerous'. Change 'many city people do not like them' to 'many city people are not happy that the baboons are there'.",

You must only simplify the provided text, not add new facts.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'aggressive' is B1 level. It was not simplified to an A2 equivalent.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The phrase 'on the edge of the city' uses the B1 word 'edge'. This was not simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the primary factual error. The text must state that baboons 'go into areas where people live'. Remove the sentence 'Baboons are large monkeys'. Replace 'aggressive' with an A2 phrase like 'can be angry and fight'. Rephrase 'on the edge of the city' to 'in the parts of the city that are near the countryside'.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary error is the translation of the concept 'aggressive'. Your phrase 'can be angry and fight' is not an accurate A2 equivalent. 'Aggressive' describes a consistent behavioral trait, while 'angry and fight' describes a temporary emotional state and action. This semantic shift is unacceptable and is the main reason for the low meaning score.\n- The phrase 'many city residents do not want baboons' is an oversimplification of 'many city residents don't welcome their presence'. The original implies a reaction to the animals being in their space, while your version is a more simplistic statement of dislike. This also contributes to the loss of meaning.\n- The text is structurally simple and uses A2 vocabulary correctly, but this does not compensate for the failure to maintain the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning with A2-compliant language. Rephrase 'Baboons can be angry and fight' to 'Baboons can be dangerous and sometimes they attack'. Rephrase 'many city residents do not want baboons' to 'many people in the city are not happy about the baboons'.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nThe primary failure is over-simplification.

Your version separates this into three sentences, weakening the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe phrase 'don't welcome their presence' has a specific meaning that was lost when replaced with the more general 'are not happy'. The original implies a desire for the animals to leave; your version is a simple statement of emotion.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine sentences to restore the logical flow.
