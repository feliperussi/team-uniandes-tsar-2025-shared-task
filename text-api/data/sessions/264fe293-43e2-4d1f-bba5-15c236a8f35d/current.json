    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6993 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Meaning Loss: The original text states 'so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence.' Your version, 'So many city residents do not want them there,' loses the critical concept of 'understandably'. This removes the logical connection that the residents' feelings are a direct and reasonable result of the baboons' dangerous behavior.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'edge' was used in the sentence '...near the city edge.' This word is above the A2 level and must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the final sentence to show *why* residents do not want baboons there. Example: 'Because baboons can be dangerous, people do not want them there.' Suggestion: Replace the word 'edge' with an A2 alternative like 'end' or 'side'.",
