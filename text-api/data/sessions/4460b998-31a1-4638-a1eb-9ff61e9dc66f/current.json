    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets the CEFR A2 readability standard. It maintains factual integrity, as confirmed by manual verification. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7946 exceeds the 0.75 threshold, indicating strong preservation of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.9332 surpasses the 0.90 requirement, demonstrating excellent lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the output as A2. The vocabulary used is appropriate for the A2 level, with complex terms from the original text simplified effectively (e.g., 'raise awareness about a range of environmental issues' to 'help people understand problems with nature'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, utilizing A2-appropriate connectors such as 'or', 'but', and 'who'. The breakdown of longer sentences into multiple shorter ones significantly aids A2 comprehension. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
