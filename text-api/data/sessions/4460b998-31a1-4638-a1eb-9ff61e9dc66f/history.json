The core message and specific nuances of the original text have been lost or severely diluted. Specific deviations: - The phrase 'help raise awareness about a range of environmental issues' was simplified to 'help nature. They show people problems with nature'. This loses the crucial concept of 'awareness' and the scope of 'a range of environmental issues', reducing the original meaning to a vague and less impactful statement. - The phrase 'keen to help people in need and raise money for charities' was simplified to 'want to help people. They get money for good groups'. This removes the specific detail of 'people in need' and replaces the precise term 'charities' with the generic 'good groups', diminishing the fidelity of the original message. - The term 'satellite phones' was simplified to 'special phones'. While 'special' is not incorrect, 'satellite' is a specific and important detail that should be retained or explained simply, not just replaced with a generic adjective. - The term 'continents' was simplified to 'big lands'. While 'big lands' is understandable, 'continents' is a common A2-level word that should have been used to maintain lexical fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase the sections concerning environmental issues and charity work to more accurately reflect the original meaning while maintaining A2 simplicity. Ensure key specific terms like 'satellite phones' and 'charities' are either used or explained with equivalent A2 vocabulary that preserves their specific meaning.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuance, despite efforts to simplify. Specific instances of meaning dilution include: The original 'thousands of people' was reduced to 'many people', losing the sense of scale. 'The world's highest mountains' was simplified to 'very high mountains', losing specificity and magnitude. The explicit comparison 'Unlike the explorers of the past' was removed, weakening the contrast between old and new methods. 'Modern technology' was generalized to 'new tools', losing the specific concept of 'technology'. 'Raise awareness about a range of environmental issues' was simplified to 'help nature. They want people to know about many problems with nature.', which, while conveying the general idea, loses the active and specific concept of 'raising awareness'. 'Keen to help people in need' was weakened to 'want to help people who need help', losing the intensity of 'keen'. 'Raise money for charities' was simplified to 'get money for charities', losing the active effort implied by 'raise'. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific meaning and magnitude of the original text while still using A2 vocabulary and structures. For example, instead of 'many people', consider 'a lot of people' or 'very many people' if 'thousands' is too complex. Ensure key concepts like 'raise awareness' are conveyed with equivalent A2 phrasing that retains the active meaning.",
