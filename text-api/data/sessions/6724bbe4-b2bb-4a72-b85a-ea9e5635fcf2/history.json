Many big supermarket chains have been criticised in the last ten years because they have wasted large amounts of food, paid too little to the people who supply them, and used too much plastic in their packaging, which has hurt the environment. However, supermarkets and shops that sell groceries have started to pay attention. Because customers are unhappy about the large amounts of plastic waste from packaging, some of the biggest supermarkets in the UK have agreed to work together to change packaging and reduce plastic waste.",

        "feedback_text": "The output passes the critical checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, fidelity, and CEFR compliance. There are no factual errors between the original and output; the key details about supermarket unethical acts, plastic waste impact, and the UK supermarkets' pledge are preserved accurately. The MeaningBERT score of 0.751 and BERTScore of 0.9163 meet the thresholds, indicating good preservation of core message and lexical content. The CEFR classifier result of B1 is appropriate and consistent with the controlled vocabulary and relatively simple sentence structures used. The text uses effective B1-level connectors such as 'however' and 'because' that help the flow without overcomplicating. The keywords 'supermarket' and 'packaging' are clearly defined at the start, aiding comprehension. Vocabulary candidates mostly conform to B1-level language, and no overly complex terms remain, supporting the CEFR result. To improve, the output could increase sentence variety and use more B1 connective phrases to enhance fluency. Also, minor rephrasing of long sentences into two shorter ones could improve readability while maintaining simplicity. Overall, this is a well-executed simplification appropriate for B1 readers.",
