    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets the CEFR A2 readability standard. It passed all diagnostic checks. The factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning and lexical fidelity are preserved, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.8705 and BERTScore of 0.9214. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms appropriate vocabulary and simplified sentence structures. Complex sentences from the original text have been effectively broken down into short, clear A2-level sentences. The use of connectors is limited to 'But', which is suitable for A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A2 range.",
