The MeaningBERT score of 0.8705 and BERTScore of 0.9214 are well within the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is appropriate for A2, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using basic connectors like 'But', which is ideal for the A2 level. This is a model example of A2 simplification.",
