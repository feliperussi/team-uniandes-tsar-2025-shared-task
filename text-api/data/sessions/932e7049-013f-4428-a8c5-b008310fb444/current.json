    "text_translated": "We suggest that Girox Foods should change how it manages people. Managers should focus more on their workers. The company should let workers choose when they start and finish work. It should also let them work from places they choose, like their home. Managers need to give their staff new and interesting tasks. They should also show workers they did a good job and give rewards for good work. The company should spend more money on training. This training can help workers understand and talk with people from different countries and cultures. This will make the company a good place to work. Then, all workers can do their best work.",
