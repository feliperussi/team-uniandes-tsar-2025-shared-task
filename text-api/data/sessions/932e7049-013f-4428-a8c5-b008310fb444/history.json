This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The original text presents a formal business recommendation based on 'findings'. Your output, starting with 'Because of what we found', oversimplifies this to a casual suggestion, losing the professional weight and context.\n- The concept of a 'people-oriented management style' was reduced to 'care more about its people'. This simplification loses the specific business management concept.\n- The phrase 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was reduced to 'say good job'. While simple, this loses the formal meaning of recognizing and rewarding work in a structured way.\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with A2, the overall simplification has resulted in a text that does not carry the same professional intent as the original. The fidelity to the source's meaning is insufficient.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the formal tone of a recommendation. Rephrase the opening to reflect that the suggestions are based on specific findings, for example: 'Our report shows that Girox Foods needs a new plan.' The core message must be preserved with higher fidelity."

This indicates the core message was not adequately preserved. The BERTScore of 0.8997 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification was caused by overly complex sentence structures.\n- B1 Sentence Structure Detected: The sentence 'The company needs a new way to manage its people that focuses more on the workers' uses a relative clause ('that focuses...'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is unacceptable for A2.\n- B1 Sentence Structure Detected: The sentence 'Training for how to talk with people from different places is very important' uses a long and complex noun phrase as the subject. This elevates the complexity beyond the A2 level.\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text's concept of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was simplified to 'show they see the good work employees do and give positive comments'. This loses the formal, systematic meaning of reinforcement.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to eliminate all B1 structures. Break complex sentences into multiple simple A2 sentences. The sentence with the relative clause must be split. Example: 'The company needs a new way to manage people. This new way must focus more on workers.' Simplify the long noun phrase. Example: 'Training is very important. Employees need training on how to talk with people from different places.'"

This is a critical shift in meaning.\n- Nuance Loss: The phrase 'positive reinforcement and recognition' has a specific professional meaning. Your simplification to 'tell staff they are doing a good job and thank them' loses this professional nuance, contributing to the low meaning score.\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases from the original like 'people-oriented management style' and 'professional development' were oversimplified, causing a drop in lexical fidelity as measured by BERTScore.\n- Structural Simplification: While the text correctly uses A2 sentence structures and vocabulary, the simplification was too aggressive, resulting in the unacceptable loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to preserve the original's intent as a recommendation. The simplification must not remove the core purpose of the source text. Restore the concept that these are suggestions for improvement, not just a list of needs.

They should also give 'recognition'. This means showing everyone that a worker did something well. The company should make an 'investment' in 'professional development'. This means spending money to help workers learn new skills for their job. This training can help them talk with other people and with people from other countries. This will create a positive feeling at work. When workers feel good, they can do their best work.",

The original text is a formal recommendation; your output reads like a simple explanation for a child, which completely changes the meaning and intent. The BERTScore of 0.887 also fails the 0.90 fidelity requirement, indicating a loss of key professional terms.\n\nSecondary Failures:\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure. The text is too complex.\n- B1 Grammatical Structures: The text repeatedly uses structures above the A2 level. For example, 'This is a way of managing that focuses on helping workers' uses a relative clause. 'This means showing everyone that a worker did something well' uses a that-clause. 'This means spending money to help workers' uses a gerund as an object. These are all B1 structures.\n- B1/B2 Vocabulary Contamination: The text includes B1/B2 words such as 'management', 'development', 'flexible', 'recognition', and 'investment'. Defining a complex word is not a substitute for replacing it with a simple A2 equivalent. The task is to write at an A2 level, not to teach B1 vocabulary.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the entire text. Focus on the core actions, not the abstract concepts.\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'management style' with 'how bosses act'. Replace 'professional development' with 'job training'.\n- Suggestion: Destroy all complex sentences. Use only simple sentences with connectors like 'and', 'but', or 'so'. Instead of 'This means workers can choose when they work', write 'Workers can choose their hours. For example, they can start early or finish late.'"

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and professional context. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.88, which is below the minimum fidelity requirement of 0.90.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5511 demonstrates that your simplification has fundamentally altered the text's meaning. The original text discusses specific business concepts. Your version reduces them to overly simplistic actions, losing all professional nuance. For example, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is a complex strategy; 'change how its bosses act' is a vague and inadequate replacement.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8874 is too low. This is a direct result of replacing every key term from the source text. Terms like 'positive reinforcement', 'professional development', and 'intercultural communication' were replaced, not simplified. This damages the fidelity to the original information.\n\n- Conceptual Inaccuracy: The phrase 'talk with different people' is a critically poor substitute for the business concept of 'social and intercultural communication'. This is not a simplification; it is an incorrect translation of the concept.\n\n- Oversimplification: 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' is a formal system of encouragement. Reducing this to 'tell workers \"good job\"' loses the meaning of systematic, structured recognition.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the text. Do not replace every key concept. Instead, use simple A2 language to explain the existing concepts. The goal is to simplify the language around the core ideas, not to eliminate the core ideas themselves. Adhere more closely to the original's key vocabulary while simplifying the sentence structure."

The original text presents recommendations that 'contribute to creating a positive environment'. Your version turns this into a simple list of commands, losing the crucial meaning of cause and effect.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original links investment in 'social and intercultural communication' directly to creating a 'positive environment'. Your text separates these ideas into 'learn new skills' and 'work well with others', which weakens this core connection. The nuance of 'could contribute' is lost.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: Although the classifier rated the text A2, it contains B1 structures. The sentence 'We recommend that Girox Foods changes...' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 construction. The phrase 'a place they choose' is a reduced relative clause, also too complex for A2.\n- Fidelity: The BERTScore of 0.9022 is acceptable, but this does not compensate for the severe loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the connection between the recommended training and the goal of a better work environment. Rephrase the sentence 'We recommend that...' to avoid the 'that-clause'. Example: 'We think Girox Foods should change...'. Simplify the phrase 'a place they choose'.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text makes a formal 'recommendation' based on 'findings', but your version reduces this to 'Our study says', which loses the professional weight and meaning. Furthermore, the BERTScore of 0.8993 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90, indicating a loss of key lexical details.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: Score of 0.6626 is unacceptable. The concept of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was oversimplified to 'tell workers they are doing good work', which is not an equivalent meaning. The former is a systematic management strategy; the latter is a simple, informal action.\n- BERTScore Failure: Score of 0.8993 is a marginal fail. Key phrases from the original were lost in the simplification process.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 words 'management' and 'development' were retained in the final text. All vocabulary must conform to the A2 level. These words are too advanced and constitute a failure of the qualitative audit.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the entire text. You must find A2-level phrasing to convey the concept of a formal 'recommendation'. You must replace the B1 words 'management' and 'development'. The explanation for 'professional development' is a good start, but the B1 term itself should not be used. The concept of 'positive reinforcement' must be re-written to better capture its meaning as a consistent practice, not just a one-time comment."

For example, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' is a specific business strategy; 'think more about its workers' is a vague, general statement that fails to capture this meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: Key lexical items from the original were replaced with terms that are too general, causing the BERTScore to fall below the minimum. The phrase 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was replaced with 'show they are happy with good work and give rewards'. While simpler, this loses the specific, formal concepts from the source text.\n\n- Structural Integrity: While the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, this is irrelevant due to the failure to preserve meaning. The sentence structure and vocabulary are appropriate for the A2 level, but the content is not a faithful simplification.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification must retain the core concepts of the original text, even when using simpler words. Re-evaluate each key phrase from the original. Instead of 'give staff interesting work', which is too simple for 'challenge our staff', use a phrase like 'give staff work that helps them grow'.

All vocabulary must be strictly within the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to better capture the original meaning using A2 vocabulary. Avoid the word 'recommendation'. Use a phrase like 'This report gives ideas to...'. To improve meaning, rephrase 'say good job' to something like 'Managers should tell workers they are doing good work and give rewards'. Rephrase 'pay for courses' to 'The company should help workers learn new skills for their jobs'. This will improve the meaning and fidelity scores."

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and tone.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text is a formal business recommendation. Your output simplifies this into a list of ideas, losing the professional weight and intent. The concept of 'investment in professional development' is not accurately represented by 'help workers learn new skills'. The meaning has been diluted beyond an acceptable level.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8897 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of oversimplifying key terminology. Phrases like 'people-oriented management style' and 'positive reinforcement and recognition' were replaced with words that do not carry the same specific meaning, causing a loss of lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: While the text correctly classifies as A2, this was achieved by sacrificing too much of the original message.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to better preserve the original meaning while maintaining A2 simplicity. Restore the concept of a formal recommendation. To improve fidelity, use more precise A2 phrasing. For example, 'The company should pay for workers to learn new skills' is a more accurate A2 representation of 'investment in professional development' than your current phrasing."

Your output transforms these suggestions into direct, forceful commands like 'needs to change' and 'should manage'. This alters the intent from a recommendation to an order, which is a significant change in meaning.\n*   Lexical Shift: The original's goal is 'creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work'.

Your version, \"Our study gives some ideas,\" completely loses this assertive meaning and professional tone.\n\n- Lexical Downgrade: While simplification is required, key concepts were oversimplified to the point of meaning loss. \"Increased investment in professional development\" implies a formal, strategic financial decision. \"The company can spend more money on training\" is a casual observation that lacks the same weight.\n\n- Suggestion: The core meaning of a 'recommendation' must be preserved. Rephrase the opening to be more direct. Use language like, \"Our study shows that Girox Foods should change.\" This maintains the A2 level while restoring the original text's purpose. The text must convey a direct recommendation, not a list of possibilities."

The original text has the formal tone of a business recommendation. Your output simplifies this into a general summary, losing the core meaning of a direct, evidence-based proposal. This is an immediate failure.\n\nFurther violations detected:\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not A2. This is unacceptable.\n\n- B1/B2 Vocabulary Contamination: The text uses multiple words above the A2 level. These include 'management' (B1), 'invest' (B1), 'development' (B1), 'communication' (B1), 'flexible' (B2), and 'means' (B2). These words are too complex for an A2 reader.\n\n- B1 Grammatical Structures: The text uses structures that are too advanced. The sentence 'we recommend that Girox Foods changes...' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 structure. The sentence 'Managers need to give their staff interesting work that helps them learn and grow' also uses a 'that-clause'. These must be simplified.\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the entire text to restore the meaning of a formal recommendation. Start with 'Our study shows that Girox Foods should change...' to be more direct.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'management style' with 'the way managers lead'. Replace 'invest more money in' with 'use more money for'. Replace 'flexible work hours' with 'hours that workers can choose'.\n\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all 'that-clauses'. Split the sentences. Write: 'We recommend something. Girox Foods should change its management style.' Write: 'Managers need to give staff interesting work. This work helps them learn.'"

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message due to oversimplification. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8945 falling below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Challenge): The original specifies managers must 'challenge our staff'. Your output changes this to 'give staff interesting work'. These are not equivalent. 'Challenge' implies difficulty and growth; 'interesting' only implies engagement. The core meaning was lost.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Recognition): The original recommends 'positive reinforcement and recognition'. Your output reduces this to 'say \"good job\"'. This is a drastic oversimplification that loses the formal, broader business concept of recognition, which can include bonuses, promotions, and formal awards.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Development): The original calls for 'Increased investment in professional development'. Your output states 'use more money for training'. This simplification loses the concept of long-term career growth ('professional development') and reduces it to simple task-based instruction ('training').\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore reflects the replacement of key professional terms like 'professional development', 'recognition', and 'challenge' with overly simplistic phrases, failing to retain the lexical substance of the source text.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost concepts. Do not replace complex ideas with simple ones that do not carry the same meaning. For 'challenge', use a phrase that includes the idea of difficulty and learning. For 'recognition', use a phrase that is broader than just verbal praise. For 'professional development', ensure the concept of career growth is present."

Adherence to the CEFR level is irrelevant when the core message is lost.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification process must preserve the original intent. Rephrase to maintain the sense of a formal recommendation. The concept of 'positive reinforcement' must be conveyed more accurately than just 'tell workers they did a good job.' The simplification has fundamentally altered the message, resulting in a complete failure of the task."

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's formal, professional meaning.\n\n- Primary Failure: Your simplification of key concepts was too extreme. The original's 'positive reinforcement and recognition' is a formal business practice. Your version, 'praise their staff for good work and say thank you more often', reduces it to simple politeness, losing the core message.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You used the B2-level word 'flexible'. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or simpler.\n- Fidelity Warning: The BERTScore of 0.9028 is barely acceptable. This reflects the loss of specific terms like 'social and intercultural communication', which you replaced with the vague phrase 'talk better with different people'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original meaning using only A2 vocabulary. Replace 'flexible' with a descriptive phrase like 'let workers choose when they start and finish'. Rephrase the section on training to be more specific about communication between different groups of people without using B1/B2 vocabulary."
