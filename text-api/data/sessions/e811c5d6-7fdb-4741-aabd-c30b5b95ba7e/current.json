Marine protected areas are places in the ocean set aside to keep wildlife safe. He wants to undo the damage that humans cause, such as overfishing, pollution and littering.  \n\nDuring his trips, Lewis has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs. Coral reefs are living structures made of tiny sea animals that build hard skeletons. These reefs are bleached by warmer water. He also saw underwater deserts in the Red Sea. In these deserts, there was no life and plastic was everywhere.  \n\nPugh thinks that nature can recover if it is given enough space, but the clock is ticking. If we do not start caring for our seas, we may soon face a problem that is very hard to solve.",

    "feedback": "Approval: PASS. This is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets all core requirements.\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually accurate and correctly preserves all key information from the original text, including numbers and causes of damage.\nMetric Compliance: The submission passed all metric checks, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.7855 and a BERTScore of 0.9184, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is correct.\nQualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy is excellent. You effectively broke down complex sentences into shorter, more readable ones. The definitions provided for the keywords 'marine protected areas' and 'coral reefs' are clear, accurate, and seamlessly integrated. Vocabulary choices are strong, with effective replacements like 'expeditions' to 'trips' and 'unsolvable problem' to 'a problem that is very hard to solve'. The overall text is fluent and well-suited for a B1 audience.",
