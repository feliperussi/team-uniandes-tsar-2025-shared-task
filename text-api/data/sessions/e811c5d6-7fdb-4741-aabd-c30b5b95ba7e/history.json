While the text passed the critical Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, its sentence structure is too complex for the target audience. The primary issue is the use of long sentences with embedded parenthetical definitions. For example, the sentence 'He has swum over coral reefs (living structures made of tiny sea animals that build hard skeletons) that are bleached by warmer water' combines a main clause, a long definition, and a relative clause, which is a B2-level structure. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, separate the definitions into their own simple sentences. For instance: 'He has swum over coral reefs. Coral reefs are living structures made of tiny sea animals. These reefs are bleached by warmer water.' This approach will break down the complexity and make the information more accessible.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. This is likely due to complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'He also saw underwater deserts under the waters of the Red Sea, where no life exists and plastic is everywhere' uses a non-defining relative clause with 'where', which is a B2-level feature. Similarly, phrases like 'damage caused by human actions' use passive structures that increase complexity. To meet the B1 requirement, these sentences should be broken down further. For instance, the sentence about the Red Sea could be simplified to: 'He also saw underwater deserts in the Red Sea. In these deserts, there was no life and plastic was everywhere.' On a positive note, the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, and the definitions provided for the keywords were clear and effective.",

This is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets all core requirements.\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually accurate and correctly preserves all key information from the original text, including numbers and causes of damage.\nMetric Compliance: The submission passed all metric checks, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.7855 and a BERTScore of 0.9184, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is correct.\nQualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy is excellent. You effectively broke down complex sentences into shorter, more readable ones. The definitions provided for the keywords 'marine protected areas' and 'coral reefs' are clear, accurate, and seamlessly integrated. Vocabulary choices are strong, with effective replacements like 'expeditions' to 'trips' and 'unsolvable problem' to 'a problem that is very hard to solve'. The overall text is fluent and well-suited for a B1 audience.",
