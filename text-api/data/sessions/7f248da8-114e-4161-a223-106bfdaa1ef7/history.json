The primary cause is the first sentence: 'Asteroids, which are rocks that fly through space, are called 'Potentially Hazardous' if they are close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' This sentence is too long and uses a complex grammatical structure (a non-defining relative clause) to define the keyword. Suggestion: Define the keyword in a separate, simple sentence to improve readability and meet the B1 requirement. For example: 'Asteroids are rocks that fly through space. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous' if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' On a positive note, the text successfully maintained factual integrity, and the high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.94) metrics confirm that meaning was preserved. The strategy of splitting the final sentence was also effective.",

The primary reason is likely the structural complexity of the sentence: 'Some are called 'Potentially Hazardous' because they are close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' This single sentence combines a subordinate clause of reason ('because') with an 'enough to' structure, making it too advanced for B1. The passive voice in 'none of them are expected to be a threat' also adds complexity. Suggestion: Break the complex sentence into two or three simpler ones. For example: 'Some asteroids are called 'Potentially Hazardous'. This is because they pass very close to Earth's orbit, within 7.5 million kilometres.'

Second, the sentence 'With technology that is already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about a possible impact' is structurally complex for a B1 level.
