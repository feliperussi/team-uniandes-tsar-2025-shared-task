This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The original text establishes a direct causal link: the rebellion results in the punishment of sending youths to the Minotaur. Your version weakens this by stating 'The king was angry. So he gave them a punishment.' This separates the concepts and reduces the impact, changing the meaning from a formal consequence to a reaction based on anger.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'punishment' is classified as B1. You were required to simplify all non-A2 vocabulary. You used this word directly. This is a critical error.\n- The phrase 'A Minotaur is a monster that eats people' is redundant. The text already establishes that a monster lived in the maze and that it ate the young people.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the section about the punishment to restore the direct link between the rebellion and its consequence. You must remove the B1 word 'punishment' and explain the concept using only A2 vocabulary. Example: 'Because the people of Athens fought back, the king of Crete did something terrible to them.'",

The concept of punishment is not optional; it is the central point.\n- Secondary Deviation: The word 'inspiration' was replaced with 'idea'. 'Inspiration' conveys the source of creative motivation, a stronger and more precise meaning than the generic term 'idea'. This also contributed to the low meaning score.\n\nWhile the sentence structure and vocabulary are appropriate for A2, the loss of core meaning constitutes a total failure of the task.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the concept of 'punishment'. The sentence must be rephrased to include this key concept. Use a phrase like 'To punish the people of Athens...' or 'As a punishment...'. The original meaning must be preserved.",

The original text uses a single clause: 'As a punishment, Minos... forces the Athenians to send...'. Your version splits this into two separate ideas: 'the king punished them. Every year, he made Athens send...'. This separation dilutes the immediate and forceful nature of the consequence.\n\n- Tertiary Deviation: The symbolic connection was oversimplified.

Your version, 'Suzanne thinks Katniss Everdeen is like a Theseus from the future', is a much weaker and more literal comparison.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meanings.
