The MeaningBERT score of 0.834 and BERTScore of 0.9237 confirm that the core message and key details were preserved during simplification. The CEFR classifier result of A2 is accurate. The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 levels, with appropriate word choices like 'war', 'mixed', and 'strange'. The use of the B1 word 'hunger' is acceptable as it is part of a proper noun. Structurally, the text correctly breaks down complex sentences from the original into short, simple sentences connected by the appropriate A2 conjunction 'so'. No errors were detected.",
