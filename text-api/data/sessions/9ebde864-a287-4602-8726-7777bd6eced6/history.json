MeaningBERT score of 0.8334 and BERTScore of 0.9263 confirm excellent preservation of the original meaning and key terms. The CEFR classifier correctly rated the output as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The potentially complex term 'electronic copy' was correctly identified and immediately defined using simple A1/A2 vocabulary ('a book you read on a computer'). This is exemplary.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text demonstrates a masterful use of A2 sentence structure. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple, declarative statements. For example, 'It made 152.5 million dollars in its opening weekend in North America alone!' was correctly simplified into two separate sentences.",
