The book came out in 2008.\nYou can now read the book in 26 different languages. Millions of people around the world bought it. It was the first book for young people to sell more than a million electronic copies. An electronic copy is a book you read on a computer.\nNow, \"The Hunger Games\" is also a big Hollywood movie. The movie is very popular too. In its first weekend, it made 152.5 million dollars. That was only in North America.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers (26 languages, 152.5 million dollars), and names (Suzanne Collins, North America) are preserved with 100% accuracy.\n- Metric Compliance: The text exceeds all metric thresholds. MeaningBERT score of 0.8334 and BERTScore of 0.9263 confirm excellent preservation of the original meaning and key terms. The CEFR classifier correctly rated the output as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The potentially complex term 'electronic copy' was correctly identified and immediately defined using simple A1/A2 vocabulary ('a book you read on a computer'). This is exemplary.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text demonstrates a masterful use of A2 sentence structure. Complex sentences from the original text have been correctly broken down into short, simple, declarative statements. For example, 'It made 152.5 million dollars in its opening weekend in North America alone!' was correctly simplified into two separate sentences.",
