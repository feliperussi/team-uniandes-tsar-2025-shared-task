    "text_translated": "Based on our results, we recommend a new management style. Girox Foods should focus more on its people. We should let employees choose their own work hours. We should also allow them to work from a location they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff. They also need to give positive comments. They must show they value the work people do. Spending more money on professional training could also help. This can create a positive work environment. This is very important for social and communication skills. This will help employees do their best work.",
