Your output transforms this into a simple, direct question ('How do genes affect our language?'). This shift fundamentally alters the meaning from a statement about research to a basic question, causing the low meaning score.\n- Factual Integrity: The factual details, such as the timeline and the comparison to monkeys, are correct.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are appropriate for the level.\n- Conclusion: Despite good structural and vocabulary choices, the failure to accurately represent the original text's core message is a critical error.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the introduction to restore the original meaning.

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Core Message Dilution: The original text describes a connected scientific inquiry about the 'influence' of genetics. Your output breaks this down into a list of simple, disconnected facts, which loses the central idea of scientific investigation and connection.\n- Loss of Nuance: By oversimplifying, you lost the nuance of the original's argument. The relationship between the gene mutation and language ability is presented as a simple fact rather than a scientific hypothesis being explored. The original's focus on uncertainty and ongoing questions is weakened.\n- Structural Impact on Meaning: While the sentences are correctly A2 in structure, their extreme simplicity and lack of connection contributed to the low meaning score. The text reads like a list, not a coherent explanation.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Re-introduce the concept of scientific questioning and connection. Combine some sentences to show how one idea leads to the next. For example, instead of 'This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain control our mouth and face,' try 'This gene seems important for speaking because it helps our brain control our mouth and face.'
