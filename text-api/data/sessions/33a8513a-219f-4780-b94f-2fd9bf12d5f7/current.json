    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8762 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text. Key terms like 'employee turnover' and 'investigate the causes' were replaced with overly simple phrases, losing necessary lexical detail.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct violation of the core requirement.\n- Grammatical Complexity: The sentence 'Girox Foods has about 12% of employees who leave each year' uses a relative clause ('who leave...'), which is a B1 structure.\n- Grammatical Complexity: The sentences 'This report looks for reasons why employees leave' and 'It also looks at why employees feel connected to work' use subordinate wh-clauses. These are B1 structures and are too complex for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Eliminate all complex clauses. Rephrase sentences to adhere to a simple Subject-Verb-Object structure. Example: 'About 12% of employees leave Girox Foods each year.' Split the 'why' clauses into separate, simple questions or statements.",
