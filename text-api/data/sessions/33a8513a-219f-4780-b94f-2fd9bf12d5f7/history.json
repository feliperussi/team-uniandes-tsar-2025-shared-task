The words 'engaged' (B1), 'means' (B2), 'workplace' (B2), and 'engagement' (C1) are not permitted.\n- The attempt to define complex words is noted, but the execution is flawed. The word 'means' is itself a B2 vocabulary item and cannot be used to define other words at an A2 level.\n- The C1 noun 'engagement' is used directly. This is a severe violation of the A2 standard.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Remove all B1 and higher vocabulary. Do not use 'engaged', 'engagement', 'workplace', or 'means'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence 'This report will find why workers are engaged' to 'This report will find why workers feel connected to their jobs'.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence 'We will study employee engagement in the company' to 'We will study how connected workers feel to the company'.\n- Suggestion: Replace definitional sentences using 'means'.

The text also fails on CEFR compliance and vocabulary.\n\nCEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an instant failure. The cause is the use of vocabulary above the A2 level.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words that are not on the A2 list. This is a critical error. The word 'turnover' is C1 level. The words 'standard' and 'connection' are B1 level. These words must be simplified.\n\nStructural Issues: The text is broken into too many short, repetitive sentences. While simplicity is required, this structure is unnatural and inefficient.\n\nSuggestion: Replace complex vocabulary with A2-level phrases. Replace 'turnover' with 'the number of people who leave their jobs'. Replace 'industry standard' with 'what is normal for other companies'. Combine related ideas into single, simple sentences using 'and' or 'but'.",
