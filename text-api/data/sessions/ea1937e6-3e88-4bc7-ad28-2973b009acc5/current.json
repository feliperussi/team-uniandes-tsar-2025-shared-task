    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as \"B2\" likely because the sentence \"Asteroids that could be dangerous (PHAs) are those that pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit.\" uses a parenthetical abbreviation and a long modifier phrase, which push it above B1 level. To correct this, split complex sentences into shorter ones and avoid parentheses. For example: \"Potentially hazardous asteroids are called PHAs. They are asteroids that pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit.\" This will simplify the structure and help meet the B1 requirements.",
