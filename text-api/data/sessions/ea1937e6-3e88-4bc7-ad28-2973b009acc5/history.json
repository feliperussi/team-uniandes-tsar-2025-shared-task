For example, the original emphasizes NASA\u2019s ability to \u201cmake predictions about possible impact,\u201d but the output reduces this to \u201csee if an asteroid could hit the Earth,\u201d losing the nuance of forecasting scenarios. Also, the BERTScore of 0.8982 is below the required 0.90 threshold, showing that key terms like \u201cpredictions about possible impact,\u201d \u201cPHAs,\u201d and the phrase \u201ctwo defence solutions\u201d were paraphrased in ways that sacrifice important lexical detail. To improve, preserve core technical expressions (e.g., keep \u201cmake predictions about possible impact\u201d), maintain conditional phrasing around defence launches, and avoid adding speculative conclusions such as \u201clong before it happens.\u201d This will help restore the lost meaning and increase overlap with the original text.",
