    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7079 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text's central idea of 'speeding up evolution' was lost and replaced with the vague phrase 'make us change faster', which fails to preserve the core message. The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8766 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing essential keywords like 'evolution', 'species', 'augmenting', and 'enhance'. While the output text successfully uses A2-level grammar and vocabulary, it does so at the cost of the original's meaning. The simplification was too aggressive and resulted in a critical loss of information. Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. Simplification must not eliminate the central concept. A phrase like 'help people develop more quickly' would be a more accurate A2-level replacement for 'speed up our evolution'.",
