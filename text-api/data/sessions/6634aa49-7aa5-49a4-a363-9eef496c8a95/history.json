This indicates a significant loss of the original text's meaning and structure.\n\n- Primary Deviation: Over-simplification. The original text's complex sentences were broken into too many short, choppy statements. This destroyed the logical connections between ideas.\n- Evidence of Failure: The original sentence '...enhance our mathematical ability, audiovisual perception and our memory...' was split into three separate sentences. This fragmentation is the direct cause of the low fidelity score.\n- Evidence of Failure: The phrase 'speed up our evolution... by augmenting our bodies' shows a clear cause and effect. Your version, 'We can think how humans change... We can speed this change by adding new parts...', weakens this connection by splitting it across two sentences.\n- Suggestion: Recombine sentences to restore meaning. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and'. The text must be simple, not fragmented. Corrective example: 'We can make our math skill, how we see and hear, and our memory better.'

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7211 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8669 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates an unacceptable loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail due to oversimplification.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's concept of 'evolution as a species' is a key idea. Your replacement, 'how people change', is too general and loses the specific biological meaning. The word 'fascinating' implies strong interest and wonder, which is not captured by the weak replacement 'interesting'.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key vocabulary. Words like 'evolution', 'species', 'augmenting', 'enhance', and 'perception' were replaced with overly simple terms, breaking the lexical link to the source text.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The output is a list of disconnected, choppy sentences. This is not an acceptable simplification. The original text presented a connected idea. Your version reads like a set of simple facts with no logical flow.\n\n- Suggestion: You must preserve the core concepts. Rephrase to restore the idea of 'evolution'. Use a phrase like 'how our bodies will change over a long time'. Combine the sentences about abilities using 'and' to create a more natural sentence structure. Example: 'This will make us better at math, and it will help our memory and the way we see and hear.' The simplification must not destroy the meaning.",

The BERTScore of 0.8787 also fails to meet the 0.90 standard for lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Deviation: The original text's key concept of 'speeding up' evolution was completely lost. Your phrase 'change how our species evolves' is too vague and does not convey the intended meaning of acceleration.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You failed to replace required B1 vocabulary. The word 'fascinating' was retained in your output. This is a B1 word and is unacceptable.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You failed to replace the B1 word 'species'. This word was retained in your output and is not on the A2 list.\n- Oversimplification: The text was broken into so many short, disconnected sentences that the logical flow and nuance of the original idea were destroyed, contributing to the low meaning score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of acceleration by using a phrase like 'make how we evolve faster'. Replace 'fascinating' with 'interesting'. Replace 'species' with 'people' or 'humans'. Combine some sentences to improve logical flow.",

The original text's central idea of 'speeding up evolution' was lost and replaced with the vague phrase 'make us change faster', which fails to preserve the core message. The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8766 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing essential keywords like 'evolution', 'species', 'augmenting', and 'enhance'. While the output text successfully uses A2-level grammar and vocabulary, it does so at the cost of the original's meaning. The simplification was too aggressive and resulted in a critical loss of information. Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. Simplification must not eliminate the central concept. A phrase like 'help people develop more quickly' would be a more accurate A2-level replacement for 'speed up our evolution'.",
