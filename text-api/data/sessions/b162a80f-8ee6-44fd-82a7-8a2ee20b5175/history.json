        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to two factors. First, the vocabulary was not simplified enough. The C1-level word 'appreciation' was used, which is more complex than the original text's 'recognition'. A better B1 alternative would be 'show they value the work'. Second, the sentence structure remains too complex for B1. For example, the sentence 'Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff, and they should also give more positive feedback and show appreciation for the work that they do' is a long compound sentence. It should be split into two shorter sentences to meet the B1 standard.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core message and key details were preserved with high fidelity. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is a key strength; complex concepts like 'positive reinforcement and recognition' were skillfully simplified to 'positive feedback and show they value the work', which is much more accessible for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the structural choice to split a longer sentence into two simpler ones ('Managers need to find... They should also give...') significantly improves readability. The addition of the connector 'Finally' also enhances the text's flow. No improvements are necessary.",
