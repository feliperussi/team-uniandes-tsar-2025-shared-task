As part of this, we should look for ways to offer more flexible working hours and also consider how we can allow employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff. They should also give more positive feedback and show they value the work that they do. Finally, spending more money on professional training could help create a positive atmosphere for employees so they can produce their best work, especially in the area of social and cultural communication.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics confirm that the core message and key details were preserved with high fidelity. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is a key strength; complex concepts like 'positive reinforcement and recognition' were skillfully simplified to 'positive feedback and show they value the work', which is much more accessible for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the structural choice to split a longer sentence into two simpler ones ('Managers need to find... They should also give...') significantly improves readability. The addition of the connector 'Finally' also enhances the text's flow. No improvements are necessary.",
