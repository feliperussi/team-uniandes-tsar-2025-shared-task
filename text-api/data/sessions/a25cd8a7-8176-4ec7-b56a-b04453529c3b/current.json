    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8897) and BERTScore (0.9605) are well above the required thresholds of 0.75 and 0.90 respectively, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating successful simplification to the target level. The writer effectively simplified complex phrases such as 'devalued' to 'seem less important' and 'for its own sake' to 'just to be positive', making the text highly accessible for a B1 audience without losing the original nuance. The use of 'feedback' as a keyword was appropriate, as it is a B1 term and was not unnecessarily replaced. The overall flow and structure are clear and easy to follow. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
