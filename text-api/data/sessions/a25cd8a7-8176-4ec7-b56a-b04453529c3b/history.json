While the general idea is conveyed, the simplification altered key semantic details. Specifically, the original's phrase 'resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism' was simplified to 'try not to give any negative comments at that time'. This change loses the specific nuance of 'constructive criticism' (a particular type of feedback) and the strategic implication of 'resist the temptation'. The output's 'negative comments' is a broader term, and 'try not to give' is a less nuanced instruction than 'resist the temptation'. This shift in specificity and strategic advice likely contributed to the lower MeaningBERT score. To improve, ensure that specific terms like 'constructive criticism' are either retained or replaced with a very close synonym, and that the strategic intent of phrases like 'resist the temptation' is preserved.",

Additionally, evaluate if 'for its own sake' can be rephrased more simply, perhaps 'just because it is good' or 'without adding anything else'.

The writer effectively simplified complex phrases such as 'devalued' to 'seem less important' and 'for its own sake' to 'just to be positive', making the text highly accessible for a B1 audience without losing the original nuance.
