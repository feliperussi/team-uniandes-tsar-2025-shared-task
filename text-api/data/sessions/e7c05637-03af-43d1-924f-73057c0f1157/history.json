Your output reduces these complex ideas to 'breeding programmes' and 'variety', losing the crucial concepts of international cooperation and the scientific reason (genetics) for the programmes. The meaning is fundamentally damaged.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8782 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key specific terms like 'international', 'endangered species', and 'genetic diversity' were lost, failing to maintain lexical fidelity with the source.\n\n- Tertiary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text was classified as B1, not A2. The sentence 'When wild animal numbers go down, they can become too similar' uses a subordinate clause of time ('When...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. This structure is too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Failure: The B1-level concept 'breeding programmes' was kept from the original text without being simplified or explained in A2 terms.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Explain the concept of 'genetic diversity' in simple A2 terms, such as 'This helps the animals be different from each other. This is healthy for them.' Eliminate the B1 sentence structure. Split 'When wild animal numbers go down...' into two separate, simple sentences. Simplify the term 'breeding programmes'.",

The original text's core message about zoos acting as a 'safeguard' to increase 'genetic diversity' was lost. Your version weakens this to 'keep the animals from becoming too similar'. This is a critical loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8632 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key lexical items from the original were not preserved, contributing to the meaning loss.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not A2. This is caused by complex sentence structures. The sentence 'When animals are too similar they can have health problems' uses a subordinate 'when' clause. The sentence 'By breeding in zoos the animals stay genetically different' uses a 'By + gerund' structure. Both are B1 level grammar.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words above the A2 level without simplification. 'rare' (B1), 'safely' (B1), 'release' (B1), and 'breed' (C1) are not A2 vocabulary.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the core concepts of 'safeguard' and 'genetic diversity' using A2 language. Break all complex sentences into simple, short sentences. Replace all B1 and C1 words. For example, 'breed' must be replaced with 'have babies'. 'rare' must be replaced with 'animals that are not common'.",

This fragmentation contributes to the loss of meaning.

You must also restore the concept of 'genetic diversity' and explain it in simple A2 terms, for example, 'making sure the animals' families are different and strong'. Combine some of the short, choppy sentences to create a more coherent A2-level paragraph. Remove the sentence about animals getting sick.",
