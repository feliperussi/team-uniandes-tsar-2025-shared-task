    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6767 is below the required 0.75. The simplification of the original text has led to a loss of nuance in the core message. The original text emphasizes 'worrying trends' that are hidden by the spending figure, implying systemic, ongoing issues. Your version simplifies this to 'very bad problems' and adds 'These problems are getting bigger', which is an interpretation not explicitly stated in the original. This alters the precise nature and emphasis of the issues. The original's connection between the credit card debt and unnecessary spending as 'trends' is also diluted by breaking the information into overly fragmented sentences. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to better capture the concept of 'worrying trends' without adding new information. Ensure the connection between the credit card debt and the unnecessary spending is clearly presented as the 'problems' or 'trends' mentioned earlier. For example, 'This number hides two big problems for people and for our world. First, people use credit cards too much. Second, they buy things they do not need.'",
