Your version simplifies this to 'this number hides two very bad problems. These problems are getting worse for people and for the world'. The nuance of 'trends' (ongoing patterns) is lost, replaced by the more static 'problems'. The intensity of 'far more worrying' is not fully conveyed by 'very bad'. Crucially, the addition of 'These problems are getting worse' introduces a new, active element of deterioration that is not present in the original text's description of the trends. The original implies the trends are inherently worrying, not necessarily actively worsening beyond that. This alters the core message. Additionally, 'society and for the environment' are specific concepts that 'people and for the world' do not fully encapsulate, further contributing to the meaning shift. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence to accurately reflect 'worrying trends' without adding new information like 'getting worse'. Ensure the severity implied by 'far more worrying' is maintained. Consider using 'society' and 'environment' if they can be simplified to A2 terms without losing their specific meaning, or find A2 equivalents that better capture the original concepts.",

The core message of the original text, which highlights 'worrying trends' and specific economic concepts, has been diluted in the simplified version. For example, 'worrying trends' was simplified to 'very big worries'. While 'worries' is an A2 word, it loses the dynamic and ongoing nature implied by 'trends'. The original text also refers to 'consumer spending' and 'average wardrobe budget', which are specific economic ideas. Your version simplifies these to 'people spend a lot of money on clothes' and 'money for clothes', which, while simpler, loses some of the precise economic context. The 'not only... but also' structure in the original emphasizes a dual problem, which is lost when split into two simple sentences. These changes, while aiming for simplicity, collectively diminish the depth of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the concept of 'trends' as ongoing patterns, perhaps using 'things that are happening' or 'problems that continue'. Ensure that the economic context of 'spending' and 'budget' is conveyed more clearly, even with A2 vocabulary.",

The core message regarding the severity and nature of the issues was not fully preserved. The original text emphasizes 'two far more worrying trends for society and for the environment', highlighting ongoing patterns and their significant impact. Your version simplifies this to 'two big worries. These worries are bad for people. They are also bad for our world.' This loses the crucial nuance of 'trends' (implying a developing pattern) and the emphasis on 'far more worrying'. The impact on 'society and the environment' is also softened to a generic 'bad for people' and 'bad for our world'. This reduction in specificity and intensity diminishes the original's core message about serious, systemic issues. Additionally, the word 'owe' is classified as B1, which is above the A2 standard. This word must be replaced with simpler A2 vocabulary to ensure full CEFR compliance. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to clearly state that the issues are serious and ongoing problems, not just 'big worries'. Replace 'owe' with a simpler phrase like 'must give back money' or 'have to pay back money'.",

Your version simplifies this to 'very bad problems' and adds 'These problems are getting bigger', which is an interpretation not explicitly stated in the original. This alters the precise nature and emphasis of the issues. The original's connection between the credit card debt and unnecessary spending as 'trends' is also diluted by breaking the information into overly fragmented sentences. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to better capture the concept of 'worrying trends' without adding new information. Ensure the connection between the credit card debt and the unnecessary spending is clearly presented as the 'problems' or 'trends' mentioned earlier. For example, 'This number hides two big problems for people and for our world. First, people use credit cards too much. Second, they buy things they do not need.'",
