This is likely due to the sentence: 'By 2010 the team had recorded about 90 % of the asteroids that are about 1 km wide and pass near Earth.' The use of the past perfect tense ('had recorded') combined with a long relative clause makes this sentence too grammatically complex for the B1 level. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences, such as: 'By 2010, the team had recorded about 90% of these asteroids. These asteroids are about 1 km wide and pass near Earth.' On a positive note, the output passed all factual and meaning preservation checks, and the keyword definitions were clear.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The primary reason for failure is a significant factual error that changes the meaning of a key statement. The original text states 'With an estimated 50 left to log...', but the output incorrectly states 'NASA says about 50 more objects still need to be simple.' This changes the remaining task from one of recording or cataloging objects to making them 'simple', which is nonsensical in this context. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR Compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the required 'B1'. This is likely due to the use of long, complex parenthetical phrases to define terms, such as '(a group of scientists at NASA that works to protect Earth from space rocks)'. For a B1 level, it is better to use two separate, simpler sentences. Suggestion: First, correct the factual error by replacing 'simple' with a word like 'recorded' or 'found'. Second, to achieve a B1 level, break the first two sentences into shorter ones, separating the definitions from the main clauses.",

The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in overly simple sentence structures and vocabulary.

To achieve a B1 level, these sentences should be combined using a relative clause, for instance: 'They look for near-Earth objects, which are space rocks that come within 50 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit.'
