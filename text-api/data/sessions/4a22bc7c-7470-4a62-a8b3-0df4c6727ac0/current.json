Near\u2011Earth objects are space rocks that come within 50\u202fmillion kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit. These objects can be as big as mountains and are about 1\u202fkm wide. By 2010 the team had recorded about 90\u202f% of these asteroids. NASA knows about 887 objects and says none of them are a big danger to our planet. NASA says about 50 more objects still need to be recorded.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target level. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in overly simple sentence structures and vocabulary. The main issue is the choppy flow, exemplified by the sentences: 'They look for near\u2011Earth objects. Near\u2011Earth objects are space rocks...'. This repetition is characteristic of an A2 level. To achieve a B1 level, these sentences should be combined using a relative clause, for instance: 'They look for near-Earth objects, which are space rocks that come within 50 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit.' While the factual integrity was excellent and the keyword definitions were handled well, the failure to meet the target CEFR level is critical.",
