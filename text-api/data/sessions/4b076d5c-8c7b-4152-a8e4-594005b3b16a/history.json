Sentences 1 and 4 are too long (19 and 18 words), exceeding the B1 guideline of approximately 15 words per sentence. Factual accuracy cannot be judged as no Original Text was provided."

The vocabulary is entirely within the A1-A2 range, making it immediately understandable. The writer correctly simplified complex ideas like 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' into B1-level explanations ('by chance' and 'does not tell you what will happen in the future'). Factual accuracy is maintained. No errors found."
