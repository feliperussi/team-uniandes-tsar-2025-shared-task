If this happens in real life, it is probably just by chance. It does not tell you what will happen in the future. We often dream about these things, but they don't happen. We probably forget those dreams.",

    "feedback": "The text fully adheres to the B1 standard. Sentences are short, clear, and use simple grammatical structures. The vocabulary is entirely within the A1-A2 range, making it immediately understandable. The writer correctly simplified complex ideas like 'coincidence' and 'prophecy' into B1-level explanations ('by chance' and 'does not tell you what will happen in the future'). Factual accuracy is maintained. No errors found.",
