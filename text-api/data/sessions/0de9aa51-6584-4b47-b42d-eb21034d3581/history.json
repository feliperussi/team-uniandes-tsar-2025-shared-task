        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. While the definitions for 'employee turnover' and 'employee engagement' are helpful for a B1 audience, the overall sentence structure and length contribute to the higher CEFR classification. For example, the sentence 'At Girox Foods, we have an employee turnover of about 12% each year, which is the number of employees who leave the company' combines a statement with a definition using a relative clause, making it longer and more complex than typical B1 sentences. Similarly, 'Based on what we find, we will suggest ways to make employees feel better about their place of work and to keep more employees' uses a more advanced introductory phrase and sentence structure. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into two, rephrasing complex clauses, and using simpler sentence connectors. For instance, the first sentence could be split: 'At Girox Foods, we have an employee turnover of about 12% each year. This is the number of employees who leave the company.' The MeaningBERT score of 0.8674 and BERTScore of 0.9274 indicate excellent meaning preservation and fidelity, so the core content is well-maintained. The issue lies solely in the complexity of expression.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8564) and BERTScore (0.9248) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The writer effectively defined the specified keywords, 'employee turnover' and 'employee engagement', which significantly aids comprehension for a B1 audience. Sentence structures were appropriately simplified and broken down, improving readability. For example, the original's single long sentence about the report's objective was clearly and accurately split into multiple, more manageable sentences. The vocabulary strategy was well-executed, with complex terms either defined or replaced with B1-appropriate synonyms. A minor suggestion for improvement would be to slightly refine the flow in the final part of the report's objective. The sentences 'We will use what we find. From this, we will suggest ways...' could be more smoothly integrated, perhaps by combining them or using a more direct connector, such as 'Based on these findings, we will suggest ways...' This would enhance the overall coherence without sacrificing simplicity. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification.",
