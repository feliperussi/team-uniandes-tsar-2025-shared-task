    "text_translated": "At Girox Foods, we have an `employee turnover` of about 12% each year. This is the number of employees who leave the company. Although this might not seem high when you first look, the normal level for this industry is 7%. The main aim of this report is to look into the reasons for `employee engagement` in the company. `Employee engagement` means how interested and involved employees are in their work. We will use what we find. From this, we will suggest ways to make employees feel better about their place of work and to keep more employees.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8564) and BERTScore (0.9248) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The writer effectively defined the specified keywords, 'employee turnover' and 'employee engagement', which significantly aids comprehension for a B1 audience. Sentence structures were appropriately simplified and broken down, improving readability. For example, the original's single long sentence about the report's objective was clearly and accurately split into multiple, more manageable sentences. The vocabulary strategy was well-executed, with complex terms either defined or replaced with B1-appropriate synonyms. A minor suggestion for improvement would be to slightly refine the flow in the final part of the report's objective. The sentences 'We will use what we find. From this, we will suggest ways...' could be more smoothly integrated, perhaps by combining them or using a more direct connector, such as 'Based on these findings, we will suggest ways...' This would enhance the overall coherence without sacrificing simplicity. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification.",
