    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8824 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n- The simplification is too aggressive. While the meaning is generally preserved, the lexical connection to the source text is too weak.\n- The original phrase 'hit the nail on the head' was reduced to 'was right', losing the specific phrasing.\n- The concept of 'parental influence' was replaced with 'how parents change what children do', which is a significant lexical departure.\n- The action 'engages in a different conversation online' was oversimplified to 'talks online', losing key vocabulary.\nSuggestion: Retain more of the original's specific vocabulary while simplifying the sentence structure. The goal is to preserve key terms, not eliminate them. Rephrase to maintain higher lexical fidelity to the source text. For example, 'engages in a conversation' could be simplified to 'has a conversation' to stay closer to the original's phrasing than the generic verb 'talks'.",
