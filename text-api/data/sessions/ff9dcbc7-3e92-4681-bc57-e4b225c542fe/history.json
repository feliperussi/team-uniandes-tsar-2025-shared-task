This is the primary reason for failure.\n\nSecondary Failure: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, which is an automatic failure. The target is A2.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Fidelity Loss (BERTScore): The score is low because key concepts were oversimplified. The original's 'hit the nail on the head' became 'was right'. The idea of 'parental influence' was lost. The phrase 'sit together in silence' was reduced to 'sit together', losing an important detail.\n- CEFR Classification Error (B1): While the vocabulary is mostly A2, the classifier has identified the text as B1. This may be due to the conceptual load of the topic (multitasking, online vs. real life) being interpreted as too advanced for the A2 level, despite the simple vocabulary.\n- Structural Weakness: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. This choppy, list-like structure is unnatural and fails to create a coherent paragraph. For example: 'They arrange to meet and sit together. But each has a different online conversation.'\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Restore Fidelity: Re-integrate key details using simple A2 language. Instead of just 'sit together', use 'sit together but they do not talk'.\n- Improve Flow: Combine some of the extremely short sentences using A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', or 'so' to create a more natural text. Example: 'Parents use social media while they cook, so their children see this and may text during homework.'\n- Address B1 Classification: Simplifying the structure and ensuring the concepts are explicitly stated in A2 terms may help correct the classification.",

The simplification was too aggressive, losing lexical detail required for a faithful A2 summary.\n\n- Lexical Loss: Key phrases were oversimplified, causing the low BERTScore. 'hit the nail on the head' became 'was right'. 'switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations' became 'move from real life to online life'. This simplification sacrifices too much of the original's specific language.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'She said that parents are examples for their children' uses a 'that-clause'. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore more specific vocabulary from the original text without using B1-level idioms. Break the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two separate, simpler sentences. For example: 'She talked about parents. She said they are examples for their children.'",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The score is low because specific, meaningful phrases from the original were replaced with overly generic terms. For example, 'hit the nail on the head' became 'the point was clear', and 'parental influence' became 'talked about parents'. This simplification sacrifices too much lexical detail.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'switch' is present in the output. This word is not on the approved A2 vocabulary list and is an automatic failure point.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. While A2 requires simplicity, this level of fragmentation is unnatural and damages the flow of information. For example: 'Children see this. Parents also use social media... Children see this too.'\n\nSuggestion: Restore more of the original's key vocabulary while keeping the sentence structure simple. Replace the B1 word 'switch' with an A2 phrase like 'change between'. Combine overly fragmented sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to improve readability.",

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low. Your simplification has removed too much of the original text's specific vocabulary, resulting in a loss of lexical detail.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, which is an instant fail. This is caused by using vocabulary and structures that are too advanced for the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The idiom 'hit the nail on the head' is a B1+ structure. It is not permissible at the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'influence' is B1 vocabulary. It must be simplified or removed.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is excessively fragmented into short, choppy sentences. This unnatural structure fails to connect ideas logically using appropriate A2-level connectors.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove the idiom 'hit the nail on the head'. Replace it with an A2 phrase like 'The speaker was right.'\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the concept of 'parental influence'. Use a simple explanation, for example: 'She talked about how parents change what their children do.'\n\n- Suggestion: Combine overly fragmented sentences. For example, 'Parents use social media while they cook dinner or wait at a red light, and their children see this.' is better than four separate sentences.",
