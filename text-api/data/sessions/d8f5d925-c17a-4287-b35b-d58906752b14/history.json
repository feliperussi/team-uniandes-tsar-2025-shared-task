Bridges are strong structures that help people and vehicles cross rivers or roads. Luckily, damage like bridges falling down because of earthquakes does not happen very often, especially with modern bridges. Engineers, who are people trained to design and build structures, have learned how to make bridges in places where earthquakes happen. They build bridges on land that is more stable and does not move much during an earthquake, so the bridges are safer.",

        "feedback_text": "The writer's output maintains full factual integrity with accurate representation of the original text's key information, such as the role of earthquakes in causing structural damage, the infrequency of modern bridge collapses, and engineers' efforts in designing bridges on stable land in earthquake zones. Both the MeaningBERT score of 0.7777 and BERTScore of 0.9053 exceed the required thresholds, indicating good preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity from the source. The CEFR classification as B1 is accurate, reflecting the text's appropriate complexity, vocabulary, and sentence structure. The output uses explanatory elaborations to define potentially unfamiliar concepts like 'earthquakes' and 'engineers' suitably for B1 readers, enhancing comprehension without oversimplifying. The text flows well with clear and logical sentence variety, employing accessible connectors and expansions that maintain coherence. Vocabulary candidates were handled correctly, with careful inclusion of defined keywords at appropriate levels. For further improvement, consider slightly more concise phrasing to avoid minor redundancy (e.g., explaining basic bridge function twice) and ensure tighter sentence construction to enhance fluency. Overall, the simplification meets the task requirements effectively and communicates the intended scientific information clearly and accurately for B1 learners.",
