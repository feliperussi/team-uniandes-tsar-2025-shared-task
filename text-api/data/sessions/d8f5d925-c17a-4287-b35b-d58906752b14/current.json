Bridges are strong structures that help people and vehicles cross rivers or roads. Luckily, bridges falling down because of earthquakes does not happen very often, especially with modern bridges. Engineers, who are people trained to design and build structures, have learned how to make bridges in places where earthquakes happen. They build bridges on land that is more stable and does not move much during an earthquake, so the bridges are safer.",
