    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets the minimum requirements for A2. It is factually accurate, preserves the core meaning (MeaningBERT 0.82, BERTScore 0.91), and correctly classifies as A2. The sentence structure is exemplary, using short, simple sentences. However, the submission is not perfect.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The text uses the B1-level words 'priest' and 'baker'. For strict A2 compliance, any vocabulary above the target level must be identified as a keyword and defined in simple A2 terms. This was not done.\n\nSuggestion: Identify 'priest' and 'baker' as keywords. Provide simple definitions. For example: 'priest (a leader in the Christian church)' and 'baker (a person who makes bread)'. Adherence to this rule is mandatory for a higher grade.",
