        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6658 is well below the required 0.75. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8711 is also below the 0.90 threshold, showing a failure to retain key factual words.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text is about Pi's interest in specific religions: Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. By changing \"a Christian priest\" to \"a church leader\" and \"a Muslim baker\" to \"a bread maker\", you have removed the essential information. The text is no longer about exploring different named religions, which was the central point.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word \"means\" is a B2-level word and is not permitted. The sentence \"Himself means the same boy\" is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n- Structural Failure: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text choppy and unnatural. For example, \"Pi says he is Hindu. He also says he is Muslim. He also says he is Christian.\" should be a single, connected idea.\n- Poor Style: Definitions like \"A surprise is something you did not expect\" are embedded directly into the narrative. This is poor writing and disrupts the flow of the story. Definitions must be handled separately or integrated naturally.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by re-inserting the words \"Christian\" and \"Muslim\". Combine overly short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and'. Remove the B2 word \"means\". Do not write definitions as standalone sentences within the text. The goal is simplification, not the complete removal of essential facts.",

The text fails because it includes multiple words that are above the A2 CEFR level without simplification.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The words 'curious', 'priest', and 'baker' are classified as B1 level. An A2 text must not use B1 vocabulary. These words were included directly from the original text without being replaced by simpler A2 alternatives.\n- Structural Flaw: The sentence 'He says no and says I just want to love God' is structurally weak due to the repetition of the verb 'says'. This construction is unclear and should be simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'curious' with an A2 phrase like 'wants to know about'. Replace 'priest' with a simple description like 'a Christian church leader'. Replace 'baker' with 'a person who makes bread'. Rephrase the repetitive sentence to 'He says no. He tells them, I just want to love God'.",

This indicates a critical loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n\n-   Primary Deviation: The text fails to preserve specific factual details. The original identifies Pi's friends as a \"Christian priest\" and a \"Muslim baker\". Your version simplifies this to \"a man from a church\" and \"a person who makes bread\". This simplification removes the specific religious context of his friends, which is a key detail in the original passage and the direct cause of the low BERTScore.\n-   Structural Issue: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. This makes it choppy and unnatural. While simplicity is required, the complete lack of basic connectors like 'and' or 'but' is excessive.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost factual details. Do not remove specific identifiers like \"Christian\" and \"Muslim\". Rephrase the sentence to include this information while maintaining A2 simplicity. Example: \"He becomes friends with a Christian man from the church and a Muslim baker.\" Combine the sentences \"He says no\" and \"He tells them...\" for better flow. Example: \"He says no and tells them, 'I just want to love God'.\"",
