The text fails to preserve the core concepts of the original.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states humans became \"more complex and more intelligent.\" Your output reduces this to \"smarter,\" completely losing the critical concept of increasing complexity. This is a severe meaning shift.\n- Secondary Deviation: The original text questions if \"more complex brains\" led to language. Your output changes this to \"better brains.\" \"Better\" is an inaccurate and overly simplistic substitution for \"complex\" in this context.\n- Factual Simplification Error: The specific time frame \"Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago\" is a key piece of data. Replacing it with the vague phrase \"A long time ago\" removes essential context and contributes to the low meaning preservation score.\n\nSuggestion: You must reintroduce the concept of complexity. Rephrase the sentence to something like: \"But people became smarter and their lives became more complex.\" Change \"better brains\" to a phrase that captures the original meaning, such as \"brains that could think in new ways.\"",

MeaningBERT score (0.7996) and BERTScore (0.9081) confirm meaning and fidelity are preserved. The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The keyword 'civilisation' is defined using simple A2 terms, which is correct procedure.\n- Structure: The text correctly uses short sentences and basic A2 connectors such as 'but', 'and', and 'so'.\n\nDiagnostic Note: The sentence 'We do not know if this is because of language' approaches the upper boundary of A2 complexity by combining an indirect question with a causal phrase. While acceptable, it is a point of potential improvement.\n\nSuggestion: For absolute A2 compliance, deconstruct such sentences. For example: 'We do not know the reason. Was it because of language?' This removes all structural ambiguity.",

Connectors are limited to A2-appropriate words like 'and', 'but', and 'so'. The complex question from the original text has been successfully broken down into two simple, direct questions.\n- Keyword Definition: The keyword 'civilisation' was correctly identified and defined at the beginning of the text using simple A2 vocabulary.
