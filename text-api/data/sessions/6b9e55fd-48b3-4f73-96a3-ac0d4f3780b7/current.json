For example, people made paintings in caves. We do not know the reason. Was it because of language?\nPeople's brains did not suddenly get bigger. But people became smarter and their lives were not simple.\nSo we have a question. Did using language help their brains to change and work better? Or did their brains change first and then start to make language?",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, dates, and the core message from the original text are accurately preserved. No discrepancies were found.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7504 and BERTScore of 0.9096 meet the required thresholds, confirming successful preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The B1 keyword 'civilisation' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms at the beginning of the text, which is exemplary practice.\n- Structural Simplicity: Sentence structures are consistently simple and short. Connectors used ('and', 'but', 'so', 'because', 'or') are appropriate for the A2 level. The complex question from the original was successfully broken down into two simpler, more accessible questions.",
