The word 'treat' in the sentence 'So people treat them like things you use once' is not on the A2 word list. A2 compliance requires strict adherence to the approved lexicon. While the text successfully maintains factual integrity, meaning, and uses appropriate A2 sentence structures, this single vocabulary violation constitutes a critical failure. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence to eliminate the B1 word. Use a construction like 'So people use these clothes only a few times' or 'For people, these clothes are like things you use once and throw away'.",

The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The core facts from the original text are fully preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8566 and BERTScore of 0.9195 are well above the minimum thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. Sentence structures are simple, short, and use appropriate A2-level connectors ('and', 'so'). The simplification of 'disposable items' to 'things you use once' is a model of effective A2 rephrasing. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
