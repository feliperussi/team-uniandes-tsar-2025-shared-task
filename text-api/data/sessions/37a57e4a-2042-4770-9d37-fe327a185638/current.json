The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The core facts from the original text are fully preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8566 and BERTScore of 0.9195 are well above the minimum thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. Sentence structures are simple, short, and use appropriate A2-level connectors ('and', 'so'). The simplification of 'disposable items' to 'things you use once' is a model of effective A2 rephrasing. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
