    "text_translated": "An asteroid is a big rock in space. Now NASA is trying to find smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or bigger. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. Until now, they found about 8,000. So, they still need to find 17,000. This is important because a small asteroid broke into pieces over a city in Russia in 2013. That asteroid was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. These bigger asteroids are a very serious danger if they come near Earth.",
