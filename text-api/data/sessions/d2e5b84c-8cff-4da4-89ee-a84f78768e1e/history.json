NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. Until now, they found about 8,000. So, they still need to find 17,000. This is important because a small asteroid exploded over a city in Russia in 2013. That asteroid was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. These bigger asteroids are a very serious danger if they come near Earth.",

        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates the 'No Excuses' rule. The verb 'exploded' is B1 level. The text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary. While the simplification of 'injured' (B1) to 'hurt' (A1/A2) is correct, and the sentence structures are appropriate for A2, the use of a single B1 verb results in an immediate failure. The definition of the keyword 'asteroid' is well-executed, but this does not excuse the vocabulary violation."

Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. Complex concepts like 'exploded' and 'enter Earth's orbit' are expertly simplified to 'broke into pieces' and 'come near Earth' using A2 vocabulary. The text fully adheres to all criteria."
