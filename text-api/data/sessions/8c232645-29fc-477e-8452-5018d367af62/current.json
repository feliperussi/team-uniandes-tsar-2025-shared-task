She saw a child from another country playing with it, and she watched, but she felt sad, because in her country, people thought that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world who has climbed the Seven Summits, such as Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to have used a hula hoop on the top of each of these mountains, and her reason for doing this was to help women and girls in her country feel strong and confident, because in Bangladesh, they are often told not to do sport.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - No factual errors were found. The output accurately reflects all information presented in the original text.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.7672 is above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.939 is well above the 0.90 threshold, demonstrating strong lexical and factual fidelity to the original.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis -\nThe simplification strategy is highly effective. The writer successfully simplified complex vocabulary and sentence structures while maintaining the original meaning and flow.\nKeywords: The keyword 'hula hoop' was clearly and appropriately defined within the text, which is excellent for B1 comprehension.\nVocabulary Candidates: The writer made excellent choices in simplifying vocabulary. For example, 'came across' was simplified to 'saw', 'reluctantly stood by' to 'watched, but she felt sad', 'empower' to 'help...feel strong and confident', and 'discourages' to 'are often told not to do sport'. These changes effectively reduce the linguistic complexity to a B1 level without losing nuance.\nStructure and Flow: The text maintains a natural and coherent flow. Connectors like 'and', 'but', 'because', and 'now' are used effectively to link ideas, making the text easy to follow for a B1 learner. Sentence variety is good, preventing monotony.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong simplification that meets all requirements with high quality. The text is clear, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the B1 CEFR level.",
