The MeaningBERT score of 0.5896 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8817 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant deviation from the original's key terminology and phrasing. Specific deviations include: The original's formal 'recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style' was overly simplified to 'We think Girox Foods should change. It should lead its workers in a better way. This way is more about people.', losing the specific concept of a 'management style' and the formal 'recommendation'. Key terms like 'management style', 'explore ways of offering', 'consider how we can enable', 'positive reinforcement and recognition', 'increased investment', 'professional development', 'social and and intercultural communication', and 'contribute to creating a positive environment' were broken down into simpler, less precise phrases, leading to a loss of lexical detail and contributing to the low BERTScore. For example, 'professional development' became 'worker training. This training is for their jobs.', and 'social and intercultural communication' became 'talking to people. It is also for talking to people from other countries.'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the current approach sacrifices too much of the original's specific meaning and lexical content. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific concepts, even if simplified. For instance, 'management style' could be 'how managers lead people'. Ensure that the core ideas of 'recommendation', 'exploration of ways', and 'specific types of communication' are more clearly conveyed, even with A2 vocabulary.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6167 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a formal recommendation based on findings, suggesting exploration and consideration of strategic changes. Your version simplifies this to a series of direct, almost prescriptive actions, losing the nuance of a strategic recommendation and the underlying rationale. The tone and implied formality of the original are entirely lost.\n\nFAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8818 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Phrases like 'On the basis of these findings', 'adopt a more people-oriented management style', 'explore ways of offering', 'consider how we can enable', 'a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition', and 'could also contribute to creating a positive environment' were replaced with overly simplified or different lexical choices, reducing the lexical overlap and precision.\n\nDeviation 1: MeaningBERT Score. The core message regarding the strategic nature of the recommendations and the exploratory language ('explore ways', 'consider how') was diluted. The original's 'recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style' is a strategic directive, whereas 'We advise Girox Foods. They should lead their workers in a new way. This way is more about people' is a much weaker, less formal statement.\n\nDeviation 2: BERTScore. Significant lexical divergence from the original text. For example, 'On the basis of these findings' was replaced with 'We looked at some facts', and 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was simplified to 'say 'good job' more. They must praise workers for their work'. While simplified, these changes reduce the lexical fidelity.\n\nDeviation 3: Vocabulary. The word 'flexible' (B2) was used in the output ('flexible hours'). This word is above the A2 CEFR level and requires simplification or an A2-level definition.\n\nDeviation 4: Vocabulary. The word 'advise' (B1) was used in the output ('We advise Girox Foods'). While 'recommend' (B1) was in the original, 'advise' is still a B1 word and should be simplified for an A2 audience, for example, to 'We think Girox Foods should...' or 'We tell Girox Foods to...'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the entire text to ensure that while simplifying, the core strategic intent and the specific nuances of the original message are preserved. Focus on maintaining the original's tone of recommendation and exploration. Replace B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 alternatives or provide clear A2 definitions within the sentence structure. Ensure that key phrases are simplified without losing their essential meaning or lexical connection to the original.",

Deviation: The concept of 'challenge our staff' was simplified to 'give workers new tasks. These tasks should be interesting.' This removes the developmental aspect of 'challenge' and replaces it with a generic 'new tasks'. Deviation: 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' was oversimplified to 'say 'good job' more. They must show they see the workers' good work.' This reduces a broad management strategy to basic verbal praise, losing the depth of 'reinforcement' and 'recognition'. Deviation: The use of repetitive phrasing like 'Workers can choose when to work. Workers can choose where to work.' while simple, dilutes the conciseness of the original and does not fully capture the 'enable employees' aspect.

The BERTScore of 0.8804 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below. \n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The opening phrase 'On the basis of these findings, we recommend that...' is entirely omitted. This fundamentally alters the purpose and tone of the text from a formal recommendation based on evidence to a simple statement of opinion, losing a critical aspect of the original meaning. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: The phrase 'people-oriented management style' is simplified to 'lead people by thinking about them more'. While simpler, it loses the specific management terminology. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: 'Flexible working hours' is simplified to 'choose their work times'. This is a less precise term. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: 'Challenge our staff' is rephrased as 'give workers many tasks. These tasks should help workers learn and grow'. This interpretation is acceptable for A2 but loses the direct lexical connection. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: 'Positive reinforcement and recognition' is broken down into 'tell workers when they do well. They must show they value workers' good work'. This is a functional simplification but loses the specific terminology. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: 'Professional development' is simplified to 'training for workers' jobs'. This is a significant reduction in the scope and formality of the original term. \n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: 'Social and intercultural communication' is simplified to 'talking with people. It is also for talking with people from other countries'. This is an overly simplistic breakdown that loses the specific concept of 'communication' as a skill and 'intercultural' as a specific domain. \n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce the concept of a recommendation based on findings. Ensure that key terms, even when simplified, retain more of their original professional context and specific meaning. For example, 'flexible working hours' could be 'times to work that they can choose'. 'Professional development' could be 'training to get better at their jobs'.",

The CEFR classifier result of A2 is irrelevant as the text failed at a higher priority. \n\n*   The original's 'people-oriented management style' is reduced to 'manage people with workers in mind', which loses the strategic and holistic nature of 'adopting a style'. The nuance of 'oriented' is lost. \n*   'challenge our staff' is simplified to 'give workers hard tasks', which alters the positive connotation of professional growth to a more literal and potentially negative interpretation of difficulty. \n*   'positive reinforcement and recognition' is fragmented into 'tell workers when they do well. They must show they see workers' good work', losing the integrated concept of continuous support and acknowledgement. \n*   'professional development' is oversimplified to 'training for workers' jobs', which narrows the scope of growth opportunities. \n*   The overall tone shifts from a professional recommendation to a series of overly simplistic and blunt statements, fundamentally altering the communicative intent and register of the original. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the concept of 'people-oriented management style' by focusing on 'managing in a way that helps workers'. Ensure 'challenge our staff' implies growth and learning, not just difficulty. Combine the ideas of 'telling workers when they do well' and 'showing they see good work' into a more cohesive phrase like 'praise their good work'. Use 'training to help workers learn and grow' to better reflect 'professional development'. Maintain a more advisory and less instructional tone.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5982 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's core meaning and nuance. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8911 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key lexical items and factual phrasing from the original text. The output is an oversimplification that loses the formal, recommendatory tone and specific concepts of the original. Specific deviations include: The opening 'On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style' was reduced to 'We looked at the facts. We think Girox Foods should manage people in a way that helps workers.' This loses the formal recommendation, the concept of 'findings,' and the specific 'people-oriented management style.' The phrase 'explore ways of offering more flexible working hours' was simplified to 'find ways for workers to choose their work times,' losing the active 'explore' and the specific term 'flexible working hours.' 'Enable employees to work from their chosen locations' was reduced to 'think about where workers can choose to work,' losing 'enable' and 'locations.' 'Consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition' was simplified to 'give workers hard tasks to help them get better. They should praise workers for their good work,' losing the nuance of 'variety of ways,' 'positive reinforcement,' and 'recognition.' 'Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication' was simplified to 'spend more money on training to help workers learn and grow. This training helps workers talk well with people. It also helps them talk well with people from other countries,' losing the specific terms 'increased investment,' 'professional development,' and the precise phrasing of 'social and intercultural communication.'

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required thresholds for both meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6165 is significantly below the required 0.75. While the individual points from the original text are present, the overall semantic coherence and professional tone are lost in the overly simplistic and fragmented rephrasing. For example, the original's cohesive idea of 'could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work' is broken into two separate, less connected sentences: 'This can make a good place to work. Workers can then do their best work.' This fragmentation reduces the overall semantic density and connection. The BERTScore of 0.8935 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Many specific and professional terms were replaced with overly simple or generic phrases. For instance, 'adopt a more people-oriented management style' was simplified to 'manage people in a 'people-first' way', 'explore ways of offering' to 'look for ways to give', 'challenge our staff' to 'give workers new tasks. These tasks should make workers think', and 'social and intercultural communication' to 'talk well with people from other countries'. While these are A2 simplifications, they deviate too much from the original's lexical content to meet the fidelity requirement. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to maintain a higher degree of semantic and lexical fidelity while still adhering to A2 complexity. Ensure that key concepts are not fragmented or overly generalized. For example, try to keep more of the original's specific vocabulary where possible, or find A2 synonyms that are closer in meaning and register.",
