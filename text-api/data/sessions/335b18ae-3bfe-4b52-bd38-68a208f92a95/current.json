    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6986 is below the required 0.75. The core message regarding 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was significantly diluted. The original text suggests a structured approach to encouraging and acknowledging employee work, but your version simplifies this to merely 'praise staff for their good work'. This simplification loses the specific nuances of 'reinforcement' (encouraging specific behaviors) and 'recognition' (formal acknowledgment), which are distinct from general 'praise'. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the concepts of both 'positive reinforcement' and 'recognition' using A2-level vocabulary, perhaps by breaking them down into simpler actions.",
