This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Diagnostic Finding: The original text states the games are used to 'remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. Your version separates this into two weaker statements: 'It uses the games to punish other parts of the country' and 'The districts fought the Capitol in the past'. This separation breaks the direct causal link and loses the critical concept of the games being a constant 'reminder'.\n\n- Secondary Violation (Vocabulary): The text fails to adhere to the A2 vocabulary standard. You used multiple B1-level words directly from the original text without simplification. This is a critical error. The words 'punish', 'district', 'lottery', and 'battle' are not A2-compliant.\n\n- Secondary Violation (Keywords): The keyword 'tributes' was not defined. You stated the name but did not explain what it means in simple A2 terms.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the core meaning. The connection between the punishment and the past rebellion must be explicit. Example: 'The Capitol uses the games to show the districts they are still being punished because they fought a war in the past.'\n\n- Suggestion: Replace all B1 vocabulary. 'punish' must be rephrased. 'district' must be simplified. 'lottery' and 'battle' must be explained or replaced with simpler A2 concepts like 'a game of chance' and 'a big fight'.",

'Must' is a weaker term of obligation.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the original meaning. Use simple A2 language to explain the concept of 'punishment'.

This separation damages the direct causal link.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the entire concept of punishment and reminder using only A2 vocabulary. Do not use the words 'punishment' or 'remind'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6153 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text states the games are used to 'remind the districts that they are being punished'. Your version only states the Capitol uses the games to 'punish the areas'. The crucial concept of the games as a constant, annual 'reminder' has been completely lost. This is a severe deviation in meaning.\n\n- Structural Failure: The original text uses a subordinate clause ('which the Capitol uses...') to create a strong, direct link between the event and its purpose. Your text breaks this into four separate, simple sentences. This disjointed structure weakens the cause-and-effect relationship and contributed to the low meaning preservation score.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'punish' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary. An A2-compliant text must not use B1 words.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning of 'reminder'. Rephrase to explain that the Capitol wants the areas to remember they were wrong. Replace the B1 word 'punish' with an A2-level explanation, such as 'to show the areas that the Capitol is in control'.",
