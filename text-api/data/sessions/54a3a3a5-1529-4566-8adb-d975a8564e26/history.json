This weakens the description and loses the original's emphasis on the story's unique and unbelievable nature.\n- The term 'shipwrecked' implies a disaster. Your phrase 'His boat sinks' is factually correct but lacks the same dramatic meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning.

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary issue is the over-simplification of the first sentence.

Your version breaks this into a series of disconnected facts: 'His big boat sinks... He is trapped... A very dangerous tiger is on the boat with him.' This fragmentation weakens the crucial link between the events, causing a loss of the story's central premise and resulting in the low meaning score. Suggestion: Rephrase to connect the key events. The sentence structure must show that being trapped with the tiger is a direct result of the boat sinking. Use a simple connector like 'after' or 'and so' to link these ideas more strongly.",

Your output breaks this narrative into a series of short, disconnected sentences like 'His name is Pi. His big boat sinks. After this, he is trapped...'. This excessive fragmentation destroys the narrative flow and alters the meaning from a single extraordinary event to a simple list of facts. While individual word choices like simplifying 'diplomat' to 'father had an important job for his country' are appropriate for A2, the overall sentence structure is too simplistic and choppy, causing the critical meaning preservation failure. Suggestion: Combine short sentences to restore the narrative connection. For example, instead of three separate sentences, try 'The story is about a boy from India named Pi, and he is trapped on a small boat after his big boat sinks.' This better reflects the original meaning.",
