    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about genes. We want to know how they work with our brain and language. Did some genes change and help us to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. DNA is the material in our body that has all our genes. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",
