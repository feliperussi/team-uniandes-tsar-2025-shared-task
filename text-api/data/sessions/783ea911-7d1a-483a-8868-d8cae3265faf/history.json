        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, which is too complex for A2 level. Specifically, the sentence 'Wild animals live in nature, not at home.' is fine, but expressions like 'A newspaper is a book with news.' and 'Reports are stories in the newspaper or on TV that tell us what happens.' introduce abstract definition structures that go beyond A2. The word 'lately' (B1 level) is used, which violates the A2 vocabulary constraint. Also, some sentences are longer and include subordinations such as 'Do they like them or think they can cause danger or are pests?' which is too complicated and contains a conjunction string uncommon at A2. Although the factual content is mostly preserved and BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores pass, the language complexity and vocabulary breach A2 standards. Suggestion: Remove B1 vocabulary like 'lately'. Simplify sentence structures by splitting compound sentences. Avoid abstract explanations like 'A newspaper is a book with news.' Keep sentences short, concrete, and rely only on A2 vocabulary and connectors (and, but, so, because).",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score is 0.6349, well below the required 0.75 minimal threshold, indicating that the essential message of the original text was not preserved adequately. Your text dilutes the original focus on the growing appearances of wild animals in cities with multiple explanations (such as 'The press is newspapers and TV channels') that interrupt the flow and shift emphasis. The original's core concern about the implications of bigger wild animals coming into cities and how they are perceived is simplified but also fragmented, losing the overall meaning. Additionally, the original mentions a clear escalation ('in bigger and bigger numbers') which your version omits entirely, reducing the urgency and scale of the issue. The introduction of definitions like 'The press is newspapers and TV channels' is unnecessary and detracts from core content. Despite the BERTScore of 0.91 meeting requirements, the low MeaningBERT and diluted meaning must be corrected. CEFR classification is correctly A2, but this does not offset the loss of core meaning. Suggestion: Restore the focus on the increase in wild animal sightings and their varying receptions by people. Remove in-text dictionary-style definitions. Keep sentences focused on the main thematic concern without digressions. Simplify while preserving the original central message and progression.",
