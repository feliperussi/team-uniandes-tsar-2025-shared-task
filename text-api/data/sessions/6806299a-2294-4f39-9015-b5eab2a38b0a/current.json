She was born in a neighbourhood in Glasgow that had the highest crime level, so she learned to stay quiet, avoid trouble, and even how to open car doors with a knife. Fortunately, she only used this skill to write her novels. Today, she is no longer quiet. She appears on popular daytime programmes such as Police Today and at writing conferences all over the UK.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all names, locations, and key actions correctly transferred. The MeaningBERT (0.91) and BERTScore (0.95) are excellent, indicating that the core message and key phrasing were preserved with high fidelity. The text correctly achieves the B1 CEFR target. The simplification strategies used are highly effective: the long final sentence of the original was expertly split into three shorter, clearer sentences, which significantly improves readability for a B1 audience. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'housing estate' to 'neighbourhood' and 'stay out of trouble' to 'avoid trouble', are precise and appropriate for the target level. The final output is clear, fluent, and an excellent model of B1 simplification.",
