You are like a film director.\nThen, you do not just understand your dreams. You make them. But maybe you want to keep some dreams. These dreams let your brain tell you things.",

    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed with exemplary results. The text maintains factual integrity, meaning, and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2, and a deep qualitative audit confirms strict adherence to A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected. The simplification of complex concepts like 'open your mind to lucid dreaming' to 'help them have lucid dreams' and 'subconscious to tell you what's on your mind' to 'brain tell you things' is perfectly executed for the A2 level. The use of connectors like 'So', 'Then', 'But', 'where', and 'what' (as a pronoun) is appropriate for A2. The vocabulary 'control', 'director', and 'brain' are correctly identified as A2 and used appropriately.",
