    "feedback": "The output successfully passes all primary checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.96) are both excellent, indicating that the core message and key terms were well-preserved. The vocabulary choices are appropriate for the B1 level. The primary area for improvement is sentence structure. The final sentence, 'Many street artists have been stopped by the police, and some have to pay fines, and city councils also complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti from buildings, buses and trains,' is a run-on sentence connected by 'and... and...'. For better clarity and flow, this should be split into two sentences: 'Many street artists have been stopped by the police and some have to pay fines. City councils also complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti...'",
