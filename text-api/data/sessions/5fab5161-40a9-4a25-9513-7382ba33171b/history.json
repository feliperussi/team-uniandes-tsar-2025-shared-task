These are asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far. This means 17,000 of them are still missing. This is a serious problem because even a small asteroid can be dangerous. For example, an asteroid that was only 19 metres wide exploded over a city in Russia in 2013. It injured 1,200 people. Therefore, these bigger asteroids would be a very serious danger if they come near Earth.",

Sentence 4 ('Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far.') is 21 words long. Sentence 7 is 19 words long. These must be shortened. The final sentence uses an incorrect conditional structure ('would be... if they come'). This is grammatically unclear. The word 'Therefore' is B2 level and too advanced."
