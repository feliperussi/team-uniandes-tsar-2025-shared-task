    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks, demonstrating excellent factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.86), and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.94). The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary, replacing terms like 'increased awareness' with 'more knowledge' and 'detrimental' with 'bad', which are appropriate for the B1 level. Sentence structures were also skillfully adapted; for instance, 'it is vital that we also remember' was simplified to 'it is very important that we also remember'. The use of B1 connectors such as 'But', 'Even though', and 'For this reason' maintains excellent coherence and flow. The keyword 'stereotypes' was correctly retained, indicating its importance for the target audience. This is a very strong simplification.",
