        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6932 is below the required 0.75 threshold. While the text generally maintains the core ideas, the introduction of explicit definitions for 'stereotypes' (e.g., 'which are fixed ideas about how all people from a country or group are') and 'gender' (e.g., 'whether we are male or female') adds new semantic content that was not explicitly present in the original text's concise phrasing. This can cause a deviation in the overall semantic similarity as measured by MeaningBERT. Additionally, some nuanced phrases like 'increased awareness' simplified to 'Knowing about' and 'keep at the back of our minds' simplified to 'keep... in our minds' might have subtly altered the original's emphasis or idiomatic expression, contributing to the lower score. To improve, focus on simplifying existing content without adding new explanatory phrases unless absolutely necessary, and ensure that idiomatic expressions are replaced with semantically equivalent, simpler phrases that fully capture the original's nuance.",

The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary, replacing terms like 'increased awareness' with 'more knowledge' and 'detrimental' with 'bad', which are appropriate for the B1 level. Sentence structures were also skillfully adapted; for instance, 'it is vital that we also remember' was simplified to 'it is very important that we also remember'. The use of B1 connectors such as 'But', 'Even though', and 'For this reason' maintains excellent coherence and flow. The keyword 'stereotypes' was correctly retained, indicating its importance for the target audience. This is a very strong simplification.",
