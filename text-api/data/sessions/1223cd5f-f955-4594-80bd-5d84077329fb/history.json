This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text uses the word 'Though' to establish a logical connection: despite the extreme danger, the best climbers seek new challenges. Your version separates these two ideas into disconnected sentences: 'Climbing high mountains is very dangerous... But the best climbers in the world now want new things to do.' This separation breaks the cause-and-effect relationship and weakens the original meaning. While vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with A2 standards, the loss of this critical logical link is a severe error. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the logical connection. A sentence like 'Climbing is dangerous, but the best climbers still want new challenges' would better preserve the original meaning while remaining at an A2 level.",

MeaningBERT score of 0.77 and BERTScore of 0.94 exceed the minimum thresholds, indicating successful preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: Verified. The classifier result is A2. The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1/A2 lexicon.\n- Structural Analysis: Verified. Complex sentences from the source text have been correctly deconstructed into simple, declarative sentences appropriate for the A2 level. Connectors ('because', 'but') are used correctly within A2 constraints.\nThe submission is a textbook example of successful simplification. No corrections are necessary.",
