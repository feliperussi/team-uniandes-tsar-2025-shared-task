    "feedback": "PASS. The output meets all requirements of the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: Verified. All data points from the original text, including numbers (4,000), ages (13-80), and names (Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner), are accurately represented.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: Verified. MeaningBERT score of 0.77 and BERTScore of 0.94 exceed the minimum thresholds, indicating successful preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: Verified. The classifier result is A2. The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1/A2 lexicon.\n- Structural Analysis: Verified. Complex sentences from the source text have been correctly deconstructed into simple, declarative sentences appropriate for the A2 level. Connectors ('because', 'but') are used correctly within A2 constraints.\nThe submission is a textbook example of successful simplification. No corrections are necessary.",
