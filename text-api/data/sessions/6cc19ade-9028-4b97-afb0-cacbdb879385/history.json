But in the last few years, newspapers and TV news talk a lot about wild animals. More and more wild animals are coming into cities. People saw bears in parks in Vancouver. They saw leopards on the streets of Mumbai. And they saw wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when these bigger animals come into our cities? Do people like them? Or do people think they are a danger or a problem?",

The vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range, with excellent simplifications like 'pest' to 'problem' and 'recent years' to 'last few years'. Sentence structures are simple, direct, and use basic tenses. The text maintains perfect factual accuracy while simplifying the original content. No corrections are needed. This is the benchmark for A2 writing."
