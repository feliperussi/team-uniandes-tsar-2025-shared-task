    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8477) and BERTScore (0.9089) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and key lexical content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating effective targeting of the desired complexity level. The simplification strategy is highly effective. Complex sentences from the original text have been skillfully broken down into shorter, more manageable units, significantly improving readability for a B1 audience. For example, the original's single sentence 'With technology already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impact, at which point two defence solutions could be launched' was transformed into four clear, concise sentences. Vocabulary simplification is also well-executed; terms like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' were appropriately simplified to 'Possibly Dangerous Asteroids', and 'defence solutions' became 'ways to protect Earth'. The keyword 'asteroid' was clearly defined, which is crucial for B1 comprehension. The overall flow is natural, and the use of B1 connectors is appropriate. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
