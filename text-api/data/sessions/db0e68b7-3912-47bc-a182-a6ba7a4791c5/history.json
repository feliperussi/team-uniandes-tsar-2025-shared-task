While the simplification attempts are good, several elements contribute to this higher classification. The phrase 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is retained, and the word 'Potentially' is a B2-level vocabulary item. The verb 'predict' is used, which is typically a B2-level word. Additionally, the verb 'launched' is a B2-level word. The sentence 'it is not believed that any of them will be a danger' uses a more complex passive construction ('it is believed that') which is characteristic of B2. To achieve a B1 level, consider replacing 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' with a simpler, more descriptive phrase after its initial definition, such as 'these dangerous space rocks'. Simplify 'predict' to 'say what will happen' or 'guess'. Replace 'launched' with 'sent out' or 'started'. Rephrase 'it is not believed that' to 'people do not think that' or 'we do not think that'.",

While the text successfully preserved factual integrity (Priority 1) and maintained meaning and fidelity (Priority 2, MeaningBERT 0.8653, BERTScore 0.91), its linguistic complexity exceeds the B1 target. This is primarily due to the length and structure of several sentences, which combine multiple clauses and more advanced grammatical constructions. For example, the sentence 'NASA can watch these objects using technology that is already available, and they can also say what will happen if there is a possible hit' is quite long and includes a participial phrase ('using technology that is already available') and a noun clause ('what will happen if there is a possible hit'), which collectively push it beyond a typical B1 structure. Similarly, 'These asteroids can pass quite close to Earth, less than 7.5 million kilometres from our planet's path in space' uses a complex prepositional phrase and overall length that leans towards B2. To achieve B1, consider splitting longer sentences into two or more simpler sentences, and rephrasing complex clauses to be more direct. For instance, 'what will happen if there is a possible hit' could be simplified to 'what might happen if an asteroid hits'.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8477) and BERTScore (0.9089) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the core message and key lexical content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating effective targeting of the desired complexity level. The simplification strategy is highly effective. Complex sentences from the original text have been skillfully broken down into shorter, more manageable units, significantly improving readability for a B1 audience. For example, the original's single sentence 'With technology already available, NASA can track these objects and make predictions about possible impact, at which point two defence solutions could be launched' was transformed into four clear, concise sentences. Vocabulary simplification is also well-executed; terms like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' were appropriately simplified to 'Possibly Dangerous Asteroids', and 'defence solutions' became 'ways to protect Earth'. The keyword 'asteroid' was clearly defined, which is crucial for B1 comprehension. The overall flow is natural, and the use of B1 connectors is appropriate. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
