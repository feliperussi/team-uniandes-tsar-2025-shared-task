The writer's output introduces new information not present in the original text, specifically 'A baboon is a big monkey. It lives in Africa.' The task is to simplify the provided text, not to add general knowledge. This addition fundamentally alters the scope and focus of the original message. Additionally, the word 'orchards' was omitted from the original phrase 'gardens and orchards', which is a factual omission. The MeaningBERT score of 0.667 is below the required 0.75, confirming a failure to preserve the core message. The added introductory sentences shift the focus from the baboons' specific behavior in Cape Town to a general description of baboons, thus altering the original meaning.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6336 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a failure to fully preserve the core message of the original text. This is a critical deviation from the required standard. The BERTScore of 0.9458 is acceptable, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, but the fundamental meaning has been compromised. Specific deviations are detailed below:  - Meaning Preservation: The core message regarding the baboons' specific behavior and the nuanced reason for residents' unwelcoming stance has been diluted. The original text describes baboons as 'aggressive', which denotes a specific, proactive, and hostile behavior. Your output replaces this with 'dangerous'. While baboons can be dangerous, 'dangerous' is a broader consequence, not the specific behavioral trait of 'aggression'. This substitution loses a key aspect of the problem described in the original.  - Meaning Preservation: The original text uses 'understandably' to subtly convey a logical and self-evident conclusion regarding the residents' feelings. Your output replaces this with the more explicit and less nuanced phrase 'So, it is easy to understand'. This alters the causal flow and the naturalness of the conclusion, further contributing to the meaning loss.  Suggestion: Rephrase the problematic sentences to accurately convey the specific behavioral trait of 'aggression' and the subtle, logical connection between the baboons' actions and the residents' reaction, while still adhering to A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. Do not sacrifice core meaning for simplification.",

While the text successfully simplifies vocabulary and structure for A2, it loses critical semantic connections and the overall coherence present in the original. For example, the original text states 'Often wild animals come into cities to look for food', clearly linking the action and its purpose. Your version splits this into 'Wild animals often come into cities. They look for food.', which weakens the direct causal relationship. Similarly, 'baboons have started coming into residential areas on the edge of the city to feed' becomes fragmented into 'baboons started to come to places with houses. These places are at the side of the city. They come to eat.', diluting the direct purpose. The nuanced cause-and-effect in 'Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence' is also weakened by breaking it into multiple, less connected sentences like 'Baboons can fight. They attack many pet animals. So, people do not want them there. This is normal.' The strength and clarity of the original message are diminished by this over-fragmentation. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain clearer causal and purposive links using simple A2 connectors like 'because' or 'so', or by keeping purpose clauses ('to + verb') where appropriate, without excessively fragmenting the core ideas.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and its nuances. The original text explicitly states that the residents' unwelcoming attitude is 'understandably' due to the baboons' aggressive behavior and attacks on pet animals.

The simplification diminishes the depth of the original message.
