    "text_translated": "Understanding that there can be differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid misunderstandings. However, it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes can be bad for building good business relationships. Stereotypes are simple and often unfair ideas about a group of people. Our national culture can influence how we behave and think. However, we are also influenced by many other things, such as the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age and gender, our company's culture, and our own personal experiences. For this reason, we should keep these possible differences in mind, but we should not use them to judge all individuals from an entire country in the same way.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that meets all criteria with distinction. The output passes all priority checks, starting with perfect factual integrity and high scores for meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.85) and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.93). The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The qualitative analysis is also outstanding. The writer skillfully broke down a long, complex sentence into two simpler, well-connected sentences, improving readability. Most impressively, the vocabulary strategy was executed perfectly. The difficult idiom 'to pigeonhole' was expertly simplified to 'to judge... in the same way', and the key term 'stereotypes' was not only used but also clearly defined within the text, which is a critical feature for ensuring B1-level comprehension. This is a model submission.",
