        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This failure is due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'Although our national culture can influence how we behave and think, we are also mostly influenced by the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age and gender, our company's culture, and our own personal experiences' is too long and contains a complex list for a B1 reader. To meet the B1 requirement, long sentences like this should be split into shorter, more direct statements. For instance: 'Our national culture can influence how we behave and think. However, we are also influenced by our region, community, age, gender, and personal experiences.' On a positive note, the submission passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores (MeaningBERT: 0.90, BERTScore: 0.94), and the keyword 'stereotypes' was defined effectively within the text."

The output passes all priority checks, starting with perfect factual integrity and high scores for meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.85) and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.93). The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The qualitative analysis is also outstanding. The writer skillfully broke down a long, complex sentence into two simpler, well-connected sentences, improving readability. Most impressively, the vocabulary strategy was executed perfectly. The difficult idiom 'to pigeonhole' was expertly simplified to 'to judge... in the same way', and the key term 'stereotypes' was not only used but also clearly defined within the text, which is a critical feature for ensuring B1-level comprehension. This is a model submission."
