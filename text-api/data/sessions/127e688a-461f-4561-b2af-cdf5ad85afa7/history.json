      "content": "Text saved: Suzanne Collins got an important idea for her book, The Hunger Games, from her love of old Greek stories. When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens was ruled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought against them. As a punishment, Minos, who was the king of Crete, made the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were put into a place with many confusing paths, and a monster called the Minotaur ate them. But one of the young people, whose name was Theseus, fought the Minotaur and killed it. Suzanne thinks that Katniss Everdeen is like Theseus, but from the future.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6478 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. The original text states 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology,' emphasizing a deep, foundational influence. The output simplifies this to 'Suzanne Collins got an important idea for her book, The Hunger Games, from her love of old Greek stories.' The word 'idea' does not fully capture the depth of 'inspiration,' and 'old Greek stories' is less specific and impactful than 'classical Greek mythology.' This dilutes the significance of the myth's influence on the book. Additionally, the original's 'The youths are thrown into the labyrinth' conveys a stronger sense of forced peril than the output's 'These young people were put into a place with many confusing paths.' While the latter explains 'labyrinth,' it loses some of the original's evocative language and the sense of being forcibly cast into a dangerous place. To improve, ensure that key concepts like 'inspiration' and specific terminology like 'classical Greek mythology' are retained or rephrased with equivalent semantic weight. For 'labyrinth,' consider a phrase that maintains the sense of being forcibly cast into a dangerous, complex place, rather than merely 'put into' it.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passed all priority checks.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - No factual errors were found. The writer's output accurately reflects all information presented in the original text. Minor additions like 'Collins'' and the full title 'The Hunger Games' are accurate and enhance clarity.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.9452 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9764 is also well above the 0.90 threshold, confirming high lexical and factual fidelity to the original.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The text was correctly classified as 'B1', meeting the target CEFR level. The language used is appropriate for this level, balancing clarity with sufficient detail.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis - The text demonstrates strong B1 compliance.\nStructure and Flow: The sentences are well-structured and flow logically. Connectors like 'When', 'In this story', 'As a punishment', and 'But' are used effectively to maintain coherence.\nVocabulary Strategy: The writer effectively handled vocabulary. The word 'labyrinth' was skillfully simplified by providing a clear, B1-level definition ('a dangerous place with many confusing paths') directly within the sentence, which is an excellent strategy for making complex terms accessible without losing information. Words identified as C1 like 'inspiration' and 'rebel' were kept but are understandable in context for a B1 reader, especially with the clarification 'rebel against them'. No keywords were identified for explicit definition, which is acceptable given the effective simplification strategies employed.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong simplification that maintains all original meaning and factual accuracy while successfully adapting the language to a B1 CEFR level. The strategy for defining 'labyrinth' is particularly commendable.",
