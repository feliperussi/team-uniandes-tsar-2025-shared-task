    "text_translated": "An important inspiration for Suzanne Collins' book, The Hunger Games, comes from her love of classical Greek mythology. When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians rebel against them. As a punishment, Minos, the king of Crete, forces the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The youths are thrown into the labyrinth, a dangerous place with many confusing paths, where a monster called the Minotaur eats them. But one of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - No factual errors were found. The writer's output accurately reflects all information presented in the original text. Minor additions like 'Collins'' and the full title 'The Hunger Games' are accurate and enhance clarity.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.9452 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9764 is also well above the 0.90 threshold, confirming high lexical and factual fidelity to the original.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The text was correctly classified as 'B1', meeting the target CEFR level. The language used is appropriate for this level, balancing clarity with sufficient detail.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis - The text demonstrates strong B1 compliance.\nStructure and Flow: The sentences are well-structured and flow logically. Connectors like 'When', 'In this story', 'As a punishment', and 'But' are used effectively to maintain coherence.\nVocabulary Strategy: The writer effectively handled vocabulary. The word 'labyrinth' was skillfully simplified by providing a clear, B1-level definition ('a dangerous place with many confusing paths') directly within the sentence, which is an excellent strategy for making complex terms accessible without losing information. Words identified as C1 like 'inspiration' and 'rebel' were kept but are understandable in context for a B1 reader, especially with the clarification 'rebel against them'. No keywords were identified for explicit definition, which is acceptable given the effective simplification strategies employed.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong simplification that maintains all original meaning and factual accuracy while successfully adapting the language to a B1 CEFR level. The strategy for defining 'labyrinth' is particularly commendable.",
