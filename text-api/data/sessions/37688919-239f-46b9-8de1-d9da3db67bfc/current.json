    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Now NASA is trying to find smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or more. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, NASA found about 8,000. This means there are still 17,000 to find. This is important. In 2013, a small asteroid broke apart over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a very big danger if they come near Earth.",

    "feedback": "PASS. This is a flawless A2 text. The keyword 'asteroids' is clearly defined at the beginning. Complex vocabulary from the original text such as 'logging', 'estimated', 'exploded', and 'injured' has been perfectly replaced with simple A2 equivalents like 'trying to find', 'thinks there are', 'broke apart', and 'hurt'. Sentence structure is simple, clear, and uses only A2-appropriate grammar. No corrections are needed.",
