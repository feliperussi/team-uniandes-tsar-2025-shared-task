        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to the inclusion of the C1-level word 'diplomat'. The rules are absolute: the text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary. Explaining a complex word is not a valid substitute for using a simpler one, and it violates the core principle of communicating with vocabulary the learner already possesses. This is a critical failure. While the sentence structure and other vocabulary choices are appropriate for A2, this single violation makes the entire output unacceptable."

All complex vocabulary (e.g., 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', 'ferocious', 'diplomat') has been expertly replaced or explained using A1/A2 words. Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and avoid complex grammar like the passive voice ('been translated' correctly became 'People can read it in'). Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No errors found."
