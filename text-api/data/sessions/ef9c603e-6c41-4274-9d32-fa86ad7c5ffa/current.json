    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. All complex vocabulary (e.g., 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', 'ferocious', 'diplomat') has been expertly replaced or explained using A1/A2 words. Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and avoid complex grammar like the passive voice ('been translated' correctly became 'People can read it in'). Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No errors found.",
