    "text_translated": "In the 1950s, banana growers in Central America who sold their fruit commercially were losing their most important banana, the Gros\u202fMichel, also called Big\u202fMike. The same problem is now happening with Big\u202fMike\u2019s next type \u2013 the Cavendish. The Gros\u202fMichel banana had thick skin and a sweet taste. Its fruit could be moved easily, and it was the most common type on Central American plantations. United Fruit was the main grower and exporter in South America at that time. It produced many bananas in an efficient way. It copied shoots from plant stems instead of growing bananas from seeds, and it grew them in very tightly packed fields.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.8481) and BERTScore (0.9334) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is outstanding, particularly the effective breaking down of long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones. For example, the single sentence describing the Gros Michel's characteristics was skillfully split into three easy-to-understand sentences. Vocabulary choices were also excellent, with complex terms like 'dominated' and 'mass-produced' being replaced with clear B1-level equivalents ('was the most common type' and 'produced many bananas'). This is a model submission.",
