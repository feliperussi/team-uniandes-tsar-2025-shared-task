The original text states 'United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time...', but the output incorrectly states 'Joined Fruit, which was the main grower...'. Altering the proper name of a company is a significant violation of factual integrity. Additionally, the output failed the CEFR Compliance check. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the use of complex sentence structures, such as 'The Gros Michel banana, which had fruit that could be moved readily, had thick skin and a sweet taste, and it dominated the plantations of Central America.' To achieve a B1 level, this sentence should be split into two simpler sentences. The use of the C1-level vocabulary word 'readily' also increased the complexity beyond the B1 target.",

First, the sentence structure is too complex for B1. The first and last sentences are very long and contain multiple clauses, such as 'banana growers in Central America who sold their fruit commercially were facing the loss...'. This level of complexity is characteristic of B2. Suggestion: Break these long sentences into shorter, simpler ones. Second, some B2-level vocabulary was retained from the original. The words 'dominated' and 'cultivated' should have been simplified to more common B1 alternatives like 'was the most common type on' and 'grew'.",

The MeaningBERT (0.8481) and BERTScore (0.9334) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is outstanding, particularly the effective breaking down of long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones. For example, the single sentence describing the Gros Michel's characteristics was skillfully split into three easy-to-understand sentences. Vocabulary choices were also excellent, with complex terms like 'dominated' and 'mass-produced' being replaced with clear B1-level equivalents ('was the most common type' and 'produced many bananas'). This is a model submission.",
