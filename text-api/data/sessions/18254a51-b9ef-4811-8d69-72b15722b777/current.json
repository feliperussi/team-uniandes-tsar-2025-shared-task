    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6448 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The text also fails CEFR compliance and contains vocabulary above the A2 level.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6448 is too low.\n    *   The original text's mention of 'all structures' is lost, narrowing the scope to only bridges.\n    *   The positive sentiment conveyed by 'Luckily' is entirely absent.\n    *   The crucial detail that engineers 'have learned to design bridges... on areas that are much more resistant to movement' is simplified to 'These bridges can resist movement. So, they do not move much,' losing the emphasis on the *learning process*, the *specific method* (designing on resistant areas), and the *degree* of resistance ('much more').\n*   CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR_Classifier_Result is 'B1', not 'A2'. This indicates the text is still too complex for the target level.\n*   Vocabulary Violation: The word 'damage' is classified as B1. An A2 text must use simpler vocabulary.\n*   Vocabulary Violation: The word 'resist' is classified as B2. An A2 text must use simpler vocabulary.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Restore the concept of 'all structures' being affected by earthquakes, not just bridges.\n*   Reintroduce the positive sentiment of 'luckily' or a similar A2 phrase.\n*   Explicitly state that engineers have found *better ways* to build bridges.\n*   Clarify that these new ways involve building bridges *in places* or *on ground* that does not move much during an earthquake.\n*   Replace 'damage' with an A2 equivalent like 'hurt' or 'break'.\n*   Replace 'resist' with an A2 equivalent like 'stop' or 'not move with'.",
