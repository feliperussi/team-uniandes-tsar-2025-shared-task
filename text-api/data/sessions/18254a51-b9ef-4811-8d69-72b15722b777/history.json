The core message regarding the specific context of 'earthquake zones' for bridge design was not fully preserved. The original text states 'Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement.' Your version simplifies this to 'They choose special places for new bridges. These places can stand against the ground movement very well,' which loses the explicit and crucial mention of 'earthquake zones' as the specific location where these design principles are applied. This omission reduces the semantic fidelity to the original text. The BERTScore of 0.9053 is acceptable, but it cannot compensate for the loss of core meaning. The CEFR classifier result of B1 is also incorrect, indicating the text is too complex for A2, despite the simplification attempts. This is likely due to the sentence structure and vocabulary choices that, while simplified, still retain a B1 complexity level in the classifier's assessment. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence to explicitly include the context of 'earthquake zones' to ensure the full meaning is preserved. For example, 'Engineers learned to build bridges better in places where earthquakes happen. They choose special places that can stand against the ground movement very well.' Additionally, review the overall sentence structure and vocabulary to ensure it strictly adheres to A2 complexity, avoiding any B1 structures or words.",
