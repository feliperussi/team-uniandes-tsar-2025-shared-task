    "feedback": "The output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found when comparing the output against the original text. The meaning and fidelity of the text are excellent, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 (well above the 0.75 threshold) and the BERTScore of 0.985 (well above the 0.90 threshold). The core message and key lexical items are fully preserved. Furthermore, the text accurately achieves the target B1 CEFR level, as confirmed by the CEFR classifier result. Qualitatively, the simplification makes subtle but effective changes. For instance, contractions like 'you'll' and 'you've' are expanded to 'you will' and 'you have', which can aid clarity for some B1 learners. The change from 'Now' to 'Then' provides a slightly clearer sequential flow to the instructions. The vocabulary remains appropriate for B1, and no complex terms were introduced or mishandled. The overall structure and flow are natural and easy to follow. This is a highly accurate and well-executed B1 simplification, demonstrating a strong understanding of the target level and content preservation.",
