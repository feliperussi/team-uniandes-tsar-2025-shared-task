        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. The simplification has made the text too simple for the target audience. While the factual integrity and meaning preservation are excellent (MeaningBERT: 0.9453, BERTScore: 0.9466), the linguistic choices consistently lean towards a lower CEFR level. For instance, the original text's 'events' was simplified to 'things that happen', which is a very basic A2-level phrasing. The sentence structures are also consistently simple, relying on basic conjunctions like 'if', 'so', 'because', and 'and then' without introducing more complex B1-level sentence structures or vocabulary. To achieve a B1 classification, consider reintroducing some slightly more complex vocabulary (e.g., 'events' instead of 'things that happen') and varying sentence structures to include more B1-appropriate conjunctions or clauses, while still maintaining clarity and avoiding overly complex phrasing.",

        "feedback_text": "The output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found when comparing the output against the original text. The meaning and fidelity of the text are excellent, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 (well above the 0.75 threshold) and the BERTScore of 0.985 (well above the 0.90 threshold). The core message and key lexical items are fully preserved. Furthermore, the text accurately achieves the target B1 CEFR level, as confirmed by the CEFR classifier result. Qualitatively, the simplification makes subtle but effective changes. For instance, contractions like 'you'll' and 'you've' are expanded to 'you will' and 'you have', which can aid clarity for some B1 learners. The change from 'Now' to 'Then' provides a slightly clearer sequential flow to the instructions. The vocabulary remains appropriate for B1, and no complex terms were introduced or mishandled. The overall structure and flow are natural and easy to follow. This is a highly accurate and well-executed B1 simplification, demonstrating a strong understanding of the target level and content preservation.",
