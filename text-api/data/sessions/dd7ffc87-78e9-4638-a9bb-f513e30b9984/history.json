        "feedback_text": "The text fails on two counts. First, the word 'Engineers' is B1 level, a clear violation of the A2 vocabulary rule. A simpler phrase like 'people who build bridges' is required. Second, the sentence 'the bridge was made to hold a certain amount of weight' uses the passive voice. A2 texts must use simple, active sentence structures. These errors make the text unacceptable."

        "feedback_text": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It maintains perfect factual accuracy. Complex concepts like 'engineers' and 'inferior-quality material' are expertly rephrased using A2 vocabulary ('People who build bridges', 'bad material'). Sentence structure is simple, direct, and avoids complex grammar like the passive voice. No violations of the A2 standard were found."
