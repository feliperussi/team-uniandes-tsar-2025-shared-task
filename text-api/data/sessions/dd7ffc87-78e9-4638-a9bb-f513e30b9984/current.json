    "text_translated": "Sometimes bridges fall down and we do not know why. People who build bridges have to do a complete study to understand the reason. Sometimes, this happens because people built the bridge with bad material. Or it happens because an important part of the bridge had a problem. In other cases, the bridge could only hold a certain amount of weight. It could not hold more weight than that.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It maintains perfect factual accuracy. Complex concepts like 'engineers' and 'inferior-quality material' are expertly rephrased using A2 vocabulary ('People who build bridges', 'bad material'). Sentence structure is simple, direct, and avoids complex grammar like the passive voice. No violations of the A2 standard were found.",
