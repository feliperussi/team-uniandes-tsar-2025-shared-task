    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards. It accurately preserves all factual information and the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8055 and a BERTScore of 0.932. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been consistently simplified to A1/A2 level, replacing more complex terms like 'art world' with 'people in art' and 'galleries' with 'art places'. Sentence structures are short and simple, using basic connectors appropriate for the A2 level. The simplification of 'appreciated' to 'like them' and 'celebrated' to 'praise them' is effective for the target level. The repetition of 'art people' is acceptable for A2 simplicity, prioritizing clarity over stylistic variation.",
