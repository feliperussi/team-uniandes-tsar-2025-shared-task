The core message and specific details from the original text were not adequately preserved. The output loses crucial specificity and nuance. The original text asks about 'graffiti and street art' and the 'art world's' opinion, and discusses 'growing recognition of its value as an art form'. Your version generalizes this to 'this art' and 'art people' thinking 'this art is good' and 'real art'. This simplification diminishes the original's precise meaning. The term 'graffiti' is entirely omitted from the opening question, which is a significant loss of information. Suggestion: Restore the specific terms 'graffiti' and 'street art' in the opening question. Rephrase to convey the concept of the 'art world' and the 'growing recognition of its value as an art form' more accurately, while maintaining A2 simplicity. For example, 'What do people in art think about graffiti and street art? Now, more and more people think this art is important and good.'",

Specific deviations are listed below. 1. The original phrase 'growing recognition of its value as an art form' was simplified to 'more and more people think this art is important and good'. This loses the specific concept of 'value as an art form' and the formal 'recognition' within the art world, reducing it to a general positive opinion. 2. The original phrase 'She defended street artists' was simplified to 'She said good things about street art people'. This weakens the meaning, as 'defended' implies a stronger stance against criticism or negative perceptions, which is lost in the simpler phrasing. Suggestion: Rephrase 'more and more people think this art is important and good' to better convey 'growing recognition of its value as an art form'. Suggestion: Rephrase 'She said good things about street art people' to reflect the stronger meaning of 'defended street artists'.",

It accurately preserves all factual information and the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8055 and a BERTScore of 0.932. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been consistently simplified to A1/A2 level, replacing more complex terms like 'art world' with 'people in art' and 'galleries' with 'art places'. Sentence structures are short and simple, using basic connectors appropriate for the A2 level. The simplification of 'appreciated' to 'like them' and 'celebrated' to 'praise them' is effective for the target level. The repetition of 'art people' is acceptable for A2 simplicity, prioritizing clarity over stylistic variation.",
