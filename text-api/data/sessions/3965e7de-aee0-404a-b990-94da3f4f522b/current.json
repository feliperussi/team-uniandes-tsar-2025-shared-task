    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, dates, and the core message from the original text are accurately preserved.\n- Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.80 and BERTScore of 0.92 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text demonstrates exemplary A2 characteristics.\n- Qualitative Analysis: The vocabulary is strictly A2, with the single B1 word 'cave' correctly handled by providing an immediate, simple definition. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic A2 connectors ('but', 'so', 'and', 'or'). The complex question from the original was successfully broken down into a series of simple questions. No deviations detected.",
