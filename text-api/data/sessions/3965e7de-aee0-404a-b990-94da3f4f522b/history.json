The core message of the original text has been degraded.\n\n- The phrase 'evidence of early human civilisation' was simplified to 'people started to do new things'. This is an unacceptable loss of meaning. The original refers to the start of organized society, not just new activities.\n- The original states humans became 'more complex and more intelligent'. Your version only says they became 'smarter', completely omitting the crucial concept of 'complex'.\n- The original questions the 'connection between' new behaviors and language. Your version changes this to 'because of language', which incorrectly implies a direct causal link that the original text does not claim.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost concepts. Rephrase to include the idea of people living together in groups. Re-introduce the idea that people became more complex, not just smarter. Use a phrase like 'the link between' to accurately reflect the original's uncertainty.",
