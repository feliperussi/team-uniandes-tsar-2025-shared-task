    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6657 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The simplification of key concepts has weakened the text's meaning. The original text conveys a specific sense of tragedy and sudden, disorienting events.\n- The phrase 'Tragically... all drown' was replaced with 'Sadly... die in the water'. This replacement is too general. It loses the specific, violent, and impactful meaning of 'drown', which is central to the tragic event.\n- The original 'finds himself in a lifeboat' implies a sudden and surprising situation. Your version, 'Pi survives in a small boat', is a simple summary of the outcome and loses this important nuance of disorientation.\n- While 'emigrate' is a B1 word, its replacement 'move' does not fully capture the meaning of leaving one's country permanently to settle in another.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the core meaning. The concept of 'drowning' must be communicated more directly to preserve the tragic tone. The description of Pi's survival must better reflect the suddenness of the event.",
