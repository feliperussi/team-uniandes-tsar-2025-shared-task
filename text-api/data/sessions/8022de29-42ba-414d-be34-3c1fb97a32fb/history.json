Your version separates these into disconnected statements, which weakens this critical cause-and-effect relationship.\n- Tonal Inaccuracy: The original uses 'Tragically' to describe the family's death. Your version ('Pi's family dies in the water.') is too neutral and loses the emotional weight of the event. The phrase 'But Pi is okay' further minimizes the tragedy.\n- Factual Error: The original specifies animals were sold to zoos in 'North America'. Your text incorrectly states 'America'. This is a geographical inaccuracy.\n- Over-simplification: While sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2, the content has been simplified to the point of losing essential meaning and nuance.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the direct link between the government and the decision to move.

Your output breaks this into a simple list of facts ('Sadly, Pi's family dies in the water. The people on the ship also die. Pi does not die.'). This deconstruction into overly simplistic, disconnected sentences destroys the core narrative meaning of tragedy and survival, resulting in the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Structural Defect: While A2 requires simple sentences, your text is excessively fragmented. This fragmentation is the direct cause of the meaning preservation failure.\n\n- Suggestion: Reintroduce simple A2 connectors to restore meaning. Combine the sentences about the deaths to show contrast. Correction: 'Sadly, Pi's family and the people on the ship die in the water, but Pi does not die.' This single sentence uses the A2 connector 'but' to restore the critical contrast present in the original text.",

Breaking complex ideas into too many short, separate sentences has destroyed the cause-and-effect relationships present in the original source.\n- Evidence: The original text links the parents' worry directly to a single, combined decision: \"Worried about the future, Pi's parents decide to close the zoo and emigrate to Canada.\"\n- Your output separates this into two weaker statements: \"They are worried about the future, so they decide to close their zoo. They want to move to Canada.\" This separation breaks the strong causal link and changes the meaning from a single, drastic plan into two sequential thoughts.\n- The original's phrase \"finds himself in a lifeboat\" conveys a sense of suddenness and surprise. Your version, \"He is in a small boat,\" is a simple description that loses this important narrative element.\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by combining sentences. Use A2 connectors like 'because' to explicitly link cause and effect. The text must be simplified without sacrificing the fundamental logic of the source material.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and the relationships between ideas from the original text.\n\n- The primary cause of this failure is excessive simplification. The original text uses clauses to connect ideas within single sentences, creating a cohesive narrative. Your output breaks these into separate, disconnected statements, which weakens the overall meaning.\n- Example of meaning loss: The original states, \"the family travel by ship to Canada taking the animals with them.\" This is a single, integrated action. Your version, \"The family travels to Canada on a big ship. They take the other animals with them,\" presents two separate facts, losing the direct link that they were traveling *with* the animals as part of the same journey.\n- The simplification of \"drown\" to \"die in the water\" also contributes to the meaning loss. While factually similar, \"drown\" is a specific, direct action that carries more weight than the more general phrase \"die in the water.\"\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by combining some of the overly fragmented sentences. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' to link closely related ideas. The goal is simplicity, not disconnection. Rephrase: 'The family travels to Canada on a big ship and takes the other animals with them.' This maintains A2 simplicity while preserving the original's connected meaning.",
