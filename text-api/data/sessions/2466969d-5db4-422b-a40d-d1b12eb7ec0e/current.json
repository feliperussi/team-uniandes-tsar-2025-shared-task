For example, in 2013, a small asteroid exploded above a city in Russia. It was 19 metres big. It hurt 1,200 people. The asteroids that are 140 metres or more are much more dangerous.

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets the A2 CEFR readability standard while preserving factual integrity and core meaning.\n\nThe text passed all priority checks:\n- Factual Integrity Check: No discrepancies were found between the original text and the writer's output.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Check: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7812 is above the 0.75 threshold, indicating good preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9163 is above the 0.90 threshold, showing strong lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Check: The CEFR classifier correctly rated the text as 'A2'.\n\nDeep Qualitative Audit:\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary used is appropriate for A2. Complex terms from the original like 'logging', 'estimated', 'unaccounted for', and 'enter Earth's orbit' were simplified to A1/A2 equivalents such as 'track', 'think', 'not known', and 'come near Earth'. The keyword 'asteroids' was effectively defined in simple A1 terms ('rocks in space'). No unapproved B1/B2 words were detected.\n- Structural Analysis: The text uses short, simple sentences. Connectors are limited to A1/A2 level ('so', 'because', 'for example', 'if'). The use of 'that' in 'The asteroids that are 140 metres or more' is a simple restrictive relative clause, which is acceptable at A2 for identification.\n\nThe simplification is effective and maintains the essential information in an accessible format for an A2 learner.",
