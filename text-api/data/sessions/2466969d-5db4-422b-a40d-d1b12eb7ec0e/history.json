The phrase 'would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit' was also softened to 'can be very dangerous. This is if they come near Earth', losing some of the original's directness and specificity regarding the threat.

Your version separates these ideas, stating 'These middle-sized asteroids can be a serious danger' and then later 'The bigger, middle-sized asteroids are not known. They can be a serious danger if they come near Earth,' which dilutes the impact and the logical flow of the original's argument for the urgency of logging.

      "content": "Text saved: Asteroids are rocks in space. NASA wants to track some smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres big or more. We think there are 25,000 of these asteroids. NASA has tracked about 8,000 of them. So, 17,000 are still not known. NASA wants to track them because they can be a serious danger. For example, in 2013, a small asteroid exploded above a city in Russia. It was 19 metres big. It hurt 1,200 people. The asteroids that are 140 metres or more are much more dangerous. They can be a serious danger if they come near Earth.",

        "feedback_text": "PASS: The text successfully meets the A2 CEFR readability standard while preserving factual integrity and core meaning.\n\nThe text passed all priority checks:\n- Factual Integrity Check: No discrepancies were found between the original text and the writer's output.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Check: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7812 is above the 0.75 threshold, indicating good preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9163 is above the 0.90 threshold, showing strong lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Check: The CEFR classifier correctly rated the text as 'A2'.\n\nDeep Qualitative Audit:\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary used is appropriate for A2. Complex terms from the original like 'logging', 'estimated', 'unaccounted for', and 'enter Earth's orbit' were simplified to A1/A2 equivalents such as 'track', 'think', 'not known', and 'come near Earth'. The keyword 'asteroids' was effectively defined in simple A1 terms ('rocks in space'). No unapproved B1/B2 words were detected.\n- Structural Analysis: The text uses short, simple sentences. Connectors are limited to A1/A2 level ('so', 'because', 'for example', 'if'). The use of 'that' in 'The asteroids that are 140 metres or more' is a simple restrictive relative clause, which is acceptable at A2 for identification.\n\nThe simplification is effective and maintains the essential information in an accessible format for an A2 learner.",
