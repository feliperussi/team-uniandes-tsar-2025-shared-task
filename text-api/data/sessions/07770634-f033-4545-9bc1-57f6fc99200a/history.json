The CEFR classifier rated the output as 'B2', which is too advanced for the required 'B1' level. The primary reason for this is the overly complex structure of the first sentence: 'Another suggested defence against an asteroid, which is a large rock that travels through space, is to blow it up with a nuclear weapon if it is on a course to hit Earth'. This single sentence combines a non-defining relative clause and a conditional clause, making it difficult for a B1 reader to process. Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two or three simpler ones to meet the B1 standard. For example: 'An asteroid is a large rock that travels through space. If an asteroid is on a course to hit Earth, one suggested defence is to blow it up with a nuclear weapon.'",

While the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, it failed its primary goal of simplification to the correct CEFR level. The B2 classification is likely due to complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'According to this plan, eight-ton rockets would be fired at an approaching asteroid with the hope of pushing it off course' uses passive voice ('would be fired') and a complex prepositional phrase. The final sentence also contains a complex conditional structure ('if the asteroid was too close to Earth for this plan to work...'). To meet the B1 target, these sentences should be split or rephrased. Suggestion: 'The plan is to fire eight-ton rockets at an asteroid. The hope is that this will push it off course.'",

The handling of the keyword 'asteroid' is a model of best practice; defining it in the first sentence immediately clarifies the topic for the reader. Furthermore, the strategy of breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, well-connected ones (e.g., explaining the HAMMER plan across three clear sentences) is highly effective for the B1 level. The vocabulary choices are perfect, simplifying complex phrases while retaining essential B1 terms. No improvements are necessary.",
