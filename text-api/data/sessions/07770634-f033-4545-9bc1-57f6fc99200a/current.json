    "text_translated": "An asteroid is a large rock that travels through space. An asteroid might be on a course to hit Earth. In that case, one suggested defence is to blow it up with a nuclear weapon. This idea may sound like the plot from a film. It was the subject of the 1998 movie *Armageddon*. However, NASA has a real plan for this called HAMMER. The plan is to fire eight-ton rockets at an approaching asteroid. The hope is that this will push it off course. However, this plan might not work if the asteroid was too close to Earth. In that case, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The output is factually identical to the original. The MeaningBERT (0.90) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of the keyword 'asteroid' is a model of best practice; defining it in the first sentence immediately clarifies the topic for the reader. Furthermore, the strategy of breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, well-connected ones (e.g., explaining the HAMMER plan across three clear sentences) is highly effective for the B1 level. The vocabulary choices are perfect, simplifying complex phrases while retaining essential B1 terms. No improvements are necessary.",
