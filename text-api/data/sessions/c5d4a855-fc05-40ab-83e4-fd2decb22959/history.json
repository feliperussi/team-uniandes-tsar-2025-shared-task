While the simplification successfully maintains factual integrity (Priority 1) and preserves meaning and fidelity (MeaningBERT 0.85, BERTScore 0.917), the linguistic complexity has been reduced below the target B1 level. For example, the original text's 'are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' was simplified to 'probably happen just by chance, and they do not mean you can see the future'. This phrasing, along with the direct 'if you dream' conditional structure and the use of 'we often forget' instead of 'we probably choose to forget', contributes to an overall A2 classification. To achieve B1, the text needs to incorporate slightly more complex sentence structures, a wider range of B1-level connectors, or reintroduce some B1 vocabulary that was simplified, ensuring it remains accessible without becoming B2.",

The simplification did not sufficiently reduce the complexity of the original text. Specifically, the vocabulary term 'coincidence' (B2) was retained, and 'prophecy' (C1) was also kept, both of which are above the B1 level. The first sentence, 'For example, dreams of a phone call from an old friend or of someone close to you dying are more likely to be a coincidence than a prophecy,' is also quite long and contains multiple clauses, making it challenging for a B1 reader. To achieve B1, consider replacing 'coincidence' with a simpler phrase like 'just by chance' or 'not planned', and 'prophecy' with 'a real prediction'. Also, break down longer sentences into shorter, more direct ones.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. The primary reason for this classification is the oversimplification of sentence structure. The original text's first sentence, 'Dreams of a phone call from an old friend or the death of someone close, for example, are more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy,' was broken down into three very short, simple sentences in the output: 'For example, sometimes we dream about a phone call from an old friend. Or we dream that someone close to us dies. These dreams are probably just by chance, not a real prediction.' While the vocabulary simplification from 'coincidence' to 'by chance' and 'prophecy' to 'prediction' is appropriate for B1, the sentence structure is too basic. To achieve a B1 level, the writer should aim for a balance of simple and compound sentences, and occasionally a more complex sentence structure, rather than exclusively using very short, simple sentences. For instance, the first two sentences could be combined using a B1-level connector or a more sophisticated conjunction, or the original structure could be maintained with simpler vocabulary.",
