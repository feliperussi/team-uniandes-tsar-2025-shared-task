    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5628 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message and semantic nuances of the original text. While the individual facts are present, the overall meaning and emphasis have been diluted through over-simplification and restructuring. Specific deviations include: The original's more precise phrasing, such as 'serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey', is simplified to 'use this venom to stun or kill their food', losing the formal and direct statement of purpose. The output adds explanatory sentences like 'Venom is a special liquid' and 'Anti-venom is a special medicine for venom' which are not present in the original text and alter the semantic content. The original's concise statement 'Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-venom was developed in 1981' is broken into multiple sentences, adding 'People think it is very dangerous' and separating the cause-effect relationship, which dilutes the original's directness. The idiom 'rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way' is simplified to 'Do not bother them', losing the specific nuance of the original phrase. The descriptive terms 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs' and 'embed themselves' are replaced with less precise phrases like 'throw out a cloud of hairs' and 'stick in your skin or eyes', reducing the fidelity of the original's description. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to maintain the semantic density and specific relationships of the original, even when simplifying vocabulary and grammar. Avoid adding information not explicitly stated in the source text. Focus on simplifying the expression of the original meaning, not altering the meaning itself.",
