This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and structure of the original text. The writer's output begins with two paragraphs explicitly defining 'venom' and 'anti-venom'. While these are relevant keywords, the original text does not start with such definitions; its core message is a narrative about spider venom, its purpose, and specific examples. Adding this introductory content fundamentally alters the original text's message and flow. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8775 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. This is due to numerous lexical changes throughout the text, such as replacing 'stunning or killing their prey' with 'catch their food. It makes their food stop or die', and 'since anti-venom was developed' with 'because we have anti-venom now'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the cumulative effect of these changes, combined with the added content, results in a low fidelity to the original. Suggestion: Do not add new narrative content, such as explicit definitions, that is not present in the original text's narrative flow. Focus solely on simplifying the provided original text. Maintain closer lexical fidelity to the original text where A2 vocabulary allows, to improve BERTScore.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5898 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuanced relationships between ideas. The text also failed CEFR compliance by being classified as B1. Deviations: Meaning Preservation: The original text's emphasis on the primary purpose of venom for prey 'rather than attacking humans' is diluted by separating these concepts into disconnected sentences. For example, 'It is not for humans' is presented as a standalone fact, losing the contrast. Meaning Preservation: The use of discourse markers like 'In fact' and 'although' in the original text conveyed important emphasis and conditional relationships. Their removal flattens the meaning and reduces the impact of statements about rarity and pain. CEFR Compliance: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is due to the inclusion of vocabulary above the A2 level. Vocabulary: The word 'species' is a B1 word. Vocabulary: The word 'painful' is a B1 word. Vocabulary: The word 'rarely' is a B1 word. Vocabulary: The word 'irritating' is a B1 word. Vocabulary: The word 'stick' (meaning attach) is a B1 word. Corrective Path: Rephrase sentences to explicitly link the purpose of venom to prey and contrast it with humans, using simple A2 connectors. Reintroduce the sense of rarity and conditionality using A2-appropriate phrasing. Replace all B1 vocabulary with simpler A2 equivalents. For example, 'species' could be 'types of spiders', 'painful' could be 'it hurts a lot', 'rarely' could be 'not often', 'irritating' could be 'makes you itch', 'stick' could be 'go into'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8992 is also below the required 0.90, showing a loss of key lexical detail.\n\nDeviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes that venom is for prey 'rather than attacking humans' and that only '25 of the known spider species produce venom which can actually harm humans'. Your version simplifies this to 'They do not use it to attack people' and 'Only 25 types of spiders have venom that can harm people', losing the crucial contrast and the specific context of 'known species' and 'actually harm'. The specific defense mechanism of 'urticating hairs' is reduced to 'hairs that make you itch', losing precision and the specific nature of the defense. The original's emphasis on 'rarely deadly' is also softened.\n- BERTScore Failure: Key phrases and words from the original were lost or overly simplified. Examples include 'serves the purpose of', 'rather than', 'in fact', 'known spider species', 'produce venom which can actually harm', 'although', 'painful', 'deadly', 'notorious', 'produced any fatalities', 'developed', 'take care not to rub...up the wrong way', 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs', 'irritating hairs', 'embed themselves', and 'attacker'. The addition of 'lives in Australia' is also a deviation from the original content, introducing new information.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the core message of each sentence in the original text. Ensure that the simplified version retains the precise relationships and distinctions (e.g., 'rather than', 'only X of Y'). Use more direct translations of key terms where possible, even if simplified, to maintain lexical fidelity. For example, 'urticating hairs' could be 'special hairs that make you itch' to retain more detail. Ensure no new information is added that was not present in the original text.",

While the BERTScore of 0.9085 indicates good lexical fidelity, the overall meaning and nuance of the original text have been lost or significantly altered. Specific deviations include: 1. The word 'notorious' (implying a well-known negative reputation or danger) was replaced with 'famous' (a neutral or positive term). This fundamentally changes the perception of the Sydney funnel-web spider from a dangerous creature to merely a well-known one, losing the original's emphasis on its dangerous nature and the importance of anti-venom. 2. The phrase 'rather than attacking humans' which clearly states the primary purpose of venom is for prey, not humans, was simplified to 'not to attack people'. This loses the comparative nuance of the original statement regarding the venom's intended use. 3. The overall tone regarding the inherent danger of certain spiders is softened in the simplified text, deviating from the original's more informative and cautionary stance. Suggestion: Rephrase the description of the Sydney funnel-web spider to retain its dangerous connotation using A2 vocabulary. For example, 'The Sydney funnel-web spider is a very dangerous spider from Australia.' Rephrase the purpose of venom to clearly state its primary use for prey, not for people, for example, 'They use it to stun or kill their food. They do not use it to attack people.'",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message, nuances, and specific details, despite retaining general facts. The simplification process has stripped away critical aspects of meaning.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Loss (Purpose of Venom): The original states, 'Spider venom is present in most species and serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans.' Your version, 'Spiders use this venom to stun or kill their food, not to attack people,' separates these ideas, weakening the direct contrast and the emphasis on the primary purpose. The added sentence 'Venom is a special liquid' is an unnecessary detail that does not contribute to the core message about the venom's purpose.\n2.  Meaning Loss (Reputation): The original uses 'Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider.' Your version, 'The Sydney funnel-web spider is a very dangerous spider from Australia,' loses the specific nuance of 'notorious,' which conveys a widely known and feared reputation beyond just being 'very dangerous.'\n3.  Meaning Loss (Idiomatic Expression): The original phrase 'take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way' is an idiom. While 'Do not make them angry' is an A2 simplification, it completely loses the idiomatic nuance and specific cultural context of the original expression.\n4.  Meaning Loss (Specificity of Defense Mechanism): The original describes 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs. These irritating hairs then embed themselves in the skin or eyes of the attacker.' Your version, 'They throw out special hairs. These hairs make you itch. They can get into your skin or eyes,' is too vague. 'Special hairs' lacks the specificity of 'urticating' or 'irritating,' which describe the exact nature of the harm.

While the factual information is largely present, the core message and the nuanced emphasis of the original text have been lost. The original text aims to dispel common fears about spiders by highlighting that venom is primarily for prey, few species harm humans, and even notorious spiders are no longer deadly due to anti-venom. Your simplified version presents these facts but loses the overarching reassuring tone and the direct counter-argument to common misconceptions. For example, the original's 'rather than attacking humans' clearly contrasts the purpose of venom, which is weakened by your 'They do not attack people with it.' Similarly, the original's 'In fact, only 25...' emphasizes a correction of a common belief, which is lost in 'Only 25 types of spiders have venom'. The direct link between the Sydney funnel-web spider's notoriety and the reassurance of no fatalities due to anti-venom is also diluted by splitting the information and adding subjective statements like 'Many people know this spider. They think it is very dangerous.' This separation weakens the original's clear message of reassurance against a known threat. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the original's emphasis on dispelling fear and providing reassurance. Ensure the connection between common fears and factual counter-arguments is clearer. Strengthen the contrast between spider use of venom for prey and their interaction with humans.",
