    "text_translated": "Sometimes, it is not clear why a bridge falls down. Experts only understand the reason after they do a complete study. This can happen because the building material was low quality. It can also happen if an important part of the bridge had a problem. In other cases, a bridge was built to hold only a certain amount of weight. It was not made to hold more than that.",

The simplification of terms like 'engineers' to 'experts' and 'investigation' to 'study' is appropriate for the level. All rules were followed.",
