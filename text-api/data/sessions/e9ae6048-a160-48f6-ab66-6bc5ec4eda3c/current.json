    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). This means they fly very close to Earth. They pass less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But we are safe. None of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to watch these rocks. So, NASA can say if a rock is going to hit Earth. If an asteroid is a danger, we have a plan. We can use two ways to keep us safe.",

    "feedback": "The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. It correctly uses short, declarative sentences. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. The technical term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is correctly introduced and then immediately explained in simple terms ('they fly very close to Earth'). Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No violations detected.",
