The sentence structure and factual accuracy are correct, but the use of a single B1 word results in an immediate failure. An A2 alternative like 'keep us safe' was required."

The technical term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is correctly introduced and then immediately explained in simple terms ('they fly very close to Earth'). Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No violations detected."
