    "grade": 2,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8944 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text due to over-simplification and extensive rephrasing. For example, the original phrase 'caught on to the profitability' was replaced with 'want to make money. This is called profitability', and 'underutilised resources' was broken into 'resources. People do not use these resources enough', losing the original lexical density and direct phrasing. FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is a critical deviation from the A2 standard. The text contains numerous words and phrases above the A2 level, even when definitions are provided. The presence of these words makes the text unsuitable for an A2 learner. Specific deviations include: The word 'profitability' is B1. The word 'economy' is B1. The word 'middleman' is B1. The idiom 'cash in on' is B1/B2. The phrasal verb 'let out' (in the context of renting) is B1. The word 'lucrative' is B1. The word 'accommodation' is B1. The word 'encourages' is B1. The word 'means' (used as 'this means') is B2. Suggestion: Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 equivalents. For example, instead of 'profitability', use 'making money'. Instead of 'economy', use 'how people make and use money'. Instead of 'middleman', use 'a person or company that connects two groups'. Rephrase sentences to avoid idioms and complex phrasal verbs. Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2.",
