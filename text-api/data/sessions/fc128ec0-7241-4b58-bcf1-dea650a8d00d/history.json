The simplified text loses some of the core meaning and specific emphasis present in the original. This is a critical failure in conveying the full message at an A2 level.\n\n- The original text's emphasis on 'profitability' and 'seeking to gain from making use of those underutilised resources' is diluted. Your version states 'sharing economy can make money' and 'They use things people do not use much', which is less precise and less active than the original's description of businesses actively pursuing gain from specific resources.\n- The specific role of companies like Airbnb as a 'middleman' is lost. Your text only says 'It connects people', which describes the function but omits the crucial intermediary nature of the platform, a key aspect of the sharing economy model.\n- The strong emphasis on high earnings, conveyed by 'cash in on' and 'lucrative accommodation', is weakened to simply 'make money' and 'get more money'. This reduces the impact of the financial incentive described in the original.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.9007 is acceptable, indicating lexical fidelity, the MeaningBERT score highlights that the overall message's nuance and emphasis have been compromised.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the active pursuit of profit and the specific intermediary role of the platforms. Ensure the financial benefits are conveyed with a similar degree of emphasis as in the original, using appropriate A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of just 'make money', consider phrases like 'make good money' or 'earn a lot of money' if the context allows for A2 simplification of 'lucrative'.",

The task is to simplify the provided text, not to add new information or definitions.

The simplification loses some of the nuance of 'profitability' and 'lucrative accommodation' from the original.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.89 is below the required 0.90. Key terms like 'profitability', 'underutilised resources', 'rapidly risen in popularity', 'cash in on', and 'lucrative accommodation' were replaced with less precise or different phrasing, leading to a loss of lexical detail.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the added definition of 'economy'. Focus strictly on simplifying the existing information without introducing new concepts. Rephrase to better capture the specific meaning of 'profitability' and 'lucrative' using A2 vocabulary, ensuring closer lexical alignment with the original text.",

This indicates a slight but critical loss of lexical detail and factual phrasing from the original text. While the overall meaning is preserved, the simplification process removed too many key terms that contribute to the fidelity score. The A2 standard requires precise simplification, not the complete removal of important lexical items. \n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The phrase 'profitability of the sharing economy' was simplified to 'make a lot of money. They use things that people do not use enough. This is called the sharing economy.' The direct term 'profitability' was lost.\n- 'underutilised resources' was simplified to 'things that people do not use enough.' The term 'resources' was lost.\n- 'rapidly risen in popularity' was simplified to 'became popular quickly.' The verb 'risen' was lost.\n- 'puts customers in contact with' was simplified to 'connects customers and people.' The specific phrasing 'in contact with' was lost.\n- 'cash in on their unused rooms and houses and let them out as lucrative accommodation' was simplified to 'earn a lot of money from their unused rooms and houses. They rent these places to other people.' Key phrases like 'cash in on', 'let them out', and 'lucrative accommodation' were replaced with more general descriptions.\n- 'personal cars' was simplified to 'cars.' The adjective 'personal' was lost.\n\nSuggestion: While simplification is necessary for A2, it must not come at the cost of lexical fidelity as measured by BERTScore. Re-evaluate simplifications to retain more key nouns and verbs where possible, even if they are explained in simpler terms. For example, instead of completely removing 'resources', consider 'things that are resources and people do not use enough'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text due to over-simplification and extensive rephrasing.

This is a critical deviation from the A2 standard. The text contains numerous words and phrases above the A2 level, even when definitions are provided. The presence of these words makes the text unsuitable for an A2 learner. Specific deviations include: The word 'profitability' is B1. The word 'economy' is B1. The word 'middleman' is B1. The idiom 'cash in on' is B1/B2. The phrasal verb 'let out' (in the context of renting) is B1. The word 'lucrative' is B1. The word 'accommodation' is B1. The word 'encourages' is B1. The word 'means' (used as 'this means') is B2. Suggestion: Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 equivalents. For example, instead of 'profitability', use 'making money'. Instead of 'economy', use 'how people make and use money'. Instead of 'middleman', use 'a person or company that connects two groups'. Rephrase sentences to avoid idioms and complex phrasal verbs. Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2.",
