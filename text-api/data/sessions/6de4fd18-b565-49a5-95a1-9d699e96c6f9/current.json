She knows they're not typical pets, and she has repeatedly tried to explain patiently to people that rats aren't dirty and they make fantastic pets if you look after them correctly. But she understands why people react badly. She didn't like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats, and she saw how affectionate and intelligent they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.986) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The simplification from 'lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain' to 'she has repeatedly tried to explain patiently' is a good example of simplifying a slightly more idiomatic phrase to a more direct and accessible expression for a B1 learner, while retaining the full meaning. The text is clear, coherent, and well-structured, making it highly suitable for a B1 audience.",
