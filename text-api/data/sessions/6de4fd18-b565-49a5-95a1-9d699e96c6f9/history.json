She knows that her rats are not common pets, and she has often tried to explain to people that rats are not dirty, because they can be great pets if you look after them correctly. However, she understands why people have a bad reaction. She also didn't like rats until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats, and then she saw how loving and clever they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe chose to have two of them.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple, instead of the required 'B1'. While the meaning and fidelity were well-preserved (MeaningBERT 0.7856, BERTScore 0.9643), the simplification strategy resulted in a text that falls below the target B1 level. The vocabulary choices, such as changing 'typical pets' to 'common pets', 'fantastic pets' to 'great pets', and 'affectionate and intelligent' to 'loving and clever', along with the simplification of the phrase 'lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain' to 'often tried to explain', have collectively lowered the linguistic complexity. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to incorporate more B1-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. For instance, 'typical pets' and 'fantastic pets' could have been retained, or 'affectionate and intelligent' could have been used. The phrase 'lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain' could be simplified to something like 'repeatedly tried to explain patiently' to maintain a B1 nuance.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.986) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The simplification from 'lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain' to 'she has repeatedly tried to explain patiently' is a good example of simplifying a slightly more idiomatic phrase to a more direct and accessible expression for a B1 learner, while retaining the full meaning. The text is clear, coherent, and well-structured, making it highly suitable for a B1 audience.",
