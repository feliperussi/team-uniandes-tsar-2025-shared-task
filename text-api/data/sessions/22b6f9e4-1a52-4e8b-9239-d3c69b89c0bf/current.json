    "text_translated": "Pi (the boy) and Richard Parker (the tiger) spend 227\u202fdays together in the small lifeboat. They go through hunger, illness and extreme tiredness. They face violent storms and the burning heat of the Pacific sun, but they somehow survive. Sometimes Pi finds comfort in his three religions, yet at other moments he feels lonely and sad. Finally, the Mexican coast appears on the horizon (the line where the sea meets the sky), and everything changes. It would be a shame to reveal the ending, so you will have to read the book yourself to discover what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when land comes into view.",

    "feedback": "The submission is a PASS with a high grade. It successfully passed all priority checks: factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.78), fidelity (BERTScore 0.96), and CEFR B1 compliance. The simplification strategy is excellent. The in-text definitions for the keywords 'Pi' and 'Richard Parker' and the C1-level word 'horizon' are highly effective for the target audience. Vocabulary substitutions, such as replacing 'endure' with 'face' and 'exhaustion' with 'extreme tiredness', are well-chosen and maintain the core meaning while reducing complexity. The overall structure is clear and fluent. For future improvement, consider that simplifying a strong C1 word like 'despair' to the A1 word 'sad' loses some emotional intensity. A B1 alternative like 'felt hopeless' could have been a closer match, but the current choice is acceptable for its clarity.",
