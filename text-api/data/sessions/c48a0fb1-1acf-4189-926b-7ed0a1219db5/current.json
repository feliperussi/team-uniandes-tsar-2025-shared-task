    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about genes. We want to know how they work with our brain and language. Did some genes change so we can speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. DNA is the information inside every part of our body. Maybe one day we are going to find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. It correctly identifies and defines complex keywords ('gene', 'DNA') using simple A1/A2 vocabulary. Sentence structure is consistently simple and declarative. Vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'mutation' to 'change', 'researchers' to 'scientists') is executed perfectly without losing factual accuracy. The text fully adheres to all rules.",
