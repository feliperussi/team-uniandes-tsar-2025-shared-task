Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

This is an immediate failure. The goal is to use vocabulary the student already possesses, not to introduce new, unexplained terms above the A2 level. Additionally, the term 'DNA' is not A2 vocabulary and is left unexplained."

Sentence structure is consistently simple and declarative. Vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'mutation' to 'change', 'researchers' to 'scientists') is executed perfectly without losing factual accuracy. The text fully adheres to all rules."
