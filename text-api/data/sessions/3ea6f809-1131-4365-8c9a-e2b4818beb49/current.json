    "text_translated": "Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail kicked up by the car as it drove to the Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, but they did not care about their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came to this place if he had to, which was fine by Sam. If he stayed away from his boss, he would keep his job for longer. Mr. Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt came together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise, he had the indoor tan of a man who earned money while other people worked.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6659 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a loss of the original text's core message or significant semantic nuance. While the factual information is largely preserved, several subtle lexical choices in the simplification alter the original's implications and vividness. For example, 'raked up' was changed to 'kicked up,' which slightly reduces the intensity of the dust trail's formation. More significantly, 'drew together' (referring to damp patches) was changed to 'came together,' which loses some of the active, almost artistic, quality of the original description. Finally, 'made money' was simplified to 'earned money,' which can subtly shift the perception of Mr. Carter's wealth acquisition from potentially passive or less direct means to one implying more direct labor or effort. These cumulative changes, though individually minor, dilute the original's characterization and atmospheric detail, leading to a lower semantic similarity score. To improve, focus on preserving the specific connotations and vividness of the original's vocabulary, even when simplifying sentence structure.",
