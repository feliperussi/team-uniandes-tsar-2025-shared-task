The original text states 'Otherwise he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.', describing Mr. Carter's complexion. However, the output incorrectly states 'However, he usually had pale skin, which showed that he earned money while other people did the work.' 'Indoor tan' and 'pale skin' are contradictory descriptions, fundamentally altering a key detail about Mr. Carter's appearance. This factual error also contributes to the low MeaningBERT score of 0.638, which is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a significant shift in the conveyed meaning regarding Mr. Carter's physical description and the implication of his lifestyle. To correct this, the simplification must accurately reflect the original description of 'indoor tan' or find a B1 equivalent that conveys a similar meaning without contradiction, such as 'he had a light tan from being inside' or 'his skin was not dark from the sun, showing he worked indoors'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6679 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a loss of core meaning or significant nuance from the original text. While the simplification maintains factual accuracy, several subtle phrasing changes cumulatively alter the original's precise meaning and tone. For instance, the original's direct characterization, 'the indoor tan of a man that made money,' was changed to 'an indoor tan, like a man who made money.' This shifts the description from a direct attribute of the tan (it is the tan *of* such a man) to a simile (it is *like* the tan of such a man), subtly altering the semantic relationship. Additionally, the direct internal thought 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job' was rephrased as 'Sam knew that the more he stayed away from his boss, the longer he would keep his job.' The addition of 'Sam knew that' and the change from the idiomatic 'kept out of his boss's way' to 'stayed away from his boss' slightly dilutes the immediacy and directness of Sam's internal monologue. To improve, ensure that simplifications retain the exact semantic relationship and directness of the original phrasing, even when simplifying vocabulary or sentence structure.",

To achieve a B1 level, this sentence could be simplified to something like: 'If he stayed out of his boss's way, he would keep his job longer.' Additionally, some sentences are quite long and contain multiple clauses, such as 'Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail, which a car was stirring up as it drove up to the Big House.' Breaking these into shorter, simpler sentences would help lower the CEFR level.

Furthermore, the sentence 'Otherwise, he had the indoor tan of a man who made money while other people did the work' is grammatically correct but its length and the combination of a relative clause and a subordinate clause make it quite dense for B1.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6619 is below the required 0.75 threshold. While the output largely preserves explicit factual information, there are several instances where the nuance, specific imagery, or idiomatic meaning of the original text has been diluted or lost, leading to a lower semantic similarity score. For example: 1. The original 'dust trail raked up by the car' is simplified to 'cloud of dust. A car was stirring it up'. The active, continuous image of 'raked up' is softened and split. 2. 'shapes in an atlas' is simplified to 'marks on a map'. 'Shapes in an atlas' evokes specific geographical features, whereas 'marks on a map' is more generic, losing the original's specific imagery. 3. 'ruddy' is simplified to 'red'. 'Ruddy' implies a healthy, reddish complexion, often with specific connotations, which is lost when replaced by the more general 'red'. 4. The comparative structure 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job' is simplified to a simple conditional 'If he kept away from his boss, he would keep his job for longer'. This loses the emphasis on the direct, continuous correlation implied by the original. 5. 'indoor tan' is simplified to 'tan of a man who stayed inside'. While descriptive, 'indoor tan' is a more concise idiom that carries specific connotations of lifestyle, which is somewhat diluted by the more literal explanation. These cumulative changes, though individually subtle, collectively reduce the overall semantic fidelity to the original text.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. The simplification did not sufficiently reduce the complexity of the original text. The MeaningBERT score (0.8583) and BERTScore (0.9767) indicate excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity, but the linguistic complexity remains too high for B1. For example, the sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he would have a job' uses a comparative conditional structure ('The more... the longer...') which is typically B2. Additionally, complex relative clauses like 'which the car was raking up as it drove' and 'who made money while other people did the work' contribute to the higher CEFR level. The simile 'The damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas' also presents a B2-level challenge. To achieve B1, these structures should be simplified. For instance, 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he would have a job' could be rephrased as 'If he stayed away from his boss, he would keep his job for longer.' Similarly, 'which the car was raking up as it drove' could be 'made by the car as it drove'. The simile could be simplified to 'The damp patches on his shirt looked like shapes on a map'.",

While the explicit factual information is largely preserved, the simplification process has diminished the descriptive richness and nuance of the original text, leading to a shift in its semantic representation. For example, the original's 'dust trail raked up by the car' was simplified to 'dust trail made by the car,' losing the specific action implied by 'raked up.' Similarly, 'damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas' became 'looked like shapes on a map,' which loses the dynamic verb 'drew together' and the slightly more specific 'atlas.' These changes, while simplifying, collectively reduce the vividness and specific imagery of the original, which the MeaningBERT model likely interpreted as a loss of core meaning. To improve, ensure that simplifications of descriptive language maintain as much of the original's specific imagery and dynamic action as possible, using B1-appropriate synonyms or rephrasing that preserves the original's evocative quality.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6659 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a loss of the original text's core message or significant semantic nuance. While the factual information is largely preserved, several subtle lexical choices in the simplification alter the original's implications and vividness. For example, 'raked up' was changed to 'kicked up,' which slightly reduces the intensity of the dust trail's formation. More significantly, 'drew together' (referring to damp patches) was changed to 'came together,' which loses some of the active, almost artistic, quality of the original description. Finally, 'made money' was simplified to 'earned money,' which can subtly shift the perception of Mr. Carter's wealth acquisition from potentially passive or less direct means to one implying more direct labor or effort. These cumulative changes, though individually minor, dilute the original's characterization and atmospheric detail, leading to a lower semantic similarity score. To improve, focus on preserving the specific connotations and vividness of the original's vocabulary, even when simplifying sentence structure.",
