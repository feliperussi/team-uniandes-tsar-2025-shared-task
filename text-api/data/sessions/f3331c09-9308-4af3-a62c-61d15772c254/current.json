    "text_translated": "Sometimes, we do not know why a bridge falls down. Engineers only understand the reason after they study the situation completely. In some cases, this happens because builders used bad materials. It can also happen because there was a problem with an important part of the bridge. In other situations, the bridge was designed to carry only a certain amount of weight and not more.",

    "feedback": "This text is an excellent example of B1 writing. You have successfully created a simple, connected text that is both clear and factually accurate. Your sentence structure is good, correctly using connectors like 'after' and 'because' to link ideas (e.g., 'Engineers only understand the reason after they study...'). This demonstrates the ability to form more complex sentences, which is a key B1 skill. Furthermore, your vocabulary choices are appropriate, effectively simplifying concepts like 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad materials' without losing the original meaning. The text is coherent and easy to follow.",
