        "feedback_text": "The submission fails because it uses a B2-level word, 'collapse', without defining it in the keywords section. The B1 assessment protocol is clear: 'Unexplained advanced vocabulary is a failure.' While the text demonstrates several B1 competencies, this violation of the core vocabulary rule is a critical error. On a positive note, the text shows a strong ability to paraphrase complex ideas into simpler B1 language. For example, replacing 'inferior-quality material' with 'bad material' and 'a defect in a key piece' with 'a problem with an important part' are excellent demonstrations of B1-level communicative skill. The use of connectors is also appropriate for this level, as seen in the sentence '...because bad material was used, or...there was a problem...'. The overall structure is coherent and factually accurate. To achieve a passing grade, the writer must ensure all vocabulary is within the B1 core, or any necessary B2 words are explicitly defined as keywords."

        "feedback_text": "This text is an excellent example of B1 writing. You have successfully created a simple, connected text that is both clear and factually accurate. Your sentence structure is good, correctly using connectors like 'after' and 'because' to link ideas (e.g., 'Engineers only understand the reason after they study...'). This demonstrates the ability to form more complex sentences, which is a key B1 skill. Furthermore, your vocabulary choices are appropriate, effectively simplifying concepts like 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad materials' without losing the original meaning. The text is coherent and easy to follow."
