    "text_translated": "In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young. This led to rapid population growth. These large families produced even more children who survived into adulthood and had their own children. But in the 1960s, it became easier for people to get contraception (ways to stop having babies). Because of this, the average number of babies born to each woman in the world declined. It went from six babies per woman to only two.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the target B1 level. The simplification strategy employed, particularly the splitting of complex sentences, has resulted in a text that lacks the grammatical complexity expected at B1. For example, the original sentence 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth' was split into two simpler sentences: 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young. This led to rapid population growth.' Similarly, the final sentence of the original was broken into three very short, direct sentences. While the parenthetical definition of 'contraception' is appropriate, the overall sentence structure and lack of B1-level connectors or more complex clauses push the text below the B1 threshold. To achieve B1, consider retaining some subordinate clauses or using a wider range of B1-level conjunctions and sentence structures, rather than always splitting sentences into their simplest forms.",
