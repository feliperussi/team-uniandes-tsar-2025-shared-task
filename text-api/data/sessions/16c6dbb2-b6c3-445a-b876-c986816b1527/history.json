Additionally, the explicit A1/A2 definition 'Contraception is a method to prevent pregnancy' and the use of the A1 connector 'So' contribute to the lower classification. The splitting of the final sentence from the original into three shorter, simpler sentences also reduces the overall B1 complexity.

While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT 0.8479, BERTScore 0.9536), the linguistic complexity was reduced beyond the B1 threshold. For example, the original sentence 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth' was split into two very simple A2-level sentences: 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young. This caused the population to grow quickly.' The use of 'This caused' is a simplification of the more complex participle clause 'fuelling'. Similarly, 'survived into adulthood' was simplified to 'grew up', and 'with the wider availability of contraception' was rephrased as 'it became easier to get contraception'. To achieve a B1 classification, the text needs to incorporate slightly more complex sentence structures, such as using relative clauses, more varied conjunctions (e.g., 'which led to', 'resulting in'), or more sophisticated phrasal verbs, without making it overly complex for B1. The current output is grammatically correct and clear, but it lacks the structural and lexical nuances expected at the B1 level.",

The simplification did not sufficiently reduce the complexity of the original text's sentence structures. For example, the first sentence, 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth,' uses a participle clause ('fuelling rapid population growth') which is typically a B2 structure. This could be simplified by splitting it into two sentences, such as '...died young. This led to rapid population growth.' Additionally, the third sentence is very long and dense, containing complex noun phrases like 'global average number of babies per woman' and the C1 vocabulary candidate 'availability'. To achieve B1, this sentence should be broken down into shorter, simpler sentences, and more complex vocabulary should be replaced or rephrased. The definition of 'contraception' was a good step, but it was not enough to bring the overall text to a B1 level.",
