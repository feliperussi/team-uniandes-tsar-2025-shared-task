Even though most people involved in world business speak English, communication, which is how we send and receive messages, can change a lot because of culture. Culture means the shared ideas, customs, and ways of behaving of a group of people. If we do not understand the customs and habits of the people we work with, it can cause unfair opinions, misunderstandings, and problems in communication. Etiquette, which is a set of rules for polite behaviour, is different in many places. Here are three basic ways in which business etiquette changes around the world, and knowing these can help you when you work with someone from another culture.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.664 is below the required threshold of 0.75. This indicates that the Writer's Output does not sufficiently preserve the core meaning of the Original Text. Specifically, the original emphasizes that business communication nuances and expectations differ greatly across cultures leading to potential unfair judgments and breakdowns. In contrast, the output alters nuances by adding definitional filler and slightly changes the tone, which dilutes the original message's impact about serious communication risks. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8992 falls just below the 0.90 minimum requirement, showing a noticeable loss of key phrases such as 'nuances and expectations', and 'breakdowns in communication' replaced with more generic wording, reducing lexical fidelity. To improve, the Writer's Output should maintain the strong emphasis on cultural differences causing communication failures and retain key phrases, while still simplifying language appropriately for B1. Also, recheck the choice and treatment of vocabulary candidates to better match original keywords without paraphrasing away essential meaning.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8517 and BERTScore of 0.9339 both comfortably exceed the required thresholds, confirming strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The text is correctly classified as B1, appropriate for the target CEFR level. The writer successfully simplifies some phrasing, uses B1-level vocabulary, and explains 'etiquette' clearly by adding 'rules of polite behaviour,' aiding comprehension without altering meaning. The structure is fluent, with varied sentence lengths and appropriate connectors, although the final sentence could be slightly tightened for smoother flow. To further enhance the output, consider using a few more explicit B1 connectors to improve cohesion and slightly reduce redundancy, for example by combining 'changes in many parts of the world' with the following sentence. Overall, this is a clear, accurate, and suitably simplified text that meets the requirements well.",
