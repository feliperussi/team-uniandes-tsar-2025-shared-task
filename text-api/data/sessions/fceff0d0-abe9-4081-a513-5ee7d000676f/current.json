If we don\u2019t understand the cultural customs and ways of working of the people we do business with, it can lead to unfair judgments, misunderstandings, and problems in communication. Business etiquette, which means the rules of polite behaviour, changes in many parts of the world. Here are three basic ways in which business etiquette differs around the world, and knowing these can help you when you work with someone from a different culture.",

    "feedback": "The output passes all priority checks with no factual errors; all key facts and relationships from the original text are preserved accurately. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8517 and BERTScore of 0.9339 both comfortably exceed the required thresholds, confirming strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The text is correctly classified as B1, appropriate for the target CEFR level. The writer successfully simplifies some phrasing, uses B1-level vocabulary, and explains 'etiquette' clearly by adding 'rules of polite behaviour,' aiding comprehension without altering meaning. The structure is fluent, with varied sentence lengths and appropriate connectors, although the final sentence could be slightly tightened for smoother flow. To further enhance the output, consider using a few more explicit B1 connectors to improve cohesion and slightly reduce redundancy, for example by combining 'changes in many parts of the world' with the following sentence. Overall, this is a clear, accurate, and suitably simplified text that meets the requirements well.",
