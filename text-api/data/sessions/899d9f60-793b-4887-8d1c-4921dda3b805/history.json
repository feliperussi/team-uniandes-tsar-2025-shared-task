        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is above the required A2 level. The failure is due to specific vocabulary and structural choices that are too advanced.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'worth' is B1 level. The sentence 'Recently people began to notice its worth as art' must be simplified. Suggestion: Rephrase to 'Recently, people began to see that it is important art'.\n\n- B1+ Vocabulary Violation: The word 'celebrated' is not an A2 word. It was copied from the original text instead of being simplified. Suggestion: Replace 'celebrated' with an A2 phrase like 'praised' or 'people should say good things about them'.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'She said artists who paint on the street just express themselves' uses a relative clause ('who paint...'). This structure is more common at B1 and contributes to the higher rating. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences. Example: 'She said some artists paint on the street. They just express themselves.'",

Factual integrity is maintained, all metric scores are within acceptable ranges (MeaningBERT: 0.84, BERTScore: 0.90), and the CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant.\n\nDiagnostic Audit:\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'recently' and 'express' are correctly used for A2. This is a pass.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is correctly broken down into short, simple, declarative sentences. This adheres to the A2 standard.\n- Meaning Nuance Degradation: The simplification of 'should be appreciated and celebrated' to 'People should like them' is a significant loss of meaning. The original conveys concepts of respect and public praise, while the output reduces this to simple preference. This is a notable weakness.\n- Verb Choice Weakness: The replacement of 'defended' (to speak in support of someone against criticism) with 'helped' (a general term) loses the specific context of the original statement.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: To better preserve the original meaning of 'appreciated and celebrated', rephrase to 'People should think their art is important and good.'\n- Suggestion: To better preserve the meaning of 'defended', rephrase 'She helped street artists' to 'She spoke for street artists.'",
