    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets the minimum requirements for the A2 standard. Factual integrity is maintained, all metric scores are within acceptable ranges (MeaningBERT: 0.84, BERTScore: 0.90), and the CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant.\n\nDiagnostic Audit:\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'recently' and 'express' are correctly used for A2. This is a pass.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is correctly broken down into short, simple, declarative sentences. This adheres to the A2 standard.\n- Meaning Nuance Degradation: The simplification of 'should be appreciated and celebrated' to 'People should like them' is a significant loss of meaning. The original conveys concepts of respect and public praise, while the output reduces this to simple preference. This is a notable weakness.\n- Verb Choice Weakness: The replacement of 'defended' (to speak in support of someone against criticism) with 'helped' (a general term) loses the specific context of the original statement.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: To better preserve the original meaning of 'appreciated and celebrated', rephrase to 'People should think their art is important and good.'\n- Suggestion: To better preserve the meaning of 'defended', rephrase 'She helped street artists' to 'She spoke for street artists.'",
