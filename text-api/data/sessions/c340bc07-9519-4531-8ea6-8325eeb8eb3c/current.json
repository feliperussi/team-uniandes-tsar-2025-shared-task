    "text_translated": "Sometimes, it is not clear why a bridge falls down. Engineers only understand the reason after they study everything carefully. This can happen because builders used bad materials to build the bridge. It can also happen because there was a problem with an important part of it. In other cases, the bridge was made to carry a certain amount of weight. It could not carry any more.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a perfect example of B1 writing. All sentences are short and clear. Complex ideas like 'inferior-quality material' and 'conduct a complete investigation' are correctly simplified to 'bad materials' and 'study everything carefully'. The text is factually accurate and uses appropriate B1 vocabulary and grammar.",
