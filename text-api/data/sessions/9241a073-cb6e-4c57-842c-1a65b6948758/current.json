    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6807 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text's concept of bridges being 'subject to intense scrutiny' was lost. Your replacement, 'experts must check every part of the bridge for problems,' changes the meaning from a constant state of being watched carefully to a specific action. This is a critical loss of meaning.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You introduced the B1-level word 'experts'. This word was not in the original text and is above the A2 level. All vocabulary must adhere to the A2 standard.\n- Structural Violation: The connector 'For this reason' is a B1 structure. A2-level connectors are limited to simple words like 'and', 'but', 'so', and 'because'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the final sentences to convey the idea that people watch bridges very carefully. Remove the word 'experts'. Replace 'For this reason' with 'So'.",
