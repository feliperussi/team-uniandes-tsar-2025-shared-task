This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text frames bridges within the context of 'transportation projects'. Your output completely omits this central concept. The original also describes bridges as 'crucial links', a key function that your text reduces to the generic phrase 'very important', losing essential meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8988 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing too many key terms. Words like 'transportation projects', 'crucial links', and 'intense scrutiny' were removed, not simplified, which damaged the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Vocabulary Error: The definition provided for 'civil engineering' uses the B1-level word 'planning'. A definition must only use words from the target level (A2) or below.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the core concepts of 'transportation' and 'links'. Re-introduce these ideas using simple A2 language. The simplification of 'intense scrutiny' to 'people watch them' is too weak; rephrase to convey the idea of checking for problems. Correct the definition of 'civil engineering' to remove the B1 word 'planning'.",

Your version weakens this connection into two separate statements: 'people check them very carefully' and 'This is very important because sometimes a bridge falls down'. The critical meaning that the risk of collapse is the reason for the scrutiny is lost.\n\n- The term 'intense scrutiny' implies a formal, rigorous process. While 'check them very carefully' is a valid A2 simplification, it contributes to the overall loss of meaning by downplaying the severity and formality of the original concept.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the cause-and-effect relationship.
