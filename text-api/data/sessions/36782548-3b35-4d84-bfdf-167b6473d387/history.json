While the submission is factually correct and preserves the original meaning excellently (MeaningBERT 0.90, BERTScore 0.94), the simplification was too aggressive. The primary reason for the A2 classification is the vocabulary. Key B1-level words like 'organising' and 'symbolic' were simplified to A2-level words 'sorting' and 'special'. Although the text is very clear, it lacks the lexical complexity expected for the B1 level. To improve, reintroduce one or two B1-level words from the original, such as 'symbolic meaning', as this term is central to the text's message and appropriate for the target audience.",

The C1-level word 'symbolic' was kept without simplification or definition. For a B1 text, this should be replaced with a phrase like 'with a special or hidden meaning'. Additionally, the first sentence is too long and complex due to the embedded definition of 'dreams'. Suggestion: Separate the definition into its own sentence to improve readability. For example: 'Dreams are pictures or stories our mind creates while we sleep. They may be the result of our mind organising our thoughts from the day.'",

The MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is highly effective. The writer successfully defined the keyword 'dreams' at the beginning, which is excellent practice. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'symbolic meaning' to 'special or hidden meaning', are perfectly suited for the B1 level. The restructuring of the final sentence using 'and' instead of 'while' improves readability without losing information. No major corrections are needed.",
