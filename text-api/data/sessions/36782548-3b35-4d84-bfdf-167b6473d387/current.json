    "text_translated": "Dreams are pictures or stories that our mind creates while we sleep. They may be the result of our mind putting together the thoughts we have during the day. They appear in sleep with a special or hidden meaning because the brain works differently at night. When we are awake, our thoughts usually appear in our mind as words, like a conversation we have with ourselves. When we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active, and the part that controls emotions becomes more active.",

    "feedback": "This is a strong submission that passes all checks. Factual integrity is maintained perfectly. The MeaningBERT (0.89) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is highly effective. The writer successfully defined the keyword 'dreams' at the beginning, which is excellent practice. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'symbolic meaning' to 'special or hidden meaning', are perfectly suited for the B1 level. The restructuring of the final sentence using 'and' instead of 'while' improves readability without losing information. No major corrections are needed.",
