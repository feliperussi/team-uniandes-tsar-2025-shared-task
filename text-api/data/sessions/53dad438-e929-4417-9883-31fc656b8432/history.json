However, this is not the real fact; a big change is actually happening. In the last twenty years, more than seven hundred million people have earned more money and have left poverty. This means they are no longer living in extreme poverty (poverty, which is not having enough money for basic needs). At the same time, six million fewer children die each year from disease. Many more girls can go to school, and many people now can get clean water.",

While the text is clear, it relies heavily on A1/A2 vocabulary (e.g., 'big change' for 'transformation', 'earned more money' for 'increased their income') and uses very simple sentence structures. This combination has lowered the overall complexity below the B1 level. To elevate the text to B1, consider reintroducing slightly more complex vocabulary or combining some of the shorter sentences. For example, instead of 'Many more girls can go to school, and many people now can get clean water,' you could write 'Additionally, millions more girls are now able to attend school and more people have access to clean water.' On a positive note, the submission successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with excellent scores on MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.93). The definition provided for the keyword 'poverty' was also clear and well-integrated.",

While the submission passed the critical checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation, its linguistic features were not complex enough for the target audience. The sentence structures, particularly in the first half, are characteristic of an A2 level. For example, 'Most people think that in developing countries there is extreme poverty, dictators and little hope for change' is a very direct and simple construction. To elevate the text to a solid B1, consider using more B1-level grammatical structures to connect ideas. For instance, the first two sentences could be combined using a subordinating conjunction: 'Although most people think developing countries face extreme poverty, this perception is misleading because a significant transformation is taking place.' This revision introduces a complex sentence structure appropriate for B1 while maintaining clarity. The definition of 'poverty' was a positive addition.",

The primary reason for this is the use of advanced sentence structures and vocabulary. For example, the first sentence is very long and complex: 'Although most people think that developing countries are characterised by extreme poverty, dictators and little hope for change, this perception is misleading because a significant transformation is taking place.' This sentence should be split into two or three shorter sentences. Additionally, several B2 and C1 level words were used instead of simpler alternatives, such as 'perception' (use 'idea'), 'misleading' (use 'wrong'), 'transformation' (use 'big change'), and 'additionally' (use 'also'). While the text successfully preserved the original meaning and defined the keyword 'poverty', it failed the core task of simplifying the language to a B1 level.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all numbers and key concepts accurately transferred from the original text. This is supported by excellent MeaningBERT (0.90) and BERTScore (0.94) metrics, well above the required thresholds. The CEFR B1 classification is correct. The handling of the keyword 'poverty' is a model of good practice; the parenthetical definition '(not having enough money for basic needs)' is clear, concise, and perfectly integrated. Vocabulary choices are strong, effectively replacing complex terms like 'great transformation' with the more accessible 'big change' without losing the core message. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. No corrections are required.",
