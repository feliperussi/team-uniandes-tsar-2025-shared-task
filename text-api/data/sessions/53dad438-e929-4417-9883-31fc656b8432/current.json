    "text_translated": "Most people think that developing countries are full of extreme poverty, dictators and little hope for change. This idea is wrong because a big change is happening. Over the last twenty years, more than seven hundred million people have increased their income and have moved out of poverty (not having enough money for basic needs). Also, six million fewer children die each year from disease, millions more girls can go to school, and millions of people now have clean water.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that meets all B1 requirements. The output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all numbers and key concepts accurately transferred from the original text. This is supported by excellent MeaningBERT (0.90) and BERTScore (0.94) metrics, well above the required thresholds. The CEFR B1 classification is correct. The handling of the keyword 'poverty' is a model of good practice; the parenthetical definition '(not having enough money for basic needs)' is clear, concise, and perfectly integrated. Vocabulary choices are strong, effectively replacing complex terms like 'great transformation' with the more accessible 'big change' without losing the core message. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. No corrections are required.",
