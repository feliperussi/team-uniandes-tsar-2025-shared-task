    "text_translated": "Many large supermarkets have been criticised for various bad actions over the last ten years. They have wasted a lot of food, they have underpaid their suppliers, and they have used too much plastic packaging, which has had an impact on our environment. But supermarkets and food shops are starting to sit up and take notice. In response to growing consumer backlash (a strong negative reaction) against the huge amount of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging, some of the largest UK supermarkets have committed to changing their packaging and reducing plastic waste.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.9586) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The simplification strategy is well-executed. Complex phrases like 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' were effectively simplified to 'been criticised for various bad actions'. 'Tonnes of food' became 'a lot of food', and 'contributed to excessive plastic waste' was simplified to 'used too much plastic packaging'. The term 'grocers' was appropriately replaced with 'food shops'. The keyword 'backlash' was correctly defined in parentheses, which is an excellent strategy for B1 learners. The overall flow and structure of the text are clear and coherent, using B1-appropriate connectors and sentence structures. This is a high-quality simplification that meets all requirements.",
