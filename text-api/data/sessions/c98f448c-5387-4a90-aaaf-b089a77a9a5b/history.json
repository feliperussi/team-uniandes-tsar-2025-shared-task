They have wasted a lot of food, they have not paid their suppliers enough money, and they have used too much plastic packaging, which has had a bad effect on our environment. But now, supermarkets and food shops are starting to pay attention. Customers are showing a strong negative reaction, or `backlash`, against the huge amount of plastic rubbish that comes from packaging. Because of this, some of the biggest UK supermarkets have agreed to change their packaging and reduce the amount of plastic they use.",

While the text largely preserves factual information and lexical fidelity (as indicated by the BERTScore of 0.932), the MeaningBERT score suggests a subtle loss or alteration of the core message's nuance. Specifically, the original text's phrase 'signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' conveys a strong, formal commitment and an ambitious goal. The simplified output 'agreed to change their packaging and reduce the amount of plastic they use' is factually correct but may slightly dilute the strength of this commitment. The term 'pact' implies a more formal agreement, and 'transform' suggests a more significant change than simply 'change'. To improve, consider retaining a stronger sense of the original's commitment and formality, perhaps by using phrases like 'made a formal agreement to greatly change' or 'committed to transforming' to better capture the original's emphasis.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. The primary reason for this classification is the use of the word 'cutting' in the phrase 'cutting plastic waste'. According to the provided Vocabulary Candidates, 'cutting' is a C1 level word. To achieve a B1 level, this word should be replaced with a simpler alternative such as 'reducing' or 'lessening'. Additionally, phrases like 'unethical acts' and 'transforming their packaging' could be simplified further to 'bad actions' or 'changing their packaging' respectively, to ensure a more robust B1 classification. The definition provided for 'backlash' was a good strategy for B1 comprehension, but the overall vocabulary choice needs to be more consistently B1.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.9586) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The simplification strategy is well-executed. Complex phrases like 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' were effectively simplified to 'been criticised for various bad actions'. 'Tonnes of food' became 'a lot of food', and 'contributed to excessive plastic waste' was simplified to 'used too much plastic packaging'. The term 'grocers' was appropriately replaced with 'food shops'. The keyword 'backlash' was correctly defined in parentheses, which is an excellent strategy for B1 learners. The overall flow and structure of the text are clear and coherent, using B1-appropriate connectors and sentence structures. This is a high-quality simplification that meets all requirements.",
