    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8809) and BERTScore (0.941) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text's content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating successful targeting of the desired complexity level. The writer effectively handled the keywords 'Hunger Games' and 'Capitol' by providing clear, concise definitions within the text. Vocabulary candidates were managed appropriately; 'lottery' was simplified to 'by chance', which is a good A2-level replacement. The retention of B1-level words like 'remind', 'district', 'battle', and 'survive' is correct for the target CEFR level. The sentence structure was simplified by splitting longer sentences, improving readability without losing information. For example, the original first sentence was split into two, and the third sentence was also expanded, which aids comprehension for a B1 audience. The use of relative clauses for definitions ('which is a special competition', 'which is the main city') is also appropriate for B1. The overall flow is natural and coherent. The only minor point for consideration is the retention of 'are being punished', where 'being' is classified as B2. While this specific phrase is common enough to be understood at B1, exploring alternative phrasings for passive constructions in future simplifications could further refine the text for a strict B1 audience, though it does not detract from the overall success of this output.",
