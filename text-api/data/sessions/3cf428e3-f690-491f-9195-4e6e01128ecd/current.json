    "text_translated": "Religion (a set of beliefs about God or spiritual matters) is very important to Pi. Although his family follows Hinduism, he is curious about other religions and he becomes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. To everyone's surprise, Pi explains that he is Hindu, Muslim and Christian simultaneously. When his family and teachers ask him to choose only one religion, Pi refuses, because he only wants to love God. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him decide for himself about his religion.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.90 and BERTScore of 0.96 are very high, confirming that the core meaning and key details were successfully preserved. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of vocabulary was strong, particularly the successful in-text definition of the keyword 'Religion' and the effective simplification of the idiom 'make his own mind up' to 'decide for himself'. For future improvement, consider replacing the C1-level adverb 'simultaneously' with a more common B1 phrase like 'at the same time' to enhance accessibility even further. Overall, this is a high-quality submission.",
