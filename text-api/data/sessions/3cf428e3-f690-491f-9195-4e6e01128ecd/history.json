When his family and teachers ask him to choose only one religion, Pi refuses, because he only wants to love God.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. The simplification was too aggressive. While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning, it over-simplifies key vocabulary. For example, 'declares' (B2) was simplified to 'says' (A1) and 'simultaneously' (C1) was simplified to the A1 phrase 'at the same time'. This resulted in a text that is too simple for the B1 level. To correct this, consider using B1-level alternatives instead of A1-level ones. For instance, instead of 'Pi says that...', you could use 'Pi explains that...'. This would raise the lexical complexity back to the target B1 level without sacrificing clarity.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.90 and BERTScore of 0.96 are very high, confirming that the core meaning and key details were successfully preserved. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of vocabulary was strong, particularly the successful in-text definition of the keyword 'Religion' and the effective simplification of the idiom 'make his own mind up' to 'decide for himself'. For future improvement, consider replacing the C1-level adverb 'simultaneously' with a more common B1 phrase like 'at the same time' to enhance accessibility even further. Overall, this is a high-quality submission.",
