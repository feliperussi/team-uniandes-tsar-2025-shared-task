The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Structural Simplification: The text excels at simplification. The original complex sentence 'Suzanne says that the two things start to merge...' was correctly broken down into simple, independent sentences, removing the B1-level 'that-clause'.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is almost entirely within the A1/A2 range. The B1 word 'reality' is acceptably used within the common phrase 'reality show' and placed in quotes. The simplification of 'disturbing' to 'strange and bad' is an effective A2-level paraphrase.",
