One type was a show about real people. In these shows, young people tried to win a million dollars. The other shows were news about the war. Suzanne says the two ideas mixed together in her head. This was a strange and bad feeling. Then, she had the idea for The Hunger Games.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The output meets all requirements of the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: The text is a factually correct simplification of the original source. No information was lost or altered.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.93 are well above the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of the core message.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classifies as A2. The simplification of the B1-level 'that-clause' from the original was executed correctly.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. The sentence structure is consistently simple. The breakdown of the complex phrase 'merge together in a disturbing way' into two simple sentences ('mixed together in her head. This was a strange and bad feeling.') is a model of A2 simplification.",
