    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about genes. We want to know how they are important for our brain and our language. Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a gene that changed a long time ago. This happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a very similar gene, but their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. DNA is the thing in our bodies that has all our genes. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is a flawless A2 text. The writer correctly identified and defined the key terms 'gene' and 'DNA' in simple, understandable language. All sentences are short, declarative, and use basic A2 grammar. Complex concepts like 'mutation' and 'influence' were accurately simplified to 'change' and 'how important'. The passive voice in the original ('answers might be found') was expertly changed to the active voice ('we might find'), which is a perfect adaptation for the A2 level. No errors detected.",
