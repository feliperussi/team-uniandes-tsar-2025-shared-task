All sentences are short, declarative, and use basic A2 grammar. Complex concepts like 'mutation' and 'influence' were accurately simplified to 'change' and 'how important'. The passive voice in the original ('answers might be found') was expertly changed to the active voice ('we might find'), which is a perfect adaptation for the A2 level. No errors detected."
