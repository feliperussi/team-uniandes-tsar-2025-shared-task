    "text_translated": "Pi and Richard Parker spend 227 days in the lifeboat, and during this time, they experience hunger, sickness, and tiredness. They also suffer through very strong storms and the very hot sun of the Pacific Ocean, but somehow they manage to stay alive. Sometimes, Pi finds comfort in his three religions, but at other times, he feels very lonely and sad. Finally, the Mexican coast appears on the horizon, and everything changes for them. It would be a pity to tell you the end of the story, so you will have to read the book yourself to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when they finally see land.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - No factual errors were found. All numbers, names, and key events from the original text are accurately represented in the simplified output. For example, '227 days' and 'Mexican coast' are correctly preserved.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.7987 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.964 is also well above the 0.90 threshold, showing strong lexical and factual fidelity to the original text.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis - The simplification strategy is highly effective.\nStructure and Flow: The text maintains a natural flow, using appropriate B1 connectors such as 'and during this time,' 'They also,' 'Sometimes... but at other times,' and 'Finally.' Sentence structures are clear and accessible for a B1 learner.\nVocabulary Strategy: The writer successfully simplified several phrases and words. For instance, 'illness and exhaustion' became 'sickness, and tiredness,' 'endure violent storms' became 'suffer through very strong storms,' and 'overcome with loneliness and despair' was effectively simplified to 'feels very lonely and sad.' The phrase 'once land is in sight' was also well rephrased to 'when they finally see land.' The term 'horizon' was retained, which is acceptable as it is a specific and often understood term in context, and did not push the text beyond B1.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent simplification that adheres to all guidelines, making it highly suitable for a B1 audience while preserving all essential information.",
