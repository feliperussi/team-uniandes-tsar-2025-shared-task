The original text has a strong, argumentative tone (e.g., 'It is society, not nature...'), which your version weakens into simple statements ('Society tells girls...'). This dilution of meaning is a critical error.\n\nAdditional Violations:\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2-level word 'unappealing' was copied directly into the A2 text. This is a severe error.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 phrase 'career path' was used. This is too complex for A2.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence '...a person who travels in space as a man' uses a relative clause ('who'). This structure is borderline for A2 and should be avoided.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Rephrase sentences to restore the original text's strong meaning. The text is not just stating facts; it is making an argument.\n- Remove the word 'unappealing'. Replace it with an A2 phrase like 'a bad job' or 'not interesting work'.\n- Replace 'career path' with the A2 word 'job'.",

It should be 'role models'.\n\nSuggestion: Retain more specific vocabulary from the original text while keeping sentences short.
