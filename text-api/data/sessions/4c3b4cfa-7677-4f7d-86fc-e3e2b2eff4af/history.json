This substitution weakens the core meaning of desperation and extreme danger, resulting in the low MeaningBERT score.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The word 'diplomat' is C1 level and is not acceptable for A2. Your attempt to define it using 'This means...' introduces the B2-level word 'means' and a meta-linguistic structure that is too complex for this level.\n\nStructural Violation: The sentence 'This means he worked for his country in other countries' is a defining clause, which is a B1-level structure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by using stronger, A2-appropriate adjectives. Replace the entire concept of 'diplomat' with a simple description of the job. Rephrase 'Martel's father was a diplomat. This means he worked...' to 'Martel's father worked for his country in other countries.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6986 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The text was over-simplified to the point of losing critical connections between ideas.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The primary failure is the low MeaningBERT score. The text is factually correct but has lost the narrative connection of the original.\n- The original text states Pi is 'shipwrecked and finds himself trapped'. Your version breaks this single event into a list of separate facts: 'His ship sinks... He is on a small boat... He cannot leave the boat'. This fragmentation destroys the immediate and singular concept of being 'trapped'.\n- The text is excessively choppy. The sequence of short, disconnected sentences reads like a list of facts, not a story summary. This damages the narrative flow present in the original.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Reconstruct the text to restore logical links. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to join ideas. The sentence 'His ship sinks, so he is trapped on a small boat with a dangerous tiger' is a single, coherent event.\n- Suggestion: Do not break down one core concept into multiple, disconnected sentences. The goal is simplification, not fragmentation.",
