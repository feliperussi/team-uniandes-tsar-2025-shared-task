    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. It meets all requirements of the protocol without deviation.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: The output is factually identical to the original text. All names, numbers, and key events are correctly preserved.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.94 confirm that meaning and key terms were successfully retained.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly registers as A2, demonstrating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly controlled at the A1/A2 level. Complex concepts like 'diplomat' were expertly rephrased into simple, understandable A2 terms ('worked for his country in other countries'). Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic A2 connectors. The text is a textbook example of successful simplification.",
