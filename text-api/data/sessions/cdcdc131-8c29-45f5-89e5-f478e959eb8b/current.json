It maintains factual integrity, preserves the original meaning (MeaningBERT 0.7637) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.9127), and is correctly classified as A2 by the CEFR classifier. The vocabulary is strictly A2, with complex terms like 'rainforest' effectively simplified to 'big forest with much rain'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using basic conjunctions like 'and'. No deviations from the A2 standard were found.",
