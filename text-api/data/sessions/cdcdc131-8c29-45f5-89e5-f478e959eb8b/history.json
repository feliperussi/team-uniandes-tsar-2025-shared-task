While the MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics are acceptable, and the CEFR classifier rated the text as A2, a deep qualitative audit reveals critical vocabulary issues. Specific deviations include: The word 'rainforest' is classified as B1. For A2, this term should either be defined in simpler A2 vocabulary (e.g., 'a big forest with much rain') or replaced with a simpler phrase. The word 'cutting' in 'cutting down' is classified as C1. This is significantly above the A2 level. A simpler verb or phrase must be used (e.g., 'destroying' or 'making disappear'). Suggestion: Replace 'rainforest' with an A2-level description. Replace 'cutting down' with an A2-level equivalent like 'destroying' or 'stopping the trees'.",

These changes, while aiming for simplicity, collectively reduce the fidelity of the original meaning. \n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'used' is identified as B1 in the provided vocabulary list, but it is used multiple times in the text (e.g., 'He used a radio', 'He used this to speak').\n- Vocabulary: The word 'charities' is a B1 word (e.g., 'nature charities', 'children's charities'). This must be simplified to an A2 equivalent, such as 'groups that help people' or 'groups that help nature'.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'blog' is likely above A2 level. Consider rephrasing to 'he wrote a short story online' or 'he wrote notes on the internet'.\n\nSuggestion: Review the text for areas where simplification has led to a loss of specific detail or nuance. Rephrase sentences to maintain the core meaning more closely while adhering to A2 vocabulary and grammar. Replace B1 vocabulary with simpler A2 alternatives.",
