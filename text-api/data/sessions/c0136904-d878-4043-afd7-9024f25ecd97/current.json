    "feedback": "This is an excellent B1 submission. Your ability to construct long, complex sentences is a clear strength. For example, you correctly used a relative clause ('which was published in 2001') and a connector of result ('as a result') to link ideas smoothly and accurately. The vocabulary is appropriate for the level, and all facts from the original text have been preserved perfectly. This text fully demonstrates the B1 competence to write connected text.",
