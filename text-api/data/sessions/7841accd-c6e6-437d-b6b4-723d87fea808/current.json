    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards. It accurately preserves the factual information and core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8126 and a BERTScore of 0.9304, both well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely appropriate for an A2 level, with no B1 or higher words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate terms like 'But' and 'Also'. This is an exemplary simplification to the A2 level.",
