        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Vocabulary Audit. The text contains a B1-level word, 'poverty', which is not compliant with the A2 standard. The original text's concept of 'poverty' must be rephrased using only A2 vocabulary, such as 'not having much money' or 'being poor'. Additionally, there is a grammatical error in the sentence 'six million less children die from sickness every year'. For countable nouns like 'children', the correct word is 'fewer', not 'less'. While 'less' is an A2 word, its incorrect application demonstrates a lack of grammatical precision required even at the A2 level. Suggestion: Replace 'much poverty' with 'not much money' or 'being very poor'. Correct 'less children' to 'fewer children'.",

It accurately preserves the factual information and core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8126 and a BERTScore of 0.9304, both well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely appropriate for an A2 level, with no B1 or higher words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate terms like 'But' and 'Also'. This is an exemplary simplification to the A2 level.",
