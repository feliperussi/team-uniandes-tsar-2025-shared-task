    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7493 is below the required 0.75, showing loss of core nuance. For example, replacing \u201cshipwrecked\u201d with \u201cbig ship sinks at sea\u201d weakens the sense of disaster and trapping. Suggestion: Restore key terms like \u201cshipwrecked\u201d and emphasize Pi\u2019s entrapment to recover the original meaning.",
