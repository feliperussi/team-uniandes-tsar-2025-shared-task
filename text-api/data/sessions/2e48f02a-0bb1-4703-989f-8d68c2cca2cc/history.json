The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. There are no B1 or higher-level words present.\n- Structural Simplicity: The original text's complex sentences have been successfully broken down into short, simple structures appropriate for the A2 level. Connectors used are limited to A2 standards.\n- Keyword Definition: The definition provided for 'etiquette' as 'the polite rules for the things we do with other people' is an excellent example of simplification using A2 vocabulary.\n\nWhile the text is a strong pass, the sentence 'But what people think will happen in business is different from culture to culture' uses a noun clause ('what people think will happen') as the subject, which is at the absolute upper limit of A2 structural complexity. This is the only point preventing a perfect score.",
