The ways people do business are not the same.\nWe do not always understand the normal ways of another culture. This can cause big problems. People can think bad things about others. This is not fair. Sometimes, talking to each other stops completely.\nEtiquette is the polite rules for the things we do with other people. Here are three simple ways things are not the same in business etiquette. This can help you when you work with someone from a different culture.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8976 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This is the primary reason for failure.\n\n- The text fails because it has lost too much lexical detail from the original. The simplification, while achieving an A2 classification, was too aggressive.\n- Key phrases from the original like 'global business community', 'nuances and expectations', and 'breakdowns in communication' were replaced with overly general terms such as 'business people', 'ways people do business', and 'talking to each other stops completely'. This loss of specific vocabulary caused the fidelity score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n- While the MeaningBERT score of 0.7984 is acceptable, the low BERTScore indicates that the way the meaning was conveyed was too different from the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to increase lexical fidelity. Reintroduce key concepts from the original using simple A2 phrasing. For 'breakdowns in communication', consider 'communication can stop or become very difficult'. This improves fidelity without violating A2 vocabulary or structural rules.",
