While the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, it failed to meet the core simplification requirement. The B2 classification is likely due to a combination of advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures. The text uses the B2 word 'flexible' and the C1 word 'appreciation'. Furthermore, sentences like 'Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff, and they should also provide more positive feedback and show appreciation for the work they do' are compound-complex and exceed typical B1-level syntax. To correct this, replace advanced vocabulary (e.g., 'show appreciation for' could become 'praise') and split long, complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones.",

While the submission passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores (MeaningBERT: 0.94, BERTScore: 0.96), it failed on the critical CEFR compliance requirement. The B2 classification is likely due to the retention of complex sentence structures from the original text. For example, the sentence 'As part of this, we should look for ways to offer more choice in working hours and consider how we can allow employees to work from the locations they choose' is a long, compound-complex sentence that is too advanced for B1. Suggestion: To achieve a B1 level, break these longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones. The example sentence could be rewritten as: 'We should look for ways to offer more choice in working hours. We should also consider allowing employees to work from the locations they choose.'",

The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved with high fidelity. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was excellent. Complex sentences from the original were effectively split into shorter, more readable sentences. Vocabulary choices were superb; for instance, the complex concept of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was skillfully simplified to the more accessible 'positive feedback and praise', and 'intercultural communication' was appropriately reduced to 'communication skills' for a B1 audience. No improvements are necessary.",
