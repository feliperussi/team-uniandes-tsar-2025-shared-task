As part of this, we should look for ways to offer more choice in working hours. We should also consider allowing employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff. They should also provide more positive feedback and praise the work they do. We should also invest more money in professional development, especially in social and communication skills. This could help to create a positive environment where employees can do their best work.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.95) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved with high fidelity. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was excellent. Complex sentences from the original were effectively split into shorter, more readable sentences. Vocabulary choices were superb; for instance, the complex concept of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' was skillfully simplified to the more accessible 'positive feedback and praise', and 'intercultural communication' was appropriately reduced to 'communication skills' for a B1 audience. No improvements are necessary.",
