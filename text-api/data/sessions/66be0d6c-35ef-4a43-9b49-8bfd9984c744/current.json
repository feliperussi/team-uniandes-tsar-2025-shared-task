    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6874 is below the required 0.75. The core message's strength and the causal relationships from the original text have been significantly diluted. For example, the original's 'danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel' implies a direct consequence, which is weakened by splitting it into 'this is a big danger. When we are more connected, we feel more separate.' Similarly, 'at the expense of learning the art of real conversation' is a strong statement of trade-off, which is softened to 'But this means they do not learn real conversation.' The nuanced argument of the original is lost in the simplification.\n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'risk' is classified as B1 but was used directly without simplification or replacement. For A2, this concept should be rephrased, e.g., 'This is a bad thing that could happen.'\n- Vocabulary: The word 'means' is classified as B2 but was used directly without simplification or replacement. For A2, this concept should be rephrased, e.g., 'Because of this, they do not learn...'\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the strength of the original's causal links and the impact of its arguments. Replace B1/B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 alternatives.",
