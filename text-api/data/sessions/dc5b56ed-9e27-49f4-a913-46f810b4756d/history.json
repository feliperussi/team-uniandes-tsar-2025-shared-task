While the simplification maintained factual integrity and meaning, the vocabulary and sentence structures were consistently simplified to an A2 level. For example, 'the other languages combined' was simplified to 'all other languages together', 'spoken in the highest number of countries' to 'used in the most countries', and 'by far the greatest number' to 'many more'. To achieve a B1 classification, the text needs to incorporate more B1-level vocabulary and slightly more complex sentence structures while remaining clear. For instance, 'combined' could be retained, or 'spoken in the highest number of countries' could be kept as is, as it is already B1 appropriate. The phrase 'little correlation' could be maintained or replaced with a B1 synonym like 'weak relationship' instead of 'only a small connection'.",

The text also correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification effort was minimal, with only a slight rephrasing in the final sentence ('how many native speakers there are of a language' to 'the number of native speakers a language has'). This change is appropriate for B1. The word 'correlation' (C1 candidate) is present in both the original and output. While the CEFR classifier still rated the text as B1, for a stronger B1 simplification, consider replacing 'correlation' with a simpler synonym like 'connection' or 'relationship' in future tasks. Overall, an accurate and compliant output, though the original text was already quite accessible.",
