    "feedback": "PASS: The output successfully maintains factual integrity, meaning, and fidelity to the original text, as evidenced by the high MeaningBERT (0.9453) and BERTScore (0.9929) metrics. The text also correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification effort was minimal, with only a slight rephrasing in the final sentence ('how many native speakers there are of a language' to 'the number of native speakers a language has'). This change is appropriate for B1. The word 'correlation' (C1 candidate) is present in both the original and output. While the CEFR classifier still rated the text as B1, for a stronger B1 simplification, consider replacing 'correlation' with a simpler synonym like 'connection' or 'relationship' in future tasks. Overall, an accurate and compliant output, though the original text was already quite accessible.",
