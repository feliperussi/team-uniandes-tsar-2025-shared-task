This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.

Key lexical items were lost.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The words 'dirt' and 'otherwise' are not on the A2 list. They must be removed.\n- B1 Structural Violation: The sentence 'He looked at a far dry-dirt path made by the car' uses a passive adjectival phrase ('made by the car'), which is a B1 structure.\n- Grammatical Error: The text contains two sentence fragments: 'The more Sam stayed away from his boss.' and 'The longer he kept his job.' This is unacceptable.\n- Unnatural Phrasing: The phrase 'if not-needed' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. It fails to clearly convey the original meaning.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'if not-needed' to a correct A2 structure like 'if he did not need to'.\n- Suggestion: Remove the B1 words 'dirt' and 'otherwise'. Replace 'dirt' with an A2 word like 'ground'.\n- Suggestion: Combine the sentence fragments into a complete A2 sentence. Example: 'When Sam stayed away from his boss, he could keep his job for longer.'\n- Suggestion: Split complex sentences. 'He looked at a far dry-dirt path made by the car' must become two simple sentences. Example: 'He looked at a path far away. The car made the path.'",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job' describes a direct conditional relationship. Your version, 'Sam stays away from his boss. He can keep his job longer,' breaks this into two simple statements, losing the essential cause-and-effect meaning.\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8748 is below the 0.90 minimum. This fidelity loss is caused by replacing too many key descriptive words ('squinted', 'dust trail', 'drew together') with overly generic terms.\n- Tertiary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. The use of the conjunction 'unless' in 'Mr Carter does not come out here unless he needs to' is a B1-level grammatical structure. This is an unacceptable deviation.\n- Structural Error: The systematic change from past tense to present tense is a fundamental alteration of the narrative voice and is not a simplification.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence containing 'unless' to use A2 structures. Example: 'Mr Carter only comes here when it is important.' Restore the conditional meaning. Example: 'If Sam stays away from his boss, his job is safe.' You must adhere strictly to A2 vocabulary and grammar.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on multiple high-priority checks. The primary failure is the inability to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.63 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of meaning. The BERTScore of 0.86 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key vocabulary and phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.63): The original text's sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job' conveys a specific conditional relationship. Your version, 'Sam knew he must stay away from his boss. He did this to keep his job,' is a simple statement of fact that loses this nuanced, cause-and-effect meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.86): Key descriptive phrases like 'damp patches on his shirt drew together like shapes in an atlas' were over-simplified to 'Wet spots on his shirt looked like shapes on a map,' contributing to the low fidelity score.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification was caused by specific grammatical structures that are too advanced for the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'He got money while others worked' uses the subordinating conjunction 'while'. This is a B1 structure. It must be simplified using A2 connectors like 'and' or split into two sentences.\n\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The phrase 'from staying inside' uses a gerund after a preposition, which is a B1 structure.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'dust' is classified as B1 vocabulary and was used without simplification or definition.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Remove the B1 conjunction 'while'. Rephrase the sentence 'from staying inside' using a simple clause. Replace the B1 word 'dust' with an A2-level description. Re-evaluate sentence structures to ensure the logical connections from the original text are not lost during simplification.",

These are unacceptable deviations.\n\n- Meaning Loss Through Fragmentation: The original text links ideas together. For example, Mr. Carter's 'indoor tan' is directly connected to him being a man who 'made money while other people did the work'. Your version, 'He had a light tan from inside. He made money. Other people worked', breaks this into three disconnected facts, destroying the original meaning.\n\n- Suggestion: You must rephrase using only A2 vocabulary. Replace 'trail' with 'road' or 'path'. Describe 'dusty' using simple words, such as 'The road had a lot of dust'. Reconnect the fragmented sentences to restore the cause-and-effect relationships from the original text. For example: 'He had a tan from being inside because he made money and other people did the work outside.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.5992, which is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core meaning and descriptive atmosphere. The text was reduced to a list of simple facts, stripping it of its narrative quality.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's description of heat, distance, and character relationships was lost. The phrase 'squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail' became 'looked at the sun' and 'saw a road far away', which fails to convey the character's experience.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8643 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing specific, descriptive words ('squinted', 'trail', 'damp patches', 'atlas', 'ruddy') with generic A2 terms, losing lexical fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The output was classified as B1, not the target A2. This is due to the inclusion of B1-level grammatical structures. The sentence 'He made money while other people worked' uses a 'while' clause, and 'Mr Carter only came out if he had to' uses a conditional 'if' clause. These are too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'dust' was used directly. All vocabulary must conform to the A2 level.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. The goal is simplification, not elimination of meaning. The concept of 'indoor tan' must be explained more clearly, for example: 'His skin was not dark from the sun. He worked inside.'\n\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 grammar. Break complex sentences using 'while' or 'if' into two separate, simple sentences. For example: 'Mr Carter did not like to come out. He only came when it was important.'\n\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'dust'. Use an A2 phrase like 'dirt in the air'.",

This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message. The text also fails on multiple subsequent checks.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text implies Sam's cautious, survival-based relationship with his boss. Your version, 'Sam was happy to stay away from his boss', changes this core meaning from fear/caution to simple preference, which is a factual misrepresentation of the character's motivation.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8983 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a result of replacing specific vocabulary like 'atlas' and 'ruddy', which reduced lexical fidelity to the source.\n\n- Tertiary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The classification is correct due to the use of B1-level grammatical structures.\n\n- Grammatical Deviations: You used a 'that-clause' in 'The horses did not care that their owner...'. You used a participle clause in '...a car going to the big house'. You used the subordinator 'while' in '...while other people did the hard work'. These are all B1 structures and are not permitted.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the original meaning of Sam's motivation. Do not state he was 'happy'; state that staying away was necessary for his job. Eliminate all B1 structures. Break complex sentences into simple A2 sentences. Example: 'The horses did not care. Their owner had not visited for ten months.' Example: 'He made money. Other people did the hard work.'",

The BERTScore of 0.8746 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity due to excessive simplification.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The text was broken down into so many short, disconnected sentences that the relationships between ideas were destroyed. The original's cause-and-effect statement, 'The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job,' is not captured by the two separate, weak sentences: 'Sam stayed away from his boss. This was needed for his job.'\n\n- Nuance Loss: The description of Mr. Carter's 'indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work' implies a specific lifestyle. Your version, 'He also had a light colour on his skin. He made money. Other people did the hard work,' states facts but loses the crucial implication that connects them.\n\n- Structural Failure: While the goal is simple sentences, your output is a list of disjointed statements, not a coherent paragraph. This is not acceptable A2 writing; it is a failure of communication.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and', 'so', and 'because' to link related ideas.
