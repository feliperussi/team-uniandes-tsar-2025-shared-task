This bomb can blow up the asteroid. This sounds like an idea from a movie. The movie Armageddon was about this.\n\nBut it is a real idea from NASA. It is a plan with a long name. The name is Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER). They would send eight-ton rockets to the asteroid. They hope to hit the asteroid. This will push it onto a new path.\n\nBut sometimes the asteroid is very near Earth. Then this plan will not work. So the rockets will carry special, very strong bombs. They will use these bombs to blow up the asteroid.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 requirements.\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and aligns with the original text.\n- Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8255 and BERTScore of 0.9036 are above the required thresholds, confirming meaning and fidelity are preserved.\n- CEFR Classification: The text was correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly controlled. The complex concept of a 'nuclear weapon' is correctly paraphrased into simple A2 terms ('special, very strong bomb'). Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic A2 connectors. The submission is flawless.",
