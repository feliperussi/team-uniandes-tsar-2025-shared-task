The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n- Factual Integrity: The output is 100% factually consistent with the original text.\n- Metrics: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.84 and BERTScore at 0.93 confirm high fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. Simplifications such as 'frightening experience' to 'scary time' are executed perfectly. Sentence structure is ideal, using short, simple sentences and basic A2 connectors ('so', 'but'). No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",

The text uses vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for this level.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score (0.8421) and BERTScore (0.9309) are well above the minimum thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- Vocabulary Audit: The simplification of B1-level vocabulary is flawless. 'Upsetting' was correctly changed to 'sad'. 'Frightening' was correctly changed to 'scary'. 'Protect' was correctly changed to 'keep her safe'. The use of the B1 word 'Force' is acceptable as it is part of the proper noun 'US Air Force'.\n- Structural Analysis: The writer successfully deconstructed complex sentences into short, simple statements connected by appropriate A2 conjunctions ('so', 'but'). The result is clear and highly readable for an A2 audience.",
