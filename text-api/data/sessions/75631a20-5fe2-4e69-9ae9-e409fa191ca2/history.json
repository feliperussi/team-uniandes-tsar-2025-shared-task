        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.608 is well below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a poor preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8557 is also below the 0.90 minimum required, showing significant lexical losses and factual phrasing alterations. Key terms like 'punished for rebelling' were simplified to 'punish the districts,' losing the important nuance of cause and effect. The original's emphasis on the Hunger Games as a punitive reminder is diluted and partially lost. The text also modifies core ideas with oversimplifications, e.g. 'The Capitol is the big city' erases the political power aspect. Vocabulary includes B1 words like 'district,' 'punish,' and 'lottery' that are noted as not A2-level and cause lexical discrepancy. Sentence structures, while simple, strip crucial detail, reducing message fidelity. The CEFR classifier result is A2, but due to meaning and lexical fidelity failures, this is misleading. Suggestion: Reintegrate the cause-effect relationship of punishment for rebellion explicitly to restore factual integrity. Replace or explain B1 terms with A2-level vocabulary directly related to original meaning. Use more precise simple phrases preserving the original authoritative tone of 'Capitol' and the disciplinary purpose of the Games. Improve lexical overlap and meaning preservation before confirming compliance.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score is 0.6364, which is well below the required threshold of approximately 0.75. This indicates a significant loss of the original core message. Specifically, the original text emphasizes the Hunger Games as a punishment by the Capitol for rebellion, but the writer's output softens this to 'punish the districts because they tried to fight the Capitol,' which slightly changes the political weight and intent. Also, the phrase 'the Capitol is the main city' inaccurately simplifies 'Capitol' from the original text, which is a proper noun referencing the seat of power, not just a 'main city.' Furthermore, the complex concept of a deadly battle is simplified to 'fight each other' without conveying 'only one person can survive' as a brutal survival event with the same explicitness. Although the BERTScore of 0.9151 passes, the meaning loss due to oversimplifications and inaccurate representations causes failure. Although the CEFR classifier rated the text as A2, the vocabulary includes multiple B1-level words such as 'punish,' 'district,' and a missing proper explanation for 'Capitol' causes ambiguity. Also, some sentences such as 'The Capitol is the main city' are awkward and not fully accurate. Suggestion: Maintain the political punishment context explicitly, clarify 'Capitol' as the place of power, and restore the gravity of 'only one person can survive' with simple but precise phrases. Avoid introducing inaccuracies like calling the Capitol merely a city and preserve the original message's intensity.",
