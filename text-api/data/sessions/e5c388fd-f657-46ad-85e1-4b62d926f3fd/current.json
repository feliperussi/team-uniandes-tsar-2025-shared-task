    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks that fly through space. Some of these rocks can be dangerous. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' if they pass close to our planet. This means they come within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's path around the sun.\n\nNASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids. But none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects. They can also say if one might hit Earth. If this happens, there are two ways to protect our planet.",
