NASA is a space group from the USA. NASA has made a map with 1,400 of these asteroids. NASA does not think any of these rocks will hit Earth in the next 100 years. NASA uses technology to watch these asteroids. It can see where they go and say if they might hit us. If needed, NASA can send two ways to stop the rocks from hitting Earth.",
