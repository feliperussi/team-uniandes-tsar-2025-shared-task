This is an instant failure.\n\n- The core meaning of the original text was lost. The original describes a proactive strategy: councils 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly'. Your version, 'leaders do not want artists to paint everywhere', is a simple negative statement. It fails to capture the essential concept of encouragement.\n- You added a definition, 'Graffiti is pictures or writing on walls.' This sentence does not exist in the original text. Adding new information, even for simplification, is a deviation that contributed to the low meaning preservation score.\n- The word 'subway' was removed from 'subway trains'. This is a minor but unnecessary loss of factual detail.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original meaning. The goal is to stop random graffiti by providing an alternative, not just to state a negative desire. Do not add definitions that are not in the source material. A better sentence would be: 'Some city leaders want to stop artists from painting on all the walls, so they give them special areas to paint in.'",

B1 words like 'council' and 'designated' were correctly simplified to 'leaders' and 'special'.
