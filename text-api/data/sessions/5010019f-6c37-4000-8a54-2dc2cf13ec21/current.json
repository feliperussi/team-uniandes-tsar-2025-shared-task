All key information regarding Taiwan and S\u00e3o Paulo is preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8337 and BERTScore of 0.9431 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids complex structures and vocabulary that would elevate it to B1.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. B1 words like 'council' and 'designated' were correctly simplified to 'leaders' and 'special'. The B1 concept 'subway trains' was effectively explained using a simple A2 structure: 'trains that go under the city'. Sentence structure is simple and direct, adhering to A2 norms.",
