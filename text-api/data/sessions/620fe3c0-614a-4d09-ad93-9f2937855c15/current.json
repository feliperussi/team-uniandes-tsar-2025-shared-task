Engineers are people who plan and build things like bridges. \n\nEarthquakes can break many things. They can break bridges too. But bridges falling down because of earthquakes does not happen very often. New bridges are stronger. Engineers plan new bridges in places where earthquakes happen. They make bridges that can stand strong and not move much during an earthquake.",
