    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8809 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original.\n1. The phrase \"Unlike many other best-selling album artists\" was reduced to \"He is one of the best-selling album artists,\" removing the contrasting emphasis.\n2. The combined idea \"chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game\" was split into separate sentences, losing the linked nuance.\n3. \"most fundamental stories\" was changed to \"most important stories,\" which weakens the original meaning.\nSuggestion: Reinstate the full contrasting phrase \"Unlike many other best-selling album artists\".\nSuggestion: Preserve the compound construction \"chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game\".\nSuggestion: Restore the term \"fundamental\" to maintain the original nuance.",
