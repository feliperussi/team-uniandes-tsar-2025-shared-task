Meagan McGrath from Canada, for example, has climbed the highest mountain on each continent, cycled across Canada and run a long-distance race in the Sahara Desert in 45\u00baC heat. However, her most special journey was probably a skiing trip to the South Pole, which is the most southern point on Earth. On the very first day, she fell into a glacier and had to be saved. Although many people would have stopped at that point, Meagan decided to continue. She reached the South Pole forty days later, after pulling a sledge with her tent and all her food through very cold weather and ice storms.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all names, numbers, and events correctly transcribed. The MeaningBERT (0.77) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The handling of the keyword 'South Pole' is a model of good practice; embedding the definition 'which is the most southern point on Earth' is a fluent and effective strategy. Vocabulary substitutions are consistently excellent, such as changing 'remarkable' to 'special' and 'rescued' to 'saved'. The use of B1 connectors like 'However' and 'Although' improves the text's flow and readability. This is a high-quality submission with no recommended changes.",
