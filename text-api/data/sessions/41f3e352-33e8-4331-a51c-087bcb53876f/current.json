    "text_translated": "Asteroids are large rocks that fly through space. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous' when they are close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. NASA has created a map of 1,400 of these asteroids, but they do not believe any of them will be a danger in the next one hundred years. With today's technology, NASA can follow these objects and predict if they might hit our planet. If this happens, two different defence plans could be used to protect us.",

It is direct, cites specific evidence for the failure ('`CEFR_Classifier_Result` is 'B2', which does not match the `Target_CEFR_Level` of 'B1''), and clearly explains the consequence according to the protocol. The 'FAIL' status and grade of 1 are perfectly justified by this clear explanation.",
