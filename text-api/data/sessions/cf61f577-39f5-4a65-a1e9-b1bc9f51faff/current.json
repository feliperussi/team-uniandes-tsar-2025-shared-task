So, I talked to my boss, and we agreed that I could change my working week to three days. This meant that my pay was much less, because I am paid only for the hours I work. However, I have noticed that the amount of work I have to do has not become less at all. Now I do five days' worth of work in just three days, but I get paid much less for it.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks, demonstrating excellent factual integrity, meaning preservation, and fidelity to the original content. The MeaningBERT score of 0.771 and BERTScore of 0.9433 are well above the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, indicating appropriate linguistic complexity. The simplification effectively rephrased more complex terms and phrases such as 'parental leave' to 'time off to look after my children', 'negotiating' to 'talked to my boss', and 'paid on a pro-rata basis' to 'paid only for the hours I work'. The use of connectors like 'So,' and 'However,' contributes to a clear and logical flow, making the text very accessible for a B1 learner. The vocabulary choices are consistently appropriate for the target level. This is a very strong simplification.",
