    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic protocols have been successfully met. The text demonstrates unwavering adherence to the CEFR A2 readability standard. Factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning is preserved, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7976 and a BERTScore of 0.9138. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2-level, with complex terms from the original text appropriately simplified (e.g., 'hero' to 'main character', 'refuses' to 'says no to', 'adventure' to 'journey', 'enemies' to 'bad people', 'challenge' to 'hard test'). The keyword 'mentor' was effectively defined as 'helpful friend'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, utilizing A2-appropriate connectors such as 'but', 'so', and 'and'. No deviations from the rigorous protocol were detected.",
