        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6961 is below the required 0.75. The core message of the hero's journey, particularly the symbolic stages, has been significantly diluted. While the BERTScore of 0.9088 indicates good lexical fidelity, the deeper meaning is lost. Specific deviations are detailed below. Deviation 1: Meaning Loss - 'cross the threshold'. The original text emphasizes a specific, symbolic act of commitment to the adventure. Your version 'chooses to go' loses this crucial nuance and the concept of entering a distinct, 'special world' with a clear boundary. This is a key element of Campbell's monomyth. Suggestion: Rephrase to convey the idea of entering a new, distinct phase or world, perhaps 'The hero decides to go into a new, special place. This is a big step.' Deviation 2: Meaning Loss - 'passing tests'. The original 'passing tests' implies specific challenges designed to prove the hero's worth. Your simplification 'does hard things' is too generic and loses the specific nature of these trials. Suggestion: Rephrase to 'The hero does many difficult tests' or 'The hero must pass many hard tests'. Deviation 3: Meaning Loss - 'biggest challenge'. The original 'biggest challenge' implies an ultimate, defining struggle. Your 'biggest problem' is less impactful and does not convey the same sense of a transformative ordeal. Suggestion: Rephrase to 'They are going to meet their biggest fight' or 'They will face their hardest test'. Deviation 4: Added Content. The initial definition 'A mentor is a person who helps you. They teach you things.' is not present in the original text. While defining keywords is sometimes acceptable, here it disrupts the flow and adds content that was not part of the original narrative, contributing to the lower MeaningBERT score. The original text describes the mentor's role within the journey, which is sufficient. Suggestion: Remove the introductory definition of 'mentor'. The text should focus on simplifying the original narrative, not adding new information.",

The core message regarding the structured 'stages' of the hero's journey, as presented by Campbell, has been significantly diluted and lost in the simplification. The original text explicitly states 'The next stage consists of...', which conveys a structured process. Your version fragments this into disconnected actions, losing the essential concept of a sequential journey. The specific meaning of 'cross the threshold' is also lost, replaced by a generic 'go into a special world' and an interpretive addition 'This is a big step' which was not present in the original.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6898 is too low. The text fails to convey the structured nature of Campbell's hero's journey, particularly the concept of distinct 'stages'.\n- Vocabulary Deviation (B1): The word 'mentor' is a B1 level word. It must be replaced with an A2 equivalent, such as 'teacher' or 'helper'.\n- Vocabulary Deviation (C1): The word 'Solo' (from 'Han Solo') is a C1 level word. While a proper noun, its inclusion without simplification or context for an A2 audience is problematic if not handled carefully.\n- Interpretive Addition: The sentence 'This is a big step' is an interpretation added by the writer and is not present in the original text. A2 simplification must preserve the original meaning without adding new interpretive layers.\n- Loss of Specificity: The phrase 'cross the threshold' is a key concept in Campbell's work. While simplification is necessary for A2, replacing it with 'go into a special world' and adding 'This is a big step' loses the specific, symbolic meaning of 'crossing the threshold'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to explicitly convey the idea of sequential 'stages' or 'steps' in the hero's journey. Replace 'mentor' with an A2 equivalent. Reconsider the phrasing for 'cross the threshold' to better capture its significance at an A2 level without adding new interpretations. Ensure all proper nouns are presented in a way that is accessible to an A2 learner.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and the nuanced relationships between its parts. The original text describes a continuous, interconnected 'hero's journey' with specific causal and temporal links between stages. Your simplification breaks these into many short, disconnected sentences, which fragments the narrative coherence. For example, the original's single sentence 'but a mentor appears who helps them and they decide to 'cross the threshold' and travel into the 'special world' where the adventure happens' is split into five separate sentences in your version. This weakens the logical flow and the subtle connections between events. Additionally, the specific, metaphorical concept of 'crossing the threshold' is reduced to the more literal 'go into a special world', which, while simpler, loses some of the original's intended meaning and impact. The text passed the BERTScore for lexical fidelity and the CEFR classifier for A2 linguistic complexity, but the core meaning was not adequately preserved. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the logical flow and causal relationships between events, even with simple vocabulary. Combine related ideas using simple connectors like 'and', 'but', 'so', or 'because' to improve narrative coherence. Ensure that key conceptual steps, even when simplified, retain their significance.",
