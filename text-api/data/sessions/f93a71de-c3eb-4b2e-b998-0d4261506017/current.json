    "text_translated": "Scientists are studying genes to see if a change in them gave humans the ability to speak. Researchers have found a special gene, which is a part of our DNA that controls how a person develops. This gene changed between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, and this change seems to be connected to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not change in this way. It is still too early to say how much genes affect language, but the answers might one day be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is a strong B1 performance. The text successfully passes the preliminary metrics check. The writing demonstrates excellent B1 competence in structure and flow, effectively using connectors to create well-formed sentences (e.g., '...a special gene, which is a part of our DNA that controls...'). The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for the B1 level; the required keyword 'gene' was correctly identified and defined simply and accurately within the text. Factual accuracy is maintained throughout, successfully summarizing the key points of the original source. The grade of 9 reflects a high level of control and clarity.",
