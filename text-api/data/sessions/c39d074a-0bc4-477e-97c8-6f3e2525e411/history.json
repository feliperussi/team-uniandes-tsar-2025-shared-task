NASA has made a map of 1,400 PHAs, and none of them are expected to be a threat in the next one hundred years. With technology that already exists, NASA can track these objects and predict if an impact might happen, and if that time comes, two defence options could be launched.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' rather than the target 'B1'. For example, the opening sentence uses the B2-level word 'Potentially' and the phrase 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit', which is a complex prepositional phrase with a large numeral. The final sentence uses the B2 term 'defence options'. To reach B1 level, replace 'Potentially' with 'Possibly', simplify 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit' to 'up to 7.5 million kilometres from Earth\u2019s path', and change 'defence options' to 'ways to defend'. Also split longer sentences into shorter ones. For example: 'NASA has made a map of 1,400 PHAs. None of them will be a threat in the next one hundred years.' These changes will help align the text with B1 grammar and vocabulary requirements.",
