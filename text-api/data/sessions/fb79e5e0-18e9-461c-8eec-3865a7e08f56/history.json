        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. The submission passes the highest priority checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation with excellent scores. However, the simplification was too effective, reducing the linguistic complexity below the B1 level. The original text's first complex sentence ('Writing about your dreams will mean...') was broken down into two simpler sentences using structures more characteristic of the A2 level ('If you write...' and '...because they might...'). To correct this, the text needs to be revised to include slightly more complex sentence structures or B1-level connectors to meet the target complexity without sacrificing clarity.",

The high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.96) confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The key strength of this submission is its structural simplification. The writer skillfully combined the last two sentences from the original text using 'and then', creating a more fluid and connected idea. Furthermore, the first sentence was effectively rephrased using a subordinate clause ('When you write...') and a relative clause ('...which might also add...'), demonstrating a strong command of B1-level sentence construction. This is a high-quality simplification.",
