    "feedback": "The output is an excellent example of B1 simplification and passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.96) confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The key strength of this submission is its structural simplification. The writer skillfully combined the last two sentences from the original text using 'and then', creating a more fluid and connected idea. Furthermore, the first sentence was effectively rephrased using a subordinate clause ('When you write...') and a relative clause ('...which might also add...'), demonstrating a strong command of B1-level sentence construction. This is a high-quality simplification.",
