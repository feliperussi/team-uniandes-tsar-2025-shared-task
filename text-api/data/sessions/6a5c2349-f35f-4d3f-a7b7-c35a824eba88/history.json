The MeaningBERT score of 0.5997 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8879 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. While the individual facts are present, the deeper meaning and specific lexical choices are not adequately preserved for an A2 simplification. The strong causal link between the failure of international projects and Wasfia's unique, self-reliant approach is diluted. The depth of her 'dedication' and the specific goal of 'changing attitudes' are simplified to a degree that loses fidelity. For example, 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' was simplified to 'gave her life to helping people with these rights', losing the specific lexical meaning of 'dedicated' and 'supporting'. 'Numerous international humanitarian projects' was reduced to 'many projects from other countries', losing the detail of 'numerous', 'international', and 'humanitarian'. 'Stand up for itself' was simplified to 'help its own people', which alters the original's emphasis on self-reliance. 'Brought together two of her passions' became 'loved two things... She used these two things', which is less precise. 'Attitudes towards women' was simplified to 'how people think about women', losing the specific term 'attitudes'. 'Never set eyes on a mountain' was simplified to 'never saw a mountain', losing the idiomatic expression. These lexical changes, while aiming for simplicity, collectively reduce the fidelity and the precise meaning of the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain a stronger causal connection between Wasfia's observations and her motivations. Ensure that key concepts like 'dedication', 'supporting', 'humanitarian', 'self-reliance', and 'attitudes' are conveyed with greater lexical precision, even within A2 constraints, to improve both meaning preservation and fidelity.",

The BERTScore of 0.8911 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. \n\nSpecific Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text's emphasis on 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' and 'witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects' is diluted to 'spent her life working for human rights' and 'saw many projects from other countries'. This simplification loses the active, committed, and observational aspects of Wasfia's role. The phrase 'once too often' was completely removed, losing the critical nuance of repeated project failures.\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The strong imagery of 'Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself' is weakened to 'Bangladesh needed to help itself'. The active and impactful phrase 'sitting up and taking notice' is reduced to 'paying attention', which diminishes the sense of significant impact and recognition.\n- BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items were replaced or omitted, leading to the low score. Examples include 'dedicated her life to supporting' replaced by 'spent her life working for', 'witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects' replaced by 'saw many projects from other countries', 'in her homeland' replaced by 'in her country', 'educate and train' simplified to 'taught', 'once too often' removed entirely, 'stand up for itself' replaced by 'help itself', 'passions' replaced by 'loved two things', 'humanitarian campaigns' replaced by 'helping people', 'never set eyes on a mountain' replaced by 'never saw a mountain in their life', and 'fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice along with the rest of the world' significantly altered to 'People in her country are paying attention. People in other countries are also paying attention.'. These changes, while simplifying, remove too much of the original's specific vocabulary and phrasing.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Restore the nuance of Wasfia's dedication and observation. Use A2-appropriate synonyms that convey a stronger sense of commitment and witnessing, rather than just 'working for' or 'saw'.\n- Reintroduce the concept of repeated failure implied by 'once too often' using simple A2 language.\n- Maintain stronger lexical connections to the original text where possible, even with simplification. For example, find an A2 way to express 'humanitarian projects' or 'campaign' that is closer to the original meaning than 'projects from other countries' or 'plan'.\n- Ensure that simplified phrases like 'paying attention' do not lose the active and impactful meaning of phrases like 'sitting up and taking notice'.",

The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, falling below the required thresholds for both MeaningBERT and BERTScore. This is a critical failure at Priority 2 of the diagnostic protocol. The text cannot be considered an accurate A2 simplification if it loses significant meaning or lexical detail.  MeaningBERT score of 0.6478 is below the required 0.75. This indicates a significant loss of the original message's nuance and impact. For example, 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' was simplified to 'gave her life to help human rights', which loses the strength of 'dedicated' and 'supporting'. The specific nature of 'humanitarian projects' was diluted to 'projects from other countries' or 'human rights projects', losing the 'humanitarian' aspect. The idiomatic expression 'doing the trick' and 'sitting up and taking notice' were replaced with less impactful phrases like 'Her plan is working' and 'People in her country are really noticing'.  BERTScore of 0.8948 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Specific terms like 'dedicated', 'supporting', 'numerous', 'humanitarian', 'passions', 'mountaineering', 'attitudes', 'campaigns', 'coastal', 'primarily', 'set eyes on', 'doing the trick', and 'sitting up and taking notice' were either removed or replaced with less precise synonyms, impacting the lexical fidelity. For instance, 'mountaineering' was replaced by 'mountain climbing', 'passions' by 'strong loves', and 'attitudes' by 'how people feel'.  Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the strength of 'dedicated' and 'supporting'. Ensure 'humanitarian' is conveyed more accurately. Find A2-appropriate ways to convey the impact of 'doing the trick' and 'sitting up and taking notice' without losing their essence. Review the original text for key vocabulary and ensure more precise A2 equivalents are used to maintain lexical fidelity.",

The BERTScore of 0.8964 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: The phrase 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' is weakened to 'worked all her life for human rights', losing the intensity of 'dedicated' and 'supporting'. 'Witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects' is simplified to 'saw many projects that helped people', which loses the specificity of 'numerous', 'international', and 'humanitarian'.

'Brought together two of her passions, mountaineering and human rights' is simplified to 'had two big loves: climbing mountains and human rights. She put these two loves together', losing the more sophisticated term 'passions' and the directness of 'brought together'. 'Change attitudes towards women' is simplified to 'change how people think about women', losing the specific term 'attitudes'.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6334 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8903 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key lexical items and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: The original phrase 'witnessed numerous international humanitarian projects' is reduced to 'saw many projects from other countries', losing the specific nature and scale of the projects. The strong concept of 'Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself' is weakened to 'Bangladesh needed to help itself', diminishing the sense of agency and the original phrasing. The term 'passions' is replaced by 'loves', which is less intense and specific to the context of dedicated life pursuits, impacting the meaning. The nuanced phrase 'change attitudes towards women' is simplified to 'change how people think about women', losing the specific social and cultural implication of 'attitudes'. The idiomatic and impactful 'Her campaign seems to be doing the trick as fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice' is diluted to 'Her plan is working well. People from her country are really noticing', losing the active engagement implied by 'sitting up and taking notice' and the formal nature of 'campaign'. Suggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification process to ensure that core concepts and the strength of the original message are preserved, even when using simpler vocabulary. Do not dilute the meaning for the sake of simplicity. Suggestion: Focus on retaining key nouns and verbs that carry significant meaning, even if other parts of the sentence are simplified. For example, 'international humanitarian projects' could be simplified to 'many big projects from other countries to help people' rather than just 'many projects from other countries'. Suggestion: Ensure that idiomatic expressions, when they convey strong meaning, are translated into A2-appropriate language that still captures their essence, rather than being completely lost.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6401 is well below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.8837 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a substantial loss of original meaning and specific phrasing. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The introductory paragraph, 'Human rights are about how people should live.

The task is to simplify the provided text, not to add new information or definitions. This significantly alters the content and focus, directly contributing to the low MeaningBERT and BERTScore.\n- The simplification of 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' to 'spent her life helping human rights' loses the intensity of 'dedicated' and the specific action of 'supporting'.\n- Key lexical items such as 'witnessed', 'numerous', 'international', 'humanitarian', 'passions', 'mountaineering', 'attitudes towards', 'campaign', 'doing the trick', and 'sitting up and taking notice' were either omitted or replaced with less precise or weaker terms, leading to the low BERTScore.\n- The nuance of 'needed to stand up for itself' is diluted by 'needed to be strong for itself. It needed to help its own people.', losing the implication of self-reliance.\n- The idiomatic expression 'sitting up and taking notice' is simplified to 'paying attention. They are starting to care.', which loses the stronger sense of sudden realization or importance conveyed by the original.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Remove the entire introductory paragraph defining human rights. The task is to simplify the given text, not to expand upon it with external definitions.\n- Focus on preserving the specific actions and motivations of Wasfia as presented in the original text, using A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures.\n- Ensure that simplifications retain the core meaning and intensity of the original phrases, rather than diluting them. For example, find A2 ways to convey 'dedicated' or 'passions' without losing their impact.",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance.\n\nSpecific Deviations:\n- The original text's emphasis on the systemic and repeated failure of projects, conveyed by 'once too often', is diluted by the simpler phrase 'This happened many times'. This loses the critical implication of a recurring problem.\n- The core message of 'change attitudes towards women' was simplified to 'change how people treat women'. 'Attitudes' implies a deeper, internal shift in perspective, which is a more profound change than merely altering external 'treatment'. This significantly weakens the intended impact of Wasfia's work.\n- The active and impactful success described by 'Her campaign seems to be doing the trick as fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice' is reduced to the more passive 'Her big plan is working well. People in her country are now paying attention. They are seeing it.' The sense of active engagement and the effectiveness of the campaign is diminished.\n- The word 'treat' is classified as B1. Its use in 'change how people treat women' is a deviation from the strict A2 vocabulary standard.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the section about projects stopping to accurately convey the systemic and repeated nature implied by 'once too often' using A2 vocabulary.\n- Restore the concept of 'attitudes' or a similar A2-level phrase that conveys a deeper internal shift in perception, rather than just external actions, when describing the change Wasfia seeks.\n- Use stronger, more active A2-level phrases to convey the success and active engagement of the campaign, ensuring the impact is not diminished.\n- Replace the B1 word 'treat' with an appropriate A2 alternative to maintain CEFR A2 vocabulary compliance.",
