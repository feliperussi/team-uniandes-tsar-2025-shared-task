    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.646 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuanced meaning through oversimplification. While the general narrative is present, critical semantic details have been diluted or removed. Specific deviations include: The phrase 'dedicated her life to supporting human rights' was reduced to 'gave her life to help human rights', losing the active, continuous commitment implied by 'dedicated' and 'supporting'. The crucial descriptor 'humanitarian' was omitted from 'international humanitarian projects', which significantly alters the nature of the projects described. The assertive meaning of 'needed to stand up for itself' was weakened to 'needed to help itself'. The intensity of 'passions' was reduced to 'strong interests'. The specific and impactful phrase 'campaign seems to be doing the trick as fellow countrymen and women are sitting up and taking notice' was simplified to 'big plan is working. People in her country are now paying attention. They are really noticing it.', losing the idiomatic strength and the specific term 'campaign'. Suggestion: Reintroduce key descriptive vocabulary that conveys the specific nature of Wasfia's work and the projects. Ensure that the emotional and assertive tone of the original is maintained, even with simpler words. Do not strip away essential semantic information for the sake of simplicity.",
