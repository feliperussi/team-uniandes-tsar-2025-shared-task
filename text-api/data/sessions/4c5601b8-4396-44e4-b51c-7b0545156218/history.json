Each year, one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 are chosen from each district in a lottery. These teenagers are called tributes. They are sent to a large area where the Games take place. There, they must fight until only one person lives. This shows the Capitol has total control over the nation. The Games are shown on TV, and everyone must watch them.",

The MeaningBERT score (0.825) and BERTScore (0.9348) both exceed the required thresholds, and the CEFR classifier correctly labels the text as B1. To refine the text further, consider combining some of the very short sentences for improved flow (for example, merge \u201cThe Capitol organizes the Hunger Games each year. It does this to show the districts they are punished for rebelling.\u201d into one sentence). Vary your connectors by adding simple linking words (because, so, then) to reduce choppiness. You might also replace phrases like \u201ca large area where the Games take place\u201d with \u201cthe arena\u201d to introduce more varied vocabulary while still at the B1 level. Finally, ensure that any interpretive sentences (for instance, \u201cThis shows the Capitol has total control over the nation\u201d) clearly reflect information stated in the original rather than adding new inferences.",
