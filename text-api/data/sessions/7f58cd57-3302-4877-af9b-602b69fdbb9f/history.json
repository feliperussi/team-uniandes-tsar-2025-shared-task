This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text makes a strong argument about how society pushes false and damaging stereotypes. Your version weakens this message into a simple description. The phrase \"unfortunate perception\" is lost, and the concept of science being an \"unappealing career path\" is diluted to \"not a good job for them\". The core meaning was not preserved.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8941 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a result of replacing key factual phrases like \"positive female role models\" and \"greater sense of belonging\" with overly simple terms, losing important lexical detail from the source.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word \"lonely\" is classified as B1 level. It was used in the output but was not included as a defined keyword. All vocabulary must adhere to the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original's stronger meaning about false ideas and their negative impact. Replace the B1 word \"lonely\" with an A2 alternative, such as \"they work alone\".",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for the low MeaningBERT score is the structural change in the introduction. Your output begins with a general definition of stereotypes. The original text begins by stating the specific stereotype about girls and boys in science. This change alters the focus and flow of the argument, resulting in a loss of meaning.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8903 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects a loss of key words and phrasing from the original source.\n- A severe vocabulary error was made. You introduced the word 'damaging', which is a C1-level word. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Start by directly simplifying the original opening sentence. Do not add a general definition. Remove the C1 word 'damaging' and replace its concept with A2 vocabulary, for example: 'These ideas are wrong and cause problems.' Ensure all key concepts from the original are present in the simplified version.",
