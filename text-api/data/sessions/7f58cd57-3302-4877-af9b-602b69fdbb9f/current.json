    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6789 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text. The original text places direct blame on society for creating stereotypes. Your version weakens this critical point by using more neutral phrasing like 'This idea comes from people' instead of preserving the original's stronger statement. This loss of nuance is a critical failure. Factual Detail Loss: The original phrase 'arts and humanities' was reduced to just 'art'. This is an unnecessary loss of information. Tonal Shift: The original uses stronger, more critical language like 'unfortunate perception' and 'unappealing career path'. Your version simplifies this to 'wrong ideas' and 'not a good job', which loses the negative emphasis and critical tone of the source material. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the original's emphasis on societal fault. The language must more accurately reflect the critical tone of the source text regarding stereotypes and their negative impact. Ensure all key concepts from the original, like 'humanities', are included.",
