    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to show people what happens when they do not follow the rules. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area by lottery. This means the choice is by chance. The children are 12 to 18 years old. They call these children 'tributes'. Tributes are the people who must fight in the games. Only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. Factual accuracy is maintained. Sentence structure is simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly A1/A2. The writer correctly identified the B2 word 'lottery' as essential and provided an immediate, simple A2-level definition ('This means the choice is by chance'). The keyword 'tributes' was also defined effectively. The B1 concepts of 'punished' and 'battle' were expertly rephrased using A2 vocabulary. No corrections are necessary.",
