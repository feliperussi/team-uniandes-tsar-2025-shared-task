While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9304, BERTScore: 0.9761), the vocabulary choices and phrasing leaned too heavily towards a simpler level. For example, the original 'upsetting' was changed to 'troubling', 'protect her' to 'keep her safe', and 'frightening experience' was simplified to 'feel very afraid'. These are all valid simplifications but collectively push the text into the A2 band. To achieve a B1 level, consider retaining or introducing slightly more sophisticated B1 vocabulary where appropriate, or varying sentence structures to include more complex B1 conjunctions or clauses, while still ensuring clarity and avoiding overly simplistic phrasing.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.936 and BERTScore of 0.9829 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the writer made a subtle but effective structural improvement by splitting a longer sentence from the original into two, using 'However' to introduce the second part and integrating the final clause with 'which was a very frightening experience for her'. This enhances readability and flow for a B1 audience without oversimplifying the content. No keywords were identified for definition, and the existing vocabulary was appropriate for the B1 level, so no replacements were necessary. This is a well-executed simplification.",
