    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. There were no factual errors detected. The MeaningBERT score of 0.936 and BERTScore of 0.9829 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the writer made a subtle but effective structural improvement by splitting a longer sentence from the original into two, using 'However' to introduce the second part and integrating the final clause with 'which was a very frightening experience for her'. This enhances readability and flow for a B1 audience without oversimplifying the content. No keywords were identified for definition, and the existing vocabulary was appropriate for the B1 level, so no replacements were necessary. This is a well-executed simplification.",
