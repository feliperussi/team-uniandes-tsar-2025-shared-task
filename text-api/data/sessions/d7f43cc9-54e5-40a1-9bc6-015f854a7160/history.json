This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text presents a concise historical fact about the high susceptibility of wood bridges to fire. Your output transforms this into a simple narrative, which, while factually correct, loses the original's emphasis and nuance. The concept of being 'much more susceptible' is diluted to 'could catch fire easily' and 'a big problem', which does not carry the same weight. The addition of a definition for 'spark', while a valid simplification technique, is extraneous information not present in the source and further contributes to the deviation in meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the original's focus on cause and effect. The text must more closely mirror the original's statement of fact rather than becoming a story.
