    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an annual event, which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for fighting against the government. Every year, one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 are chosen from each district by lottery to compete in a battle where only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\", which are the people selected to fight in the games. The whole nation is forced to watch the event on television.",

    "feedback": "Excellent work. This submission is a clear PASS and serves as a model for B1 simplification. It successfully passed all priority checks: Factual Integrity, Meaning Preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.87, BERTScore: 0.98), and CEFR Compliance (B1). The simplification of 'rebelling' to 'fighting against the government' is a highly effective strategy that maintains the original meaning while using more accessible vocabulary. Furthermore, the keyword 'tributes' was correctly identified and defined within the text ('which are the people selected to fight in the games'), seamlessly integrating the definition for the reader. The resulting text is clear, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the B1 level.",
