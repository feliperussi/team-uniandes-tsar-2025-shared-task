        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. The simplification was too aggressive. While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, the extensive use of A1/A2 vocabulary (e.g., 'country' for 'nation', 'TV' for 'television') and simple sentence structures has lowered the overall complexity too much. To reach the B1 target, consider reintroducing slightly more complex vocabulary or varying the sentence structure. For example, instead of combining the last two ideas with a simple 'and', they could be split into two sentences to improve flow and pacing. The definition of the keyword 'tributes' was handled well, but the overall text needs to be elevated slightly to meet the B1 standard."

        "feedback_text": "Excellent work. This submission is a clear PASS and serves as a model for B1 simplification. It successfully passed all priority checks: Factual Integrity, Meaning Preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.87, BERTScore: 0.98), and CEFR Compliance (B1). The simplification of 'rebelling' to 'fighting against the government' is a highly effective strategy that maintains the original meaning while using more accessible vocabulary. Furthermore, the keyword 'tributes' was correctly identified and defined within the text ('which are the people selected to fight in the games'), seamlessly integrating the definition for the reader. The resulting text is clear, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the B1 level."
