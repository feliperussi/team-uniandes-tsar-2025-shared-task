    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6209 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The core message of struggle and endurance has been diluted.\n\n- The original text's concept of being 'overcome with loneliness and despair' is a single, powerful state of being. Your version, 'he felt completely alone. He thought there was no hope,' splits this into two weaker ideas, losing the original intensity.\n- The original word 'endure' implies a difficult struggle. Your replacement 'lived through' is too neutral and fails to convey this meaning.\n- The phrase 'finds comfort' suggests an active search for solace. Your version 'made him feel better' is passive and less meaningful.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the original text's core concepts. The idea of 'despair' must be communicated more directly. The sense of 'endurance' against hardship is critical and must be present in the final text.",
