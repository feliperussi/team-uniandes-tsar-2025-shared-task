The text fails to preserve the core message of the original.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The simplification has removed the essential concepts of struggle and endurance. The original's 'endure violent storms' and 'live through hunger' convey a difficult fight for survival. Your version, 'There were bad storms' and 'They were very hungry', is a simple list of facts that loses this core meaning.\n- Secondary Deviation: The emotional intensity is lost. The original states Pi was 'overcome with loneliness and despair'. Your version, 'he felt very sad and alone', is a drastic reduction in meaning and fails to communicate the severity of his feelings.\n- Structural Issue: While short sentences are required for A2, the text is excessively fragmented. This contributes to the loss of meaning by breaking down complex ideas into overly simple, disconnected statements.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to show that the hunger and storms were difficult things they had to live through. Use slightly stronger A2 vocabulary to describe Pi's feelings, for example, 'he felt terrible and alone'. Combine some of the shortest sentences using 'and' to improve the narrative flow.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The simplification of strong, evocative concepts led to this failure. The original text's emphasis on suffering and endurance was lost.\n- The phrase 'They had many difficult problems' is a weak replacement for the original's 'They live through hunger, illness and exhaustion.' The concept of 'exhaustion' is completely missing.\n- The original states Pi was 'overcome with loneliness and despair'. Your version, 'he felt very sad and alone', does not capture the intensity of 'despair'. This is a significant change in meaning.\n- While the BERTScore is acceptable, it only shows that similar words were used. The MeaningBERT score shows that the meaning of those words in context was not preserved.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to show the severity of the situation. Instead of 'had many difficult problems', state the specific problems mentioned in the original: hunger, sickness, and being very tired. Find a stronger A2 way to express 'despair' than just 'sad'.",
