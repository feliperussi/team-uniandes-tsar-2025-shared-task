Genes are parts inside our body that help decide how we look and grow.  \nDNA is a long code inside our body.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6588 is well below the required minimum of approximately 0.75, indicating substantial loss of the original core meaning related to the genetics influence on language development. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8898 is below the 0.90 threshold, showing the text has lost key factual terminology and phrasing such as 'a gene mutation' and 'how our brains control our mouths and face'. Vocabulary issues: words like 'gene' and 'means' are B2 level but are pivotal terms here; the text tries to simplify but sometimes alters meaning (e.g., defining genetics as 'the study of how living things get their body parts from their parents' loses the original emphasis on language and brain development). The original's emphasis on 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago' is weakened by splitting sentences and oversimplifying the scientific context. Moreover, the use of complex structures such as 'might be found in our DNA' is simplified correctly, but the overall explanatory power is reduced, leading to meaning loss. Suggestion: Restore key factual phrases 'gene mutation', 'brain and language development', and 'control our mouths and face'. Keep essential scientific terms even if complex, but provide simpler supporting explanations. Increase vocabulary accuracy by keeping 'gene' and 'mutation' correct without oversimplifying their definitions improperly. Improve sentence coherence by combining related ideas to reflect original meaning faithfully.",
