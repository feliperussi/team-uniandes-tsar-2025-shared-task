This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text describes formal 'accusations' of 'unethical acts' and a 'consumer backlash'. Your version reduces this to 'people were angry' and 'bad things'. This oversimplification loses the meaning of public criticism and wrongdoing.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore of 0.8977 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing specific terms like 'supermarket chains' and 'pact' with generic phrases, which reduces fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary: The word 'used' is classified as B1. While common, it should be noted.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the lost meaning. Do not just simplify words; simplify the concepts while retaining their intent. Instead of 'people were angry', state 'Many people said the supermarkets did wrong things'. Instead of 'made a promise', use 'made an important agreement' to better reflect the original's meaning of a 'pact'."

The core meaning of serious wrongdoing and organized public opposition was lost through oversimplification.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text describes 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash'. Your translation to 'bad things' and 'customers were angry' is a severe dilution of meaning. It changes the tone from one of serious accusation to simple complaint, which is a critical failure in preserving the message.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because key phrases that carry specific meaning were replaced with generic terms, failing to maintain lexical fidelity to the source.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'They did not pay enough money to the companies that sell them food' uses a relative clause ('that sell them food'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase 'bad things' to 'things that were not right or fair'. Rephrase 'customers were angry' to 'many customers complained strongly'. Break the sentence containing the B1 relative clause into two A2 sentences.

Your output simplifies these to 'wrong things' and 'customers complained'. This simplification is excessive and loses the essential meaning of moral wrongdoing and strong public anger.\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of omitting key lexical items from the original, such as 'unethical', 'backlash', and 'pact'.

Rephrase 'customers complained' to 'customers were very angry about the plastic'.\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 verb 'used'.

This loses the specific meaning of actions that are morally wrong in a business context. The original's 'consumer backlash' is a strong term for public opposition. Your version, 'customers were very angry', is too general and loses the sense of a public reaction. The B1 vocabulary word 'waste' was used without being defined or simplified. For A2, this term must be explained, for example, as 'plastic that is thrown away'. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Replace 'did many bad things' with a phrase like 'did things that were not fair'. Explain the concept of 'waste' using simple A2 words.

This oversimplification removes the critical concepts of formal accusation and public pressure, fundamentally altering the meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low because key lexical items were replaced with overly generic terms.

This loss of specific vocabulary reduces fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary: The word 'fair' is not an adequate A2-level replacement for 'unethical acts'. The meaning is not equivalent.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning more accurately. Restore the concept of official complaints and formal agreements.

This simplification loses important lexical detail from the source text.\n\n- Inaccurate Simplification: The phrase 'plastic that people throw away' is used twice. The correct A2 term is 'plastic waste'. Your simplification is awkward and less accurate.\n\n- Definition Strategy Flaw: You defined 'pact' as 'a strong agreement'. The word 'agreement' is a B1 level noun. You must define keywords using only A1/A2 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original text's core concepts.

This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not permitted at the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of 'unethical acts' using simple A2 terms like 'doing bad things'. Restore the meaning of 'backlash' with a phrase like 'customers were very angry'. Remove the B1 relative clause by splitting the sentence into two. Example: 'Supermarkets buy food from other companies. They did not pay these companies enough money.'"

This is a direct result of replacing key terms like 'suppliers', 'consumer backlash', and 'pact' with overly simplistic phrases. This has resulted in a loss of important factual detail.\n\n- Structural Weakness: The sentence 'Packaging is the plastic or paper around food' is a good definition, but it is inserted abruptly and breaks the narrative flow. Definitions must be integrated smoothly into the text.\n\n- Grammatical Complexity: The text uses a relative clause ('companies that sell them food') and a that-clause ('said that big supermarkets...'). While sometimes acceptable at A2, their use here contributes to a text that struggles to maintain A2 simplicity while also failing to preserve B1-level meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the opening to reflect a more serious problem, for example: 'Big supermarkets have been in trouble for doing bad things.' Reintroduce the concept of 'suppliers' and define it simply.

Use stronger A2 language to describe the problem, for example, 'People were very angry'.\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'agreement' with an A2 alternative like 'promise' or 'plan'.\n- Suggestion: Split the complex sentences. Rewrite '...bad things that were not fair' as '...many bad things. These things were not fair.' Rewrite 'Suppliers are companies that sell food...' as 'Suppliers are companies. They sell food...'"

Your version weakens this to 'many people say' and 'customers are very angry'.

The meaning is not just about anger; it is about public accusation.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8926 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing key lexical items. The term 'unethical acts' was replaced with the overly simplistic 'things that are not right', losing significant semantic weight.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The definition 'A pact is a serious promise to do something together' is an acceptable simplification. However, the definition for 'packaging' is placed awkwardly in the middle of the text, disrupting the flow.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to convey the concept of public accusation. Change 'many people say that big supermarkets do things that are not right' to 'Many people accuse big supermarkets of doing bad things'.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6676 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8947 is also below the required 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT): The score is too low because the simplification has removed the original text's intensity. The concept of 'consumer backlash' and 'accusations' is much stronger than 'people are very angry'. The formal agreement of a 'pact' is more significant than a 'serious promise'. The core meaning of public pressure and formal response has been diluted.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because key factual words from the original were completely removed instead of being simplified. Terms like 'suppliers', 'consumer backlash', and 'pact' are central to the original's message and their absence damages the text's fidelity.\n\n- Tense Error: The sentence 'For the last ten years, people are very angry' uses the present simple tense. The action started in the past and continues. The correct A2 structure is the present perfect: 'For the last ten years, people have been very angry'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The text must convey the idea of public criticism and a formal agreement using A2 vocabulary. Rephrase 'people are very angry' to better reflect 'backlash'. Rephrase 'made a serious promise' to better reflect 'pact'. Correct the verb tense in the first sentence."

The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8903, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Primary Failure: The core meaning was lost during simplification. The original text's concept of 'unethical acts' was reduced to 'bad things'. This is too vague and loses the meaning of formal, moral wrongdoing.\n- Secondary Failure: The phrase 'consumer backlash' implies strong, collective action. Your replacement, 'Many customers complained', is weaker and does not carry the same semantic weight.\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases from the original text like 'unethical acts', 'consumer backlash', and 'signed up to a pact' were completely removed, causing the low BERTScore. While simplification is necessary, complete removal of core concepts is unacceptable.\n- Positive Note: The sentence structure is correctly simplified for A2, and the definitions for 'suppliers' and 'packaging' are clear. However, correct structure cannot save a text that has failed to preserve the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Replace 'did bad things' with a more precise A2 phrase like 'were not fair' or 'broke important rules'.

The BERTScore of 0.8864 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text conveys a strong sense of conflict and wrongdoing using phrases like 'come under fire', 'unethical acts', and 'consumer backlash'. Your version weakens this to 'criticized', 'things that were not right or fair', and 'customers complained'. This simplification fundamentally changes the tone and dilutes the core message of serious public anger and corporate misbehavior.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low because key terms were oversimplified, losing necessary detail. 'Suppliers' became 'companies that give them food'. 'Signed up to a pact' became 'made a promise'. While simplification is required, this level of substitution resulted in a text that is lexically too distant from the source.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to better reflect the intensity of the original message while using A2 vocabulary. Restore the concept of wrongdoing more directly. For example, replace 'things that were not right or fair' with 'they did bad things'. Replace 'customers complained' with 'customers were very angry'."

The primary reason for failure is the inability to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original text, as evidenced by the metrics.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6674 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text's concepts of 'accusations', 'unethical acts', and 'consumer backlash' were replaced with the much weaker 'people were angry', 'wrong things', and 'customers complained'. This loses the serious, confrontational tone of the source material.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8861 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing key factual phrases. 'Major supermarket chains' became 'big supermarkets'. 'Come under fire' became 'people were angry'. 'Signed up to a pact' became 'made a special agreement'. This level of simplification sacrifices too much lexical detail.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 noun 'agreement'. This is non-compliant with the A2 standard. The word 'promise' was used correctly in the next sentence and should have been used here instead.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification is too aggressive. You must rephrase to restore the meaning of formal criticism and public pressure. Replace the B1 word 'agreement' with an A2-level word like 'promise'. The text must more closely reflect the key terms of the original to meet fidelity standards."
