    "text_translated": "Packaging is the plastic or paper around food. For the last ten years, big supermarkets had many problems. People complained that the supermarkets did bad things. They threw away a lot of food. Suppliers are companies that sell food to supermarkets. The supermarkets did not pay their suppliers enough money. There was also too much plastic in their packaging. This was bad for our environment. Customers complained a lot about the plastic rubbish. So, some big UK supermarkets made an agreement. They promised to change their packaging and use less plastic.",
