The submission fails on two critical metrics, indicating a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.693 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text directly links Auggie's appearance to an 'agonising experience'. Your version, 'He felt very nervous and scared. Because he looks different, the day was bad,' disconnects the cause from the effect and reduces the intensity of the experience to 'bad', which is a substantial loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.872 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of oversimplification. Key phrases like 'intense ups and downs' and 'agonising experience' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same weight, causing a loss of lexical fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Content Dilution: While the vocabulary and sentence structure are A2 compliant, the simplification was too aggressive. The emotional weight of Auggie's journey is lost. The original's 'intense ups and downs' is a powerful concept that is not captured by stating he had 'happy moments' and 'sad moments' separately.\n\n- Suggestion: Revise to restore meaning. The text must show that his appearance is the direct cause of his very difficult first day. Rephrase to better capture the original's intensity. For example, instead of 'the day was bad', use 'the day was very, very hard for him'. Instead of separating happy and sad moments, combine them to show contrast, such as 'The school year had many very good times and many very bad times'.",

This indicates the core message of the original text has been lost. The BERTScore of 0.8746 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a failure to retain key phrasing.\n\nThe primary error is the misinterpretation of the final event. The original states a 'traumatic event... changes things completely,' implying a resolution to the 'ups and downs'. Your version, 'A very scary event at camp hurt him,' frames the event as purely negative and loses the crucial outcome of change.\n\nThe word 'Fortunately' was removed. This word is critical as it signals a positive turn in the story when Auggie makes friends. Its absence flattens the narrative.\n\nThe phrase 'intense ups and downs' was simplified into two separate, less effective sentences: 'The school year had many very good times. It also had many very bad times.' This loses the sense of a continuous, difficult struggle.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to capture the idea that the event caused a major change, not just that it was a negative experience. Restore the positive shift in tone when friends are made. Combine the sentences about good and bad times to better reflect the concept of 'ups and downs'.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that is factually similar but emotionally and thematically hollow.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8826 is below the 0.90 minimum. This confirms that too many key descriptive words from the original text were removed or replaced, weakening the output.\n- Loss of Intensity: The original text's strong emotional language was excessively diluted. 'Agonising experience' was reduced to 'very hard for him,' which does not convey the same level of suffering.\n- Tonal Mismatch: The phrase 'intense ups and downs' became 'many good and bad times,' which completely loses the sense of emotional extremity central to the original passage.\n- Understated Climax: The 'unexpected and traumatic event' was simplified to 'a scary event.' This fails to capture the severity and psychological impact implied by the word 'traumatic.'\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the emotional weight of the original. Use stronger A2-level adjectives. Replace 'very hard' with 'terrible'. Rephrase 'a scary event' to better reflect 'traumatic,' for example, 'a very bad and sad thing happened at camp.'
