    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8795 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text. While the simplification is appropriate for A2, it is too aggressive and sacrifices lexical fidelity.\n- The phrase 'agonising experience' was replaced with 'very scary', losing the original's intensity.\n- The phrase 'intense ups and downs' was replaced with 'happy and sad moments', which changes the meaning and removes key vocabulary.\n- The phrase 'unexpected and traumatic event' was replaced with 'a very scary and sad event', a significant oversimplification.\nSuggestion: Restore key vocabulary from the original text while keeping sentence structures simple. The goal is to simplify grammar, not eliminate all original descriptive words. For example, 'The school year had many ups and downs' is still A2-level but has higher fidelity to the original than 'The school year had many happy and sad moments'.",
