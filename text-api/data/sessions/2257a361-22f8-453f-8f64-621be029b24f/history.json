While the simplification of complex concepts like 'collapse' to 'fall down' and 'resistant to movement' to 'does not move so much' is excellent, it does not compensate for the vocabulary error. The text is not at a pure A2 level."

Sentence structure is simple and declarative, ideal for the A2 level. The keyword 'Earthquake' is correctly defined at the beginning for clarity. No errors found."
