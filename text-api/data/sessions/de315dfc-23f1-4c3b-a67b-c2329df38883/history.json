The core meaning and specific context of the original text have been diluted.\n- The term 'tributes' in the original text implies a specific, high-stakes, and often sacrificial role in a deadly competition. Your explanation 'Every year, the government chooses young people. These young people must fight in a bad game. They are called 'players'' is too generic and loses the grim, specific connotation of 'tributes'. The original's meaning of forced participation in a deadly ritual is not fully conveyed.\n- The original's 'heroine' implies a central female protagonist with heroic qualities. Your simplification to 'brave girl' loses the 'protagonist' aspect, reducing the specific role of the character.\n- 'mining accident' was simplified to 'work accident'. While 'work accident' is A2, 'mining' provides crucial context about the setting and the family's hardship, which is lost.\n- The phrase 'Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship' implies an unexpected or developing situation. Your version 'Katniss and Peeta have a relationship. Their feelings are not simple' accurately simplifies 'complicated' but loses the nuance of 'finds herself in', which suggests a less active or controlled development of the relationship.\nSuggestion: Rephrase the explanation of 'tributes' to better convey the specific, deadly nature of their role without using B1 vocabulary. Ensure the explanation of 'game' is more impactful. Consider how to retain the 'protagonist' aspect of 'heroine' at an A2 level. Restore the specificity of 'mining accident' if possible with A2 words, or acknowledge the loss of detail.",

The simplified text loses important nuances and the overall narrative flow of the original. The original text describes Katniss as the 'heroine' and highlights her 'skilful' use of a bow and arrow. Your version simplifies this to 'main girl' and 'uses arrows very well', which diminishes her character's importance and specific abilities. The original states Katniss 'volunteers' to go instead of Prim, conveying her agency and courage. Your version uses a direct quote, 'Katniss says, \"I will go instead of Prim.\"', which is a less active and less impactful expression of her decision. The original phrase 'Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship' implies her experience and perspective. Your version, 'Katniss and Peeta have a relationship. It becomes complicated.', is more detached and less personal. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain the original's emphasis on character traits and motivations, even with simpler vocabulary. For example, ensure the actions clearly show her heroism and skill. Use active verbs that convey agency.",
