    "grade": 3,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7322 is below the required 0.75. The core meaning and nuance of the original text were not fully preserved. The phrase 'Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with him' was simplified to 'Katniss has a relationship with Peeta. This relationship is not simple.' This change loses the subtle meaning of 'soon finds herself', which implies a developing or perhaps unexpected nature of the relationship. The output presents it as a static fact, thereby diminishing the original's narrative progression and emotional implication. The fragmentation of the original's narrative flow through excessive sentence splitting, while aiming for A2 simplicity, subtly diminished the overall meaning coherence and progression as captured by the MeaningBERT metric.",
