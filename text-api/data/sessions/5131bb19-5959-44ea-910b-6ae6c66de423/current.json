    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6348 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The simplification has altered key aspects of the meaning. Specific deviations include: 1. The original text states 'The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them.' Your version, 'We can stop bridges from falling down. We must plan for this,' weakens the definitive nature of 'the best way' and replaces the precise term 'bridge failures' with a more general phrase. 2. The original emphasizes 'reduce these terrible accidents.' Your version states 'help to stop terrible accidents.' 'Reduce' implies lessening the frequency or severity, which is more accurate for preventative measures, whereas 'stop' implies complete prevention, which is a stronger and potentially inaccurate claim. 3. The original's phrasing 'it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down' and 'it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse' clearly attributes the cause. Your fragmented sentences, while simple, lose some of this direct causal emphasis. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the original's emphasis on 'the best way' and 'reduce accidents'. Ensure that the specific causes of collapse (velocity of impact, large mass) are clearly and directly linked to the outcome.",
