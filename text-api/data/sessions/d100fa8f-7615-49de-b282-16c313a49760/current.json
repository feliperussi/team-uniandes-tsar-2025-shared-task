    "text_translated": "Around the 18th and 19th centuries two main theories about dreams became popular.  \n\nThe first theory says that the images we see in dreams represent hidden thoughts in our mind. This theory was supported by Freud, a famous psychologist who studied the mind. He believed that understanding dreams can reveal hidden feelings and the problems they cause.  \n\nThe opposite theory, however, claimed that dreams are just a collection of different activity in the brain while it organizes memories and events from the day.  \n\nWhen we wake up, we try to make sense of these different images and feelings by turning them into a simple story.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and accurately represents the two competing theories from the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.94) confirm that the core message and key details have been successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The submission shows strong strategic choices. Breaking the text into clear paragraphs, one for each theory, significantly improves structure and readability. The handling of the keyword 'Freud' is exemplary; providing the context 'a famous psychologist who studied the mind' is a perfect way to define the term for a B1 audience. Vocabulary substitutions like 'random activity' to 'different activity' are appropriate for the target level. Overall, this is a high-quality and well-executed simplification.",
