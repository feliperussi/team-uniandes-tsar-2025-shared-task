However, it failed the CEFR compliance check, as the classifier result was 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The B2 classification is likely due to two factors. First, the use of B2-level vocabulary such as 'psychologist' and 'random'. Second, the sentence 'It was supported by Freud, a psychologist who studied the mind and believed that understanding dreams can reveal hidden feelings and the problems they cause' is structurally too complex for a B1 level, containing multiple clauses. Suggestion: To correct this, split the complex sentence into two or three shorter sentences. For example: 'This theory was supported by Freud. He was a psychologist who studied the mind. He believed that understanding dreams can reveal hidden feelings and the problems they cause.'",

Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and accurately represents the two competing theories from the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.94) confirm that the core message and key details have been successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The submission shows strong strategic choices. Breaking the text into clear paragraphs, one for each theory, significantly improves structure and readability. The handling of the keyword 'Freud' is exemplary; providing the context 'a famous psychologist who studied the mind' is a perfect way to define the term for a B1 audience. Vocabulary substitutions like 'random activity' to 'different activity' are appropriate for the target level. Overall, this is a high-quality and well-executed simplification.",
