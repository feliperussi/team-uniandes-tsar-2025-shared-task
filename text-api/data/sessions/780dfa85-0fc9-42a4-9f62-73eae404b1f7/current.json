However, when this becomes a normal way to give **feedback**, employees might start to think that the positive comments are just a way to hide the bad news, so the positive **feedback** loses its value. Instead, positive **feedback** should not just be used to make negative comments softer, but it should be given to support and encourage good work.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - PASS.\nThe output accurately reflects all factual information from the original text. No discrepancies were found in numbers, names, dates, locations, key actions, or relationships.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - PASS.\nThe MeaningBERT score of 0.7795 is above the 0.75 threshold, indicating strong preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9106 is above the 0.90 threshold, showing excellent retention of key words and factual phrasing.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - PASS.\nThe CEFR classifier result is exactly 'B1', confirming the text is appropriately leveled for the target audience.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis - PASS.\nStructure and Flow: The text maintains a clear and logical flow, mirroring the original's three-sentence structure. B1 connectors such as 'However' and 'Instead' are used effectively to link ideas, contributing to good coherence. Sentence structures are varied and appropriate for the B1 level.\nVocabulary Strategy: The keyword 'feedback' was correctly defined and integrated into the first sentence: 'feedback (which means comments and advice about someone's work)'. Vocabulary candidates for replacement were handled skillfully. For example, 'sandwiching negative feedback' was simplified to 'putting negative comments between two positive ones', and 'perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value' was expertly simplified to 'think that the positive comments are just a way to hide the bad news, so the positive feedback loses its value'. These simplifications maintain the original meaning while making the language more accessible. The word 'means' used in the definition is acceptable as it serves an explanatory function.\n\nOverall, this is an exemplary simplification that meets all requirements with high quality. The writer demonstrated a strong understanding of B1 CEFR principles and effective simplification strategies.",
