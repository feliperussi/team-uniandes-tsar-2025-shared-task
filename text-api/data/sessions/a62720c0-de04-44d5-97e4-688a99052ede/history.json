The sentence 'Consumerism is when people buy many things they do not need' uses a defining 'when-clause' and an implied relative clause ('things [that] they do not need'). This complex structure is characteristic of the B1 level, not A2.\n\n- Structural Defect: The text is excessively fragmented into short, single-sentence paragraphs. This creates a disjointed and unnatural reading experience that is not appropriate for a coherent A2 text.\n\n- Suggestion: Redefine 'consumerism' using two simple A2 sentences. Example: 'Consumerism means people buy many things. They do not need these things.'\n\n- Suggestion: Combine related short sentences to create better flow. Example: 'The idea began in Canada in the early 1990s and later moved to the US.'\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning of protest.

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\n- Primary Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because key concepts were oversimplified, losing lexical precision. For example, 'rejection of the overspending and overconsumption' was reduced to 'stop spending too much money'.\n\n- Secondary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, which is an automatic failure. This is caused by using vocabulary above the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is B2 level. This is unacceptable. The word 'spending' is B1 level. This is also unacceptable.\n\n- Structural Defect: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. This is characteristic of A1, not the slightly more complex sentence structure expected at A2.\n\nSuggestion: Replace the B1 and B2 vocabulary immediately. The word 'means' must be rephrased to 'is when...'. The word 'spending' must be replaced with 'using money'. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to create a more natural text flow. For example, combine 'It started in Canada in the early 1990s.' and 'Later it moved to the United States.' into a single sentence.",
