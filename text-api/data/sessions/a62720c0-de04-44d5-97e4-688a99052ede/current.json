    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8741 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text. The text also fails on CEFR compliance.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because key concepts like 'rejection of overspending' and 'organise the exchange' were oversimplified, losing important lexical detail.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 classification was caused by using words above the A2 level. The word 'means' is B2 level. The word 'protest' is B1 level. These are unacceptable.\n\nSuggestion: Replace the B1/B2 vocabulary immediately. 'Consumerism means...' must be rephrased to 'Consumerism is when...'. '...people protest' must be rephrased to '...people show they are not happy'. To fix the BERTScore, re-introduce more specific A2-level words from the original text where possible.",
