Because of this, the number of people grew fast. Many children grew up and had their own children. So, the number of people grew even more.' This loses the explicit link that 'large families' (a result of fewer deaths) were the ones producing 'even more children', weakening the continuous cycle of growth. - The key phrase 'These large families' which connects the cause (fewer deaths) to the effect (more children being born) is omitted, leading to a less cohesive explanation of the population growth mechanism.

The original text focuses on the consequence of contraception's availability: the decline in birth rate.

Your version separates this into 'In the 1960s, it became easier to get. So, the average number of babies for each woman went down.' While the 'So' implies causality, the original's structure is more emphatic about the direct impact. Suggestion: Remove the explanatory sentence 'Contraception helps women to not have babies.'
