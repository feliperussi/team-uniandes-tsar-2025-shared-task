    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about how genes change our brain and language. Did some genes change and help us to speak? Scientists found a gene that changed a long time ago. This happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This changed gene seems to be connected with speaking. It is also connected with how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a gene that is almost the same, but their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. DNA is the material in our body that has all our genes. One day, we might find the answers in our DNA.",
