Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a gene that changed a long time ago. This happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This changed gene seems to be connected with speaking. It is also connected with how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a gene that is almost the same, but their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

The goal is to simplify to A2, not to replace one B1 word with another. The term 'DNA' is not A2 level and, unlike 'gene', it was not defined. All non-A2 keywords must be explained in simple terms. The sentence structure is appropriately simple, but the vocabulary violations are critical failures."

Necessary complex terms like 'gene' and 'DNA' are correctly identified and defined in simple terms, which is excellent practice. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are needed."
