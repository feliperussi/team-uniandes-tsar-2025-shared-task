This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The output also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8769, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's central argument is that the 'sandwich' method causes positive feedback to be devalued and diminished. Your version states the feedback is 'not important anymore', which is a vague simplification that loses the specific concept of its value being actively reduced by the manager's routine.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key concepts like 'sugarcoating', 'cushion the negative', and 'reinforce good performance' were replaced with overly general phrases. This lexical simplification is the direct cause of the low BERTScore.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. The repeated use of the B1-level keyword 'feedback' is a primary cause. The opening sentence, 'Feedback is when you tell someone...', uses a defining relative clause ('...is when...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 keyword 'feedback' is used six times. This is unacceptable. A keyword must be defined in simple terms and then referred to with A2-level phrasing.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the specific meaning of positive feedback losing its value. The B1 word 'feedback' must be replaced with an A2 phrase like 'talking about work' after the initial definition. Eliminate the 'X is when...' sentence structure. Start with a simple sentence like, 'Managers talk to workers about their work.'",
