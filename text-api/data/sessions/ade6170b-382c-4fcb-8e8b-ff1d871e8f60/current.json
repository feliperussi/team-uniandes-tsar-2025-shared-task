    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5641 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8732, below the required 0.90. The primary issue is oversimplification leading to a loss of meaning. The original text explains that positive feedback's value is 'diminished' because it is perceived as 'sugarcoating'. Your version, 'the good words are not real', loses this specific meaning. The concept of using feedback to 'reinforce and encourage' is also lost in the simpler 'support good work'. The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key conceptual words like 'routine', 'perceive', 'sugarcoating', 'diminishing', 'cushion', and 'reinforce' without adequate A2-level replacement. Suggestion: Re-write the text. You must find simple A2 ways to explain the concept of 'sugarcoating', for example, 'using nice words to hide the bad information'. You must also better explain the idea of 'reinforcing' good work, for example, 'use good words to show workers what they did well so they do it again'.",
