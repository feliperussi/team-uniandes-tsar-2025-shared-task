His journey started at a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and finished at the river's mouth in Brazil. The walk, which was 6,000 kilometres long, took him two years and four months. The Amazon rainforest is home to poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so Ed was in danger all the time. However, he was lucky and survived with nothing worse than a few thousand bites from mosquitoes and ants.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target level. While the simplification successfully preserved all facts and meaning, earning high scores on the MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics, it was too aggressive in its simplification. The primary reason for the A2 classification is likely the decision to split the original complex sentence about the journey's details into two very simple sentences. Additionally, replacing the phrase 'constant danger' with 'in danger all the time' further reduced the linguistic complexity. To elevate the text to B1, consider recombining the journey details into a single, more complex sentence using a relative clause, for example: 'His 6,000-kilometre walk, which took two years and four months, started in Peru and finished in Brazil.'",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.98) confirm that the core message and key details were fully preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The primary strength of this submission is its excellent structural simplification. The original sentence '...arrived... two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres' was skillfully rephrased into the more direct and linear B1 structure: 'His 6,000-kilometre walk started... and finished...'. This change significantly improves readability without losing any information. Additionally, replacing 'Luckily' with the B1 connector 'However, he was lucky' adds to the text's fluency and cohesion. The vocabulary strategy was also sound, correctly retaining appropriate B1-level words. No further improvements are needed.",
