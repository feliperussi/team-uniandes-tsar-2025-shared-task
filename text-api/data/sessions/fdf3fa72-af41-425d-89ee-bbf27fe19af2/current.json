    "text_translated": "Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person who has walked the entire length of the Amazon River. His 6,000-kilometre walk started at a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and finished two years and four months later at the river's mouth in Brazil. The Amazon rainforest is home to poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so Ed was in constant danger. However, he was lucky and survived with nothing worse than a few thousand bites from mosquitoes and ants.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.98) confirm that the core message and key details were fully preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The primary strength of this submission is its excellent structural simplification. The original sentence '...arrived... two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres' was skillfully rephrased into the more direct and linear B1 structure: 'His 6,000-kilometre walk started... and finished...'. This change significantly improves readability without losing any information. Additionally, replacing 'Luckily' with the B1 connector 'However, he was lucky' adds to the text's fluency and cohesion. The vocabulary strategy was also sound, correctly retaining appropriate B1-level words. No further improvements are needed.",
