The simplification efforts often reduced the text to an A2 level without maintaining or introducing B1-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, 'hugely successful' was simplified to 'very popular', and 'major Hollywood film' to 'big Hollywood film'. Both 'hugely successful' and 'major' are suitable B1 vocabulary and could have been retained. The original text already contained many B1-appropriate elements. To achieve B1, the text should retain B1 vocabulary where possible and use a wider range of B1 sentence structures, such as more varied conjunctions or slightly more complex clause structures, rather than simplifying existing B1 features to A2.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and the meaning and fidelity to the original text are excellent, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9376 and BERTScore of 0.9823. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer made subtle but effective changes. The first sentence was rephrased using a relative clause, 'which is a hugely successful book for teenagers and young adults,' which is a good B1 structure. The last two sentences of the original were effectively combined using the discourse marker 'Now,' and the conjunction 'because,' improving the flow and logical connection between ideas. The vocabulary remains appropriate for the B1 level. One area for improvement is the handling of 'Keywords for Definition.' While 'Hunger Games' was identified as a keyword, it was not defined within the text. For future tasks, consider if a brief, context-appropriate definition or explanation could be integrated for such keywords to further aid comprehension for the target audience.",
