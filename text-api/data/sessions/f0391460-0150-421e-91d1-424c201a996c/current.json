    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games, which is a hugely successful book for teenagers and young adults, was written by the American author Suzanne Collins. Since it was published in 2008, it has been translated into 26 different languages and has sold millions of copies around the world. It is also the first book for young readers to sell more than a million electronic copies. Now, The Hunger Games is also a major Hollywood film, and it is just as successful, because it made 152.5 million dollars in its opening weekend in North America alone.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the meaning and fidelity to the original text are excellent, as indicated by the MeaningBERT score of 0.9376 and BERTScore of 0.9823. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer made subtle but effective changes. The first sentence was rephrased using a relative clause, 'which is a hugely successful book for teenagers and young adults,' which is a good B1 structure. The last two sentences of the original were effectively combined using the discourse marker 'Now,' and the conjunction 'because,' improving the flow and logical connection between ideas. The vocabulary remains appropriate for the B1 level. One area for improvement is the handling of 'Keywords for Definition.' While 'Hunger Games' was identified as a keyword, it was not defined within the text. For future tasks, consider if a brief, context-appropriate definition or explanation could be integrated for such keywords to further aid comprehension for the target audience.",
