    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to hurt the people. This is because the people did not follow the rules. Every year, they pick one boy and one girl from each part of the country. The young people are between 12 and 18 years old. They must fight. Only one person can stay alive. People call these young people 'tributes'. A tribute is a person who has to fight in the games. All the people in the country must watch the games on TV.",

The C1 keyword 'tributes' is correctly introduced and then immediately defined using simple A2 language. Sentence structure is simple and clear. No errors.",
