The use of 'children' for people up to 18 years old is imprecise. The sentence 'The chosen teenagers are called 'tributes'' uses a passive voice structure ('are called'). While common, an active form like 'People call these young people 'tributes'' is simpler and adheres more strictly to A2 standards."

The C1 keyword 'tributes' is correctly introduced and then immediately defined using simple A2 language. Sentence structure is simple and clear. No errors."
