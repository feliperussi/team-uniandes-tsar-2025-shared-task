I talked to my boss and we agreed to reduce my working week to three days. This meant a big cut in my pay, because I am paid on a pro-rata basis, which means I get less money when I work fewer hours. However, I have noticed that my workload, meaning the amount of work I have to do, has not become smaller at all. Now, I am doing the work of five days in only three days, but I am getting paid much less for it!",
