The BERTScore of 0.8865 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing.\n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The writer's output introduces a definition of 'feedback' ('Feedback is when you tell someone what you think about their work.

This addition alters the scope and initial focus of the message.\n- The core message regarding the consequences of always pairing feedback ('the positives can become devalued and ignored') is simplified to 'the good feedback seems less important. People will not listen to it.' This simplification loses the specific nuance of 'devalued' and 'ignored' in a broader context.\n- Key phrases from the original, such as 'for its own sake' and 'resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism', are not adequately preserved. 'Resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism' is simplified to 'Don't give bad feedback at these times', which loses the specific meaning of 'constructive criticism' and the concept of 'temptation'.\n- Important vocabulary from the original, including 'devalued', 'ignored', 'constructive criticism', and 'temptation', is not retained or adequately simplified while preserving the full intended meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Remove any information not present in the original text, such as the definition of feedback.

The original text discusses the value of positive feedback and the temptation to offer constructive criticism, which are nuanced concepts. Your version simplifies 'feedback' to 'good things' and 'bad things', and 'constructive criticism' to 'how to make things better', which fundamentally alters the professional context and the psychological impact described in the original. The BERTScore of 0.8869 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key terms and factual phrasing. The term 'feedback' is central to the original text and its complete removal, replaced by generic 'good things' and 'bad things', is a major lexical deviation. The concept of 'devalued' is lost entirely. Specific deviations: - The core concept of 'feedback' as a professional communication tool is lost by replacing it with 'good things' and 'bad things'. This is an oversimplification that changes the meaning. - The idea of 'positives can become devalued and ignored' is not adequately conveyed. 'good words will not feel important. People will not listen to them' is a weaker, less precise statement. - The phrase 'for its own sake' is not accurately captured by 'because they are good'. - 'Resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism' is simplified to 'Do not say how to make things better', which loses the nuance of 'temptation' and the specific type of 'criticism'. Suggestion: Restore the core meaning by using appropriate A2 vocabulary for 'feedback' and 'criticism' if possible, or by defining them clearly. Ensure the concepts of 'value' and 'temptation' are conveyed, even if simplified. Rephrase to ensure the BERTScore is above 0.90 by retaining more lexical similarity where appropriate for A2.",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message. Specifically, the nuance of 'devalued' in the original text, which refers to a loss of inherent worth or significance, is not fully captured by the phrase 'loses its power' in your version, which primarily refers to effectiveness. While related, these concepts are distinct enough to cause a significant deviation in meaning as detected by the metric. The original's emphasis on the intrinsic worth of positive feedback is diminished. Suggestion: Rephrase the section about the impact of mixed feedback to more accurately reflect the concept of 'devaluation' in simple A2 terms, ensuring the intrinsic value of positive feedback is preserved.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.435 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and its nuances. The original text emphasizes that positive feedback can become 'devalued and ignored' if always paired with negative feedback, highlighting a loss of its inherent worth and impact. Your simplification 'the good feedback is not special. People will not listen to it.' loses the strength and specific implications of 'devalued' (loss of worth) and 'ignored' (active disregard). The overall message about the strategic effectiveness of feedback is weakened. The BERTScore of 0.8953 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Extensive rephrasing of core concepts such as 'positive feedback', 'negative feedback', 'devalued and ignored', 'for its own sake', and 'resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism' into simpler, but less precise, terms like 'good feedback', 'bad feedback', 'not special', 'will not listen to it', 'just because it is good', and 'do not give advice to make things better then' resulted in this lexical fidelity loss. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the strength and specific implications of terms like 'devalued' and 'ignored'. Ensure that key concepts are simplified without losing their precise meaning or the strategic emphasis of the original text. Aim for a higher lexical overlap with the original's core terms while maintaining A2 simplicity.",
