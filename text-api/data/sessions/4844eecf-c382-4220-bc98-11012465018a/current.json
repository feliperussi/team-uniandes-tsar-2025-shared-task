    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required standards for both meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5256 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8949 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Specific deviations include: The nuance of 'for its own sake' is not fully captured by 'only because it is good', which loses the intrinsic value aspect. The original's emphasis on 'devalued and ignored' is simplified, and while 'lose its value' and 'not pay attention to it' convey part of the meaning, the full impact is diminished. Key terms like 'positive feedback', 'negative feedback', 'devalued', 'ignored', 'for its own sake', and 'constructive criticism' were replaced with less precise A2 terms ('good feedback', 'bad feedback', 'lose its value', 'not pay attention to it', 'only because it is good', 'advice to fix problems'), leading to the low BERTScore. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the original's meaning regarding the intrinsic value of positive feedback and the specific impact of its devaluation. Ensure lexical choices are closer to the original while remaining A2 compliant to improve fidelity.",
