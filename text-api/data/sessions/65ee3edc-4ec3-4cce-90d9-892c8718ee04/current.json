    "text_translated": "In the last 10 years, people said bad things about many big supermarkets. For example, they wasted a lot of food. They also paid the companies that sell them food too little money. They created too much plastic waste with the materials used to wrap food. This was bad for our environment. But now, supermarkets are starting to pay attention. Customers are very unhappy about the large amount of plastic waste. Because of this, some of the biggest UK supermarkets made a promise. They plan to change how they wrap food and create less plastic waste.",
