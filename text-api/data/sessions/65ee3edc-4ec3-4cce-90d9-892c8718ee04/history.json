For example, they have wasted a lot of food and paid their suppliers too little money. They have also created too much plastic waste with their packaging, which has harmed our environment. But now, supermarkets and food shops are starting to pay attention. Customers are very unhappy about the huge amount of plastic waste from packaging. Because of this, some of the largest supermarkets in the UK have made a promise. They plan to change their packaging and reduce plastic waste.",

This violates the vocabulary rule. Several sentences exceed the 15-word limit, and the text relies too heavily on the present perfect tense, making it structurally complex for a B1 learner."
