The Cavendish banana is the one that replaced Big Mike.\n\nThe Gros Michel banana was very popular. It was easy to move, had thick skin, and was sweet. It was the main banana on almost all the big farms in Central America.\n\nA company called United Fruit grew these bananas. It was the main grower in South America at that time. It found a good, fast way to grow them. They grew huge numbers of bananas quickly and cheaply. They did not grow new plants from seeds. Instead, they cloned them by taking parts from old plants. They grew these new plants very close together in the fields.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6983 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text uses the superlative phrase 'the most efficient way possible' to describe the production method. Your version weakens this critical concept to 'a good, fast way'. This loses the essential meaning of maximization and optimization that defined the company's strategy.\n- Secondary Deviation: The original states the Gros Michel was the 'most lucrative product'. Your version, 'most important product for making money', is a reasonable simplification but contributes to the overall loss of semantic intensity detected by the metric.\n\nSuggestion: The text must accurately reflect the original's emphasis on peak performance. Rephrase 'a good, fast way to grow them' to 'the best and fastest way to grow them'. This change is required to meet the meaning preservation standard.",
