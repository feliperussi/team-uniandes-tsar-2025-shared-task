The core message of the original text has been altered. The primary error is in the sentence: 'Nobody knows if language was important for this.' The original text questions the 'connection' between early civilisation and language. This implies a relationship or a link. Your version changes this to a question of 'importance' or value, which is a different concept and a failure to preserve the original meaning. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are appropriate for A2, this does not compensate for the loss of meaning.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for the low score is the oversimplification of key concepts. The original text's mention of 'early human civilisation' is a central idea. Your replacement, 'things changed', is too vague and loses this essential meaning.\n- The original states humans became 'more complex'. Your version, 'started to think about more difficult things', is not an equivalent concept and alters the meaning.\n- The original asks if language caused brains to 'develop'. Your version, 'work in a better way', is an imprecise simplification that fails to capture the meaning of development and growth.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the lost meaning. The concept of 'civilisation' must be included in simple terms, for example, 'the start of how people lived together in groups'. The simplification of 'develop' must be more accurate; use a phrase like 'grow and change' instead of 'work in a better way'."

The MeaningBERT score of 0.77 and BERTScore of 0.94 confirm that meaning and key terms were successfully preserved. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly A2. B1-level words from the original, such as 'civilisation', 'connection', 'complex', and 'develop', were correctly identified and replaced with simpler A2 equivalents like 'lived together', 'link', 'not simple', and 'grow and change'.\n- Structural Simplification: The text exclusively uses short, simple sentences and basic A2 connectors ('but', 'and', 'or'). The structure is clear, direct, and perfectly aligned with the target proficiency level. No deviations were found."
