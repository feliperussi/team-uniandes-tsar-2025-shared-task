While the text maintains factual accuracy, it significantly dilutes the core meaning and nuance of the original text through oversimplification of key concepts and relationships. This results in a loss of the original's intended message regarding the dystopian setting and power dynamics. Specific examples of meaning loss include: 1. The phrase 'after the destruction of North America' is simplified to 'North America was gone', losing the active consequence of a destructive event. 2. 'governed by the wealthy Capitol' is reduced to 'A rich city rules these areas', diminishing the specific nature of governance and the Capitol's wealth. 3. 'holds absolute power over the nation' is weakened to 'has all control over Panem', losing the intensity of 'absolute power'. 4. 'Each district is responsible for producing different things' is simplified to 'Each area makes different things. They give these things', losing the sense of obligation and systemic responsibility. 5. 'rebelled against the Capitol' is softened to 'fought the Capitol', losing the specific political connotation of an uprising against authority. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain the stronger, more specific meanings of governance, power, responsibility, and rebellion, while still using A2 vocabulary and structures.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6697 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the core message. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8945 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation: The addition of the definition 'Coal is a black rock. People burn coal for heat.' introduces new information not present in the original text's core message, diluting the focus and contributing to the low MeaningBERT score. The original text focuses on the setting and political structure, not resource definitions.\n- Lexical Fidelity: The consistent replacement of original terms such as 'districts' with 'areas', 'nation' with 'Panem', 'responsible for producing' with 'must make', 'provides' with 'gives', and 'rebelled' with 'fought' directly contributed to the low BERTScore. The omission of 'for the country' after 'all the coal' also reduced lexical fidelity.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'coal' is classified as B1. Its presence in the text is a deviation from the A2 standard.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'Hunger' in the title 'The Hunger Games' is classified as B1. While part of a proper noun, the word itself exceeds the A2 vocabulary limit.\n- Redundancy: The sentences 'The country's name is Panem. Panem is a country.' contain redundant information.\n\nCorrective Path:\nRemove the unrequested definition of coal. Focus strictly on the information provided in the original text. Replace B1 vocabulary words like 'coal' with simpler A2 alternatives or rephrase sentences to avoid them entirely. For example, instead of 'coal', describe its function in A2 terms if essential, or simply state 'Area 12 gives a black rock for heat' if the specific word 'coal' is too complex. Rephrase the title if possible to avoid B1 words, or explicitly state that titles are exempt from simplification if that is the intent. Ensure all key terms and phrases from the original are preserved as closely as possible while adhering to A2 grammar and vocabulary. Eliminate redundant sentences to improve conciseness and clarity. For example, combine 'The country's name is Panem. Panem is a country.' into a single, clear A2 sentence.",
