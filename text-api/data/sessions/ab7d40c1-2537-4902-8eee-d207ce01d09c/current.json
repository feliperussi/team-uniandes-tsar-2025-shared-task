    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed with high fidelity and CEFR compliance. The text successfully simplifies the original content to an A2 level without sacrificing factual integrity or core meaning. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8038 exceeds the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.9156 surpasses the 0.90 requirement, demonstrating strong lexical and factual fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the output as A2. Vocabulary choices are consistently at or below the A2 level, with complex terms like 'coal' simplified to 'black rock' and 'rebelled against' to 'fought against' and 'wanted to stop the Capitol's rule'. Sentence structures are short and simple, adhering to A2 grammatical expectations. The addition of 'The Capitol is a city' serves as a helpful, simple clarification for a key term, which is appropriate for A2 comprehension.",
