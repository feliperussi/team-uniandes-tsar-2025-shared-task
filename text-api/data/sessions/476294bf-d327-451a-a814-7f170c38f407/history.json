No discrepancies were found.\n- Metric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.8251) and BERTScore (0.9051) are above the required thresholds of 0.75 and 0.90 respectively. The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly controlled. Key B1 terms 'district' and 'Capitol' were correctly identified and defined using simple A2 language within the text itself. The B1 noun 'coal' was retained as it is a specific, factual detail, which is an acceptable exception.\n- Structural Simplicity: Sentence structures are consistently simple and short. The use of the connector 'so' and a defining relative clause ('that rules the country') are appropriate for the A2 level. The text is well-organized with clear paragraph breaks.",

Suggestion: Replace 'destroyed' with a simpler A2 phrase, such as 'ended it' or 'broke it apart'. The noun 'coal' is also B1 level; while sometimes unavoidable for specific topics, a simpler alternative should always be sought.",

Your output changes this to 'black rocks for fire'. This is factually incorrect. 'Coal' is a specific resource; 'black rocks for fire' is a vague, inaccurate description. This is an instant failure.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7366 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of core meaning. The phrase 'the Capitol ended it' is a weak and vague replacement for 'were destroyed', failing to convey the severity of the action.\nSuggestion: Restore the word 'coal'. If simplification is necessary, define it separately. Example: 'This district provides coal. Coal is a black rock used for energy.'\nSuggestion: Replace 'ended it' with 'destroyed it'. This is an A2-level verb and accurately preserves the original meaning.",

The use of the connector 'so' is compliant.\n- Observation: The sentence \"The Capitol is the name of the rich city that rules the country\" uses a defining relative clause.
