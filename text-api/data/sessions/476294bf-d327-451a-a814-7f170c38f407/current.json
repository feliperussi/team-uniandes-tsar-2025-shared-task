    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: The output is factually identical to the original text. All key information has been preserved.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7966 and BERTScore of 0.9023 are above the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: B1-level keywords ('district', 'Capitol', 'coal') were correctly identified and defined using simple A2 vocabulary. This is exemplary adherence to the standard.\n- Sentence Structure: The text consistently uses short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level. The use of the connector 'so' is compliant.\n- Observation: The sentence \"The Capitol is the name of the rich city that rules the country\" uses a defining relative clause. While acceptable at the higher end of A2, the strictest application would require splitting this into two sentences: \"The Capitol is a rich city. It rules the country.\" This is a minor point and does not affect the PASS verdict.",
