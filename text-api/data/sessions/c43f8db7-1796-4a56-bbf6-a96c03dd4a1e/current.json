    "text_translated": "When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents do not support. Worried about the future, his parents decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. Some of the animals are sold to zoos in North America, and the family travels by ship to Canada, taking the remaining animals with them. During the crossing a terrible storm hits, the ship sinks, and tragically the family and the sailors drown. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orang\u2011utan and an enormous tiger. A hyena is a wild meat\u2011eating animal. A zebra is a striped African animal. An orang\u2011utan is a large orange\u2011haired ape. An enormous tiger is a huge striped cat.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the MeaningBERT (0.81) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy was executed very well; the definitions provided for 'hyena', 'zebra', 'orang-utan', and 'tiger' are clear and highly appropriate for the B1 level. The sentence structure was also improved by splitting longer, more complex sentences into shorter ones, which enhances readability. For future improvement, consider the C1-level verb 'drown'. While its meaning is clear from the context, a simpler alternative like 'died in the water' could have been used to more strictly adhere to B1 vocabulary.",
