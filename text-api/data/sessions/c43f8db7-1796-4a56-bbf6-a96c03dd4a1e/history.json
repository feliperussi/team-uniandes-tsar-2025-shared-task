        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6656 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a significant loss of the original text's core message and tone. This is likely caused by several changes: 1. Replacing 'a new government is elected' with 'a new rule in power' loses semantic precision. 2. Removing the word 'Tragically' from the sentence about the family drowning eliminates the emotional weight of the event. 3. Simplifying 'an enormous tiger' to 'a tiger' removes the crucial sense of scale and danger. To fix this, reintroduce the lost concepts. For example, use 'a new government came to power' and describe the tiger as 'huge' or 'enormous' to better preserve the original's meaning and impact.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the MeaningBERT (0.81) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy was executed very well; the definitions provided for 'hyena', 'zebra', 'orang-utan', and 'tiger' are clear and highly appropriate for the B1 level. The sentence structure was also improved by splitting longer, more complex sentences into shorter ones, which enhances readability. For future improvement, consider the C1-level verb 'drown'. While its meaning is clear from the context, a simpler alternative like 'died in the water' could have been used to more strictly adhere to B1 vocabulary.",
