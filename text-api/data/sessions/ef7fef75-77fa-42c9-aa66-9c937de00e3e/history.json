The original text strongly conveys the continuous historical practice of painting and writing on walls across different eras.

While individual sentences are simplified for A2, the overall fragmentation appears to have reduced the semantic coherence as detected by the MeaningBERT model. Suggestion: Rephrase 'always' to convey 'in many different times' or 'for a long time'. Consider how to subtly convey past habitual actions without using complex grammar.

This reduces the clarity of the historical timeline and scope. The original's first sentence sets a broad historical context, which is immediately followed by a definition of 'graffiti' in the output, shifting the initial focus.\n- Meaning Preservation: The phrase 'political messages' from the original is simplified to 'leaders'. While 'leaders' is an A2 word, it changes the meaning from the *type of message* (political content) to the *subject* (people who lead), which is a subtle but significant shift in meaning.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'magic' is classified as B1. For a strict A2 text, this word should be replaced with a simpler A2 equivalent, such as 'special tricks' or 'things that are not real'.",

Your version inserts a definition of graffiti ('Graffiti is writing or pictures on walls') which, while not incorrect, was not the core message of the corresponding original sentence and dilutes the overall narrative flow. 2. The original specifies 'archaeologists have found' in Pompeii, which is a precise detail about the discoverers. Your simplification to 'people found' loses this specific and important information. 3. The original's 'people in Africa and Europe used to paint pictures' emphasizes the activity. Your 'people lived in Africa and Europe. They painted animals and people in caves' slightly weakens the direct connection between the people and their painting activity in that context. These changes, while seemingly minor, cumulatively reduce the fidelity of the meaning to the original. Suggestion: Remove the explicit definition of graffiti.

The core message of the original text, which emphasizes the historical presence and widespread examples of graffiti, has been diluted. The inclusion of an explicit definition 'Graffiti is writing or pictures on walls' shifts the focus from the original's illustrative approach to a definitional one. While simplification is necessary for A2, adding a definition not present in the original text alters the primary intent. Additionally, the repeated use of 'very old times' and 'very old buildings' slightly diminishes the historical breadth conveyed by the original's 'throughout history,' 'prehistoric times,' and 'ancient sites'.",

The core message and nuances of the original text have been lost due to oversimplification and fragmentation. The text fails to convey the original's emphasis on historical continuity, the specific nature of discoveries, and the comprehensive variety of graffiti examples. Specific deviations include: The original's 'throughout history' and 'used to paint' convey ongoing historical activity, which is diminished by 'always painted' and the lack of 'used to'. The original's 'pictures of animals and people' is more specific than 'animals and people'. The original's 'Graffiti has been found on buildings at ancient sites' and 'archaeologists have found numerous examples' imply expert discovery and specific locations, which is lost in the vague 'People found graffiti in old places' and 'people found much graffiti'. The original's 'religious, political and romantic messages, and even some magic spells!' conveys a range of examples, which is lost by breaking these into separate, disconnected sentences like 'The graffiti had messages about gods. It had messages about leaders and rules. It had messages about love. It also had magic words.' The term 'magic words' is also less precise than 'magic spells'. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain the sense of historical continuity and the specific nature of the examples. Combine related ideas into slightly longer, but still A2-appropriate, sentences to preserve the original's flow and detail. Ensure that the agents of discovery (e.g., archaeologists) are implied or stated if possible within A2 limits.",

The original text strongly emphasizes the historical continuity and widespread nature of graffiti as a human activity throughout history. Your version begins with a definition, then presents historical facts as separate points, which dilutes the core message of graffiti being an inherent and continuous historical phenomenon. The original's opening sentence 'People have been painting and writing on walls throughout history' immediately establishes this core idea, which is not fully captured by your fragmented approach.\n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'used' is listed as B1 in the provided vocabulary candidates. While 'used to' is an A2 structure, the word 'used' itself is flagged. This must be simplified or rephrased to avoid any B1 vocabulary.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'magic' is listed as B1 in the provided vocabulary candidates. This must be simplified to an A2 equivalent, such as 'special words' or 'secret words'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to more directly convey the historical continuity of graffiti. For example, 'People have always painted and written on walls.' Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2. Replace 'used to paint' with 'painted' or 'always painted'. Replace 'magic spells' with 'special words for spells'.",
