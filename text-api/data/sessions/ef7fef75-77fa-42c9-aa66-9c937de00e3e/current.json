    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7099 is below the required 0.75. The original text strongly emphasizes the historical continuity and widespread nature of graffiti as a human activity throughout history. Your version begins with a definition, then presents historical facts as separate points, which dilutes the core message of graffiti being an inherent and continuous historical phenomenon. The original's opening sentence 'People have been painting and writing on walls throughout history' immediately establishes this core idea, which is not fully captured by your fragmented approach.\n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'used' is listed as B1 in the provided vocabulary candidates. While 'used to' is an A2 structure, the word 'used' itself is flagged. This must be simplified or rephrased to avoid any B1 vocabulary.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'magic' is listed as B1 in the provided vocabulary candidates. This must be simplified to an A2 equivalent, such as 'special words' or 'secret words'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to more directly convey the historical continuity of graffiti. For example, 'People have always painted and written on walls.' Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2. Replace 'used to paint' with 'painted' or 'always painted'. Replace 'magic spells' with 'special words for spells'.",
