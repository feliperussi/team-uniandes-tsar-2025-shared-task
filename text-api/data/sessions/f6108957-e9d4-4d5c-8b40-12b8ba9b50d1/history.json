The goal is to communicate using words the A2 learner already knows, not to teach new, complex vocabulary. The sentence structure is simple and appropriate, but the vocabulary violation is a critical and non-negotiable error."

The complex idea of 'prophecy' is explained using simple, understandable terms ('see the future'). Sentence structures are simple and declarative, adhering strictly to the A2 standard. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary."
