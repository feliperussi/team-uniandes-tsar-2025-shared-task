It does not mean your dream can see the future. And, of course, we probably forget all the times we dream about these things but they do not happen.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. It successfully simplifies the B2-level concept of 'coincidence' to the A2-friendly phrase 'by chance'. The complex idea of 'prophecy' is explained using simple, understandable terms ('see the future'). Sentence structures are simple and declarative, adhering strictly to the A2 standard. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary.",
