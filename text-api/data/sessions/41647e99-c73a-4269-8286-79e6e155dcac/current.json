    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Now NASA is looking for smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or more. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 of them. So far, NASA found about 8,000. So, they still need to find 17,000. These asteroids are a serious danger. For example, a small asteroid broke apart over a city in Russia in 2013. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a very big problem if they come near Earth.",
