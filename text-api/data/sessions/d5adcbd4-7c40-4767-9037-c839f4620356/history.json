Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5578 is well below the required 0.75. The original text specifically defines and discusses 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs) and NASA's actions regarding these specific objects. Your version generalizes to 'Asteroids are small rocks in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous,' losing the specific focus and definition of PHAs. The nuance of 'none of which are expected to be a threat' is also simplified, altering the original message's precision. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8921 is below the required 0.90. Key terms and phrases from the original text were not adequately preserved. For example, 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was completely omitted. 'Earth's orbit' was replaced with 'Earth's path'. 'Technology already available' was simplified to 'tools now'. 'Predictions about possible impact' became 'say if a rock will hit Earth'. 'Defence solutions' was reduced to 'two things'. This loss of specific vocabulary impacts the fidelity of the message. Suggestion: Reintroduce the specific term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and define it clearly, even if simplified. Ensure that the subsequent sentences refer back to these specific asteroids. Use more precise A2 vocabulary to maintain fidelity to the original concepts, such as 'Earth's orbit' instead of 'Earth's path' if 'orbit' is deemed A2.

The core message and important details from the original text have been lost or diluted. The text fails to accurately convey the full meaning of the original. The following specific deviations were identified: The original text specifically defines 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. Your version introduces a general definition of 'Asteroids' first and then refers to 'Hazardous Asteroids', omitting the crucial word 'Potentially'. This changes the specific focus of the original. The phrase 'With technology already available' from the original, which emphasizes NASA's current readiness, is completely absent in your version. This loses an important detail about the current state of capabilities. The original states 'two defence solutions could be launched'. Your version simplifies this to 'NASA has two ways to stop it'. While conveying the general idea, it loses the nuance of 'solutions' and the 'could be launched' aspect, which implies a specific, actionable plan. The original's definition of the asteroids is 'close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your version states 'come less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth's path'. While similar, 'Earth's orbit' is more precise than 'Earth's path' in this scientific context, and 'close enough to pass within' implies a specific proximity criterion, which is slightly softened by 'come less than'. Suggestion: Restore the specific term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' as the subject of the definition. Include the concept of 'technology already available' to convey current readiness.

The original text's core message is about 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and their specific definition. Your output introduces 'Asteroids' generally and then mentions 'dangerous rocks' without clearly establishing the specific category of asteroids the original text focuses on. This dilutes the primary subject and its defining characteristic. The BERTScore of 0.8967 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key lexical information. The specific term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was completely omitted. Phrases like 'Earth's orbit' were simplified to 'Earth', and 'defence solutions' to 'ways to keep Earth safe', which, while simpler, lose the precise terminology of the original. Suggestion: Reintroduce the concept of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' as the main subject. Clearly define them by their proximity to Earth's orbit as the original text does. Ensure key terms like 'Earth's orbit' and 'defence solutions' are retained or rephrased with equivalent A2-level precision to maintain fidelity.",

The BERTScore of 0.8992 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original.

This alters the meaning from active 'solutions' that are 'launched' to passive 'plans' that are 'sent out', losing the original's active intervention concept. The original defines 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' directly by their proximity to Earth's orbit. Your version introduces general asteroids first ('Asteroids are small rocks in space'), then names PHAs, and then describes their proximity, which weakens the direct definitional link present in the original. Lexical fidelity was also compromised. For example, 'expected to be a threat' was simplified to 'will be a problem', and 'Earth's orbit' was changed to 'Earth's path in space'. The phrase 'make predictions about possible impact' was significantly rephrased to 'say if a rock will hit Earth. They can also say when.' These changes contribute to the low BERTScore. Suggestion: Rephrase the ending to reflect 'defence solutions' that can be 'launched' rather than 'plans' that are 'sent out'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8965 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was largely preserved. The simplification of specific terminology reduced the lexical overlap too much. \n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The original phrase 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was not fully retained or clearly introduced as a specific term, impacting lexical fidelity. The output only states 'Some asteroids are called 'PHAs'' without defining the 'Potentially Hazardous' aspect in the initial introduction of the term.\n- The phrase 'Earth's orbit' was simplified to 'Earth's path'. While semantically similar, 'orbit' is a key term that should have been retained or explained more directly if simplified.\n- The specific term 'defence solutions' was replaced with 'two ways to protect Earth. They can send special things to space to stop it.' This is an oversimplification that loses the precise lexical detail of 'defence solutions'.\n\nSuggestion: Retain more of the original specific terminology. For example, introduce 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' more directly. Use 'Earth's orbit' or explain it simply rather than replacing it. Rephrase 'defence solutions' to maintain lexical fidelity while remaining A2 compliant, such as 'two ways to defend Earth' or 'two plans to stop them'.",
