Use A2 vocabulary to describe extreme sadness, fear, and pain. Do not replace strong emotional words with simple, neutral descriptors. The core concepts of 'agony', 'intensity', and 'trauma' must be present in the final text.",

This incorrectly frames the event's outcome as purely negative for Auggie, losing the original's crucial meaning that this event was the catalyst for change.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.9029 is acceptable and the CEFR A2 classification is correct, the loss of the core message is an instant failure.\n- The vocabulary and sentence structure are otherwise compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to restore the original meaning.
