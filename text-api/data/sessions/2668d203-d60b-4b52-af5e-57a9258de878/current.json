Scientists want to know if a change in these instructions gave us the ability to speak. Researchers have found a change in these instructions that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected with speaking. It is also connected with how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar instruction, but it did not have this same change. It is too early to say how much influence these instructions have on language, but the answers might one day be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2' because it is too simple for the target B1 level. The primary issue is sentence structure. The output uses a series of very short, simple sentences, which makes the text choppy and characteristic of an A2 level. For example, 'This change seems to be connected with speaking. It is also connected with how our brains control our mouths and face.' To fix this, combine some of these short sentences to create more complex structures appropriate for B1. A better version would be: 'This change seems to be connected with both speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.' While the vocabulary simplification and keyword definition were handled well, the overly simple sentence construction is the reason for the failure.",
