The text fails to convey the original message.\n\n- Primary Failure: The core concept of online platforms 'providing a chance' or 'opportunity' is lost. Your version, 'Online platforms are open to everyone, but they let people make money,' is a weak and illogical statement. The use of 'but' is incorrect.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8685 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key phrases like 'make a quick buck' and 'hardly worn' were replaced with less precise A2 equivalents, losing too much of the original's lexical detail.\n- Structural Failure: The text is a series of disconnected, choppy sentences. The original text explains a clear cause and effect: parents did not sell before because it was difficult, but now they do because online platforms make it easy. Your version lists facts without this logical connection. For example, 'They spent a lot on these items' is an isolated statement.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the central idea of 'opportunity'. Combine sentences to show the relationship between past and present actions. The sentence 'Before they did not set up a market table or sale' should be directly linked to the new ability to sell online. Fix the illogical first sentence.",

While the simplification is aggressive, it has resulted in a text that does not retain enough lexical similarity to the source.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8655 is a critical failure against the 0.90 standard. Key phrases like 'local market or car boot sale' and 'invested in' were completely removed, causing the low score.\n- B1 Vocabulary/Grammar: The text uses the B1 structure 'used to'. Strict A2 compliance requires avoiding grammatical structures from higher levels.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the fidelity requirement, reintroduce specific keywords from the original text while maintaining simple sentence structures. For example, include 'car boot sales'. Rephrase the sentence containing 'used to' with a simple past tense structure, such as 'In the past, busy parents did not use market stalls'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning is preserved.\n\n- Lexical Deviation: The simplification process was too aggressive. Key phrases were altered unnecessarily, causing the fidelity score to drop.\n- Example 1: The original phrase 'put some cash back into their pockets' was replaced with 'get cash back from the sales'. This weakens the direct lexical link.\n- Example 2: The original phrase 'hardly worn baby clothes' was replaced with 'almost new baby clothes'. This is a similar but lexically different phrase.\n- Nuance Loss: The original states parents 'might not have bothered', which implies a choice based on effort. Your version states they 'did not use' these methods, which is an overly strong and factually different statement.\n- Redundancy: The sentences 'They spent a lot on these items' and 'They invested in the equipment' are repetitive and break the flow. The original text combines these concepts more efficiently.\n\nSuggestion: Adhere more closely to the original's vocabulary where it is A2-compliant. Restore phrases like 'put cash back' to improve the fidelity score. Correct the statement about past behavior to reflect the nuance of 'might not have bothered' instead of the definitive 'did not use'.",
