    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8665 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning is preserved.\n\n- Lexical Deviation: The simplification process was too aggressive. Key phrases were altered unnecessarily, causing the fidelity score to drop.\n- Example 1: The original phrase 'put some cash back into their pockets' was replaced with 'get cash back from the sales'. This weakens the direct lexical link.\n- Example 2: The original phrase 'hardly worn baby clothes' was replaced with 'almost new baby clothes'. This is a similar but lexically different phrase.\n- Nuance Loss: The original states parents 'might not have bothered', which implies a choice based on effort. Your version states they 'did not use' these methods, which is an overly strong and factually different statement.\n- Redundancy: The sentences 'They spent a lot on these items' and 'They invested in the equipment' are repetitive and break the flow. The original text combines these concepts more efficiently.\n\nSuggestion: Adhere more closely to the original's vocabulary where it is A2-compliant. Restore phrases like 'put cash back' to improve the fidelity score. Correct the statement about past behavior to reflect the nuance of 'might not have bothered' instead of the definitive 'did not use'.",
