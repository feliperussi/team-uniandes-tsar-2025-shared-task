This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and nuance.\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original text's powerful concepts of 'empowerment' and societal 'discouragement' were over-simplified to 'make strong' and 'tells them not to'. This simplification strips the text of its intended emotional and social weight, which is why the meaning score is low.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The word 'spin' is classified as C1 level. Its use is an absolute violation of the A2 standard. This word is far too advanced for the target reader.\n*   **Nuance Deletion:** The original states Wasfia 'reluctantly' watched, which implies a conflict between her desire and societal rules. Your version, 'Wasfia only watched', removes this critical piece of characterization.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the core meaning of 'empowerment' using A2 vocabulary, for example, 'to help women and girls believe they can do anything'. Replace the C1 word 'spin' with an A2-level description, such as 'move it around and around your body'."

'Discourages' implies a social belief or pressure, not a formal 'rule'. Your simplification fundamentally alters her motivation from challenging a social norm to breaking a law, which is a different and inaccurate message.\n*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is appropriately A2. This is a positive point.\n*   **Structure:** The sentence structure is simple and compliant with A2 standards. This is also a positive point.\n\nDespite the correct structure and vocabulary, the failure to preserve the original text's nuanced meaning is a critical flaw that cannot be overlooked.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6474, which is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The original's direct and impactful purpose, 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport,' was diluted into a multi-sentence explanation that lost its force. This over-simplification fundamentally altered the nuance of the text.\n\nAdditional violations detected:\n\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The text uses the B1-level words 'powerful' and 'confident'. This is an explicit violation of the A2 standard. These words are not permissible.\n*   **Interpretive Error:** The sentence 'This makes women and girls feel weak' is an interpretation, not a simplification. It adds information not present in the source text, contributing to the low meaning preservation score.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n\n*   **Action:** Remove the B1 words 'powerful' and 'confident'. Replace them with A2-level concepts like 'strong' or 'good about themselves'.\n*   **Action:** Remove the interpretive sentence 'This makes women and girls feel weak'.\n*   **Action:** Rephrase the final section to more accurately reflect the original's direct purpose. A compliant alternative would be: 'She did this to help women and girls. In her country, people say girls should not do sports. Wasfia wanted to show them that they can be strong.'"

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message due to over-simplification.\n\n*   **Meaning Degradation:** The original text's core message is centered on the concepts of 'empowerment' and societal 'discouragement'. Your output reduces these complex ideas to 'help women and girls' and 'show them that they can be strong'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the specific, powerful nuance of overcoming active societal pressure to gain confidence and power. The core reason for her actions has been diluted.\n*   **Factual Integrity:** The text is factually correct. This is not the point of failure.\n*   **CEFR Compliance:** The text correctly classifies as A2. This is not the point of failure.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the final sentences to capture the concept of 'empowerment' more directly without using the B1 word itself. Command: Change 'She did this to help women and girls' to something more precise, such as 'She did this to give women and girls in her country more confidence and power.'"
