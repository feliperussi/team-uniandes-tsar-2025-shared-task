    "text_translated": "A hula hoop is a big plastic ring. You can move it around and around your body. When Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl, she saw a hula hoop for the first time. A child from another country was in her country, Bangladesh, and was playing with one. Wasfia wanted to play, but she could only watch. In her country, people said girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is a famous woman. She climbed the seven highest mountains in the world, like Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is one of the few people in the world to do this. She was also the first person to play with a hula hoop on top of each mountain. She did this to give women and girls in her country more confidence and power, because people there say girls should not do sports.",

It provides specific, actionable evidence by contrasting the original text's 'discourages' with the weaker 'people there say' and correctly identifies the vocabulary violation of 'confidence'. The suggestions are concrete and directly address the identified issues.",
