The core message regarding the Capitol's purpose for the Hunger Games has been lost. The original text states the event is used 'to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. Your version simplifies this to 'It wants to punish other areas. These areas fought against the Capitol.' This simplification loses the crucial nuance that the event itself serves as a constant reminder and a tool of control, not merely an act of punishment. The symbolic and psychological aspect of the event is absent. Suggestion: Rephrase the purpose of the Hunger Games to clearly state that the Capitol uses the event to make people remember their past rebellion and punishment. For example, 'The Capitol uses the Hunger Games so people remember they are punished for fighting against it.'",

The simplified text, while covering surface facts, fails to convey the deeper semantic connections and nuances present in the original. This is a critical failure in maintaining the essence of the source material. Detected deviations: - Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6551 is too low. The text does not fully capture the nuances of the original message, despite appearing to cover the main points. This suggests a lack of deeper semantic connection. Suggestion: Review the original text's underlying purpose and tone to ensure all subtle meanings are conveyed in the simplified version. - Vocabulary: The word 'hunger' in 'The Hunger Games' is classified as B1. For A2 compliance, all vocabulary must be at an A2 level or lower. Suggestion: While 'The Hunger Games' is a proper noun, the word 'hunger' itself is above A2. Consider if the concept of 'hunger' can be implicitly understood or if a simpler descriptor for the event's name is possible, or if 'hunger' needs a simple A2 definition. - Vocabulary: The word 'fighting' is classified as B1. For A2 compliance, all vocabulary must be at an A2 level or lower. Suggestion: Replace 'fighting' with an A2 equivalent such as 'war' or 'battle' or 'struggle', or rephrase the sentence to avoid the B1 word.",

The core message regarding the explicit purpose of the Hunger Games as a direct reminder of punishment for rebellion is significantly weakened. The text fails to convey the precise relationship between the event and its intended message as clearly as the original. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation: The original text states, 'The Hunger Games are an annual event, which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling.' Your version separates this into 'The Capitol uses this event. It makes the areas remember. They are punished for fighting.' This breakdown dilutes the direct causal link and the Capitol's explicit intent, losing the strong connection of the event *being* the reminder of punishment.\n- Vocabulary Precision: The word 'fighting' is used instead of 'rebelling'. While 'fighting' is an A2 word, 'rebelling' carries a specific political connotation of an uprising against authority that 'fighting' does not fully capture, contributing to the loss of the original's precise meaning.\n- Phrasing Clarity: The phrase 'Only one person can live from this fight' is less direct and slightly awkward compared to the original's 'only one person can survive'. While understandable, it lacks the conciseness and natural flow of the original.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the opening sentences to explicitly link the Capitol's *purpose* for the event as a direct reminder of punishment for past actions. Ensure the causal relationship is clear and concise.\n- Reconsider the simplification of 'rebelling'. If 'rebelling' is too complex, use a more specific A2 phrase that conveys the idea of an uprising against authority, such as 'fighting against the government', rather than the more general 'fighting'.\n- Use more direct and natural phrasing for survival, such as 'only one person can survive', to maintain clarity and fidelity to the original meaning.",
