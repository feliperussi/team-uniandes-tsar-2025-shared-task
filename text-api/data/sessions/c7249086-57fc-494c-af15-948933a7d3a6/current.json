The word 'punish' is explicitly listed as a B1 vocabulary candidate. An A2 text must strictly adhere to A2 vocabulary. All other checks passed, including factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.8149), and fidelity (BERTScore 0.923), and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2, but the explicit vocabulary list provided overrides this for specific words. Suggestion: Replace 'punish' with an A2 equivalent phrase, such as 'make them feel bad for' or 'give them a bad time for'.",
