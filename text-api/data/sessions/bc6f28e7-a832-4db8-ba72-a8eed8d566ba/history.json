The original conveys a sense of danger and endurance that your version flattens into a simple sequence of events.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the introduction to restore the concept of seeking difficult challenges.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text conveys a sense of extreme adventure and remarkable achievement. Your version reduces these events to a simple list of facts, losing the essential meaning of the text. The replacement of specific, powerful nouns like 'South Pole' and 'glacier' with generic descriptions contributes significantly to this loss.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses B1-level vocabulary, which is an immediate failure for an A2 assessment. The word 'challenge' appears in the first sentence. The word 'southern' appears twice. These words are not on the A2 list and must be removed.\n\n- Lexical Simplification Error: While simplifying 'South Pole' is a valid strategy, the chosen replacement 'the most southern place on Earth' introduced a B1-level word ('southern'), creating a new error. A better A2-compliant description is needed.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of extreme difficulty and achievement. Remove the B1 words 'challenge' and 'southern'. Replace 'challenge' with a phrase like 'a new, difficult thing to do'. Replace 'the most southern place on Earth' with 'the South Pole' (as a proper noun) or an A2-level description like 'the very bottom of the world'.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text's opening, 'Not content with one amazing trip, some of today's adventurers go from challenge to challenge,' establishes a specific theme of dissatisfaction and continuous challenge-seeking. Your version, 'Some people always want to do something new and difficult,' is a generic simplification that loses this core nuance. The low MeaningBERT score directly reflects this loss of specific meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'pole' is classified as C1 level. Its use in 'South Pole' is not appropriate for an A2 text without simplification or a simple definition. The text is about a specific place, but the vocabulary level is too high.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The original text describes a 'glacier'. Your simplification to 'a big river of ice' is a valid A2 strategy, but combined with other meaning shifts, it contributed to the overall drop in semantic similarity.\n\nSuggestion: The introduction must be rewritten to more accurately reflect the original's concept of 'not being content'. For example: 'For some adventurers, one big trip is not enough. They look for a new challenge.' Address the C1 vocabulary by providing a simple A2 definition for the key location. For example: 'She went to the South Pole. This is the most southern place in the world.'",
