    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8993 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'defend' is B1 level. It is not permitted in an A2 text. The text must strictly adhere to A1/A2 vocabulary.\n- Fidelity Loss: The phrase 'track these objects' was simplified to 'watch them', losing lexical precision. The phrase 'defence solutions could be launched' was simplified to 'ways to defend Earth', which also contributes to the score reduction.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'defend' with an A2-level alternative like 'protect' or 'keep Earth safe'. Rephrase to restore key vocabulary. Change 'watch them' to 'follow them' to better match the original meaning and improve the fidelity score.",
