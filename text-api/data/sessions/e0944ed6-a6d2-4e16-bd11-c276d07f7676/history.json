The original text specifies these asteroids pass 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your version simplifies this to 'very close to Earth', which is factually insufficient and removes the key defining information.\n- Secondary Deviation: The BERTScore of 0.892 is below the minimum of 0.90. This confirms that essential lexical details from the source text were lost due to oversimplification.\n- Suggestion: You must restore the critical factual data.

A secondary failure is the BERTScore, which is below the minimum threshold.\n\n- CEFR Classification Error: The text was classified as B1. The goal is A2. This is an instant failure.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word 'defence' is B1 level and was not simplified. The phrase 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' was retained, which includes B2-level vocabulary ('hazardous'). This is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\n- B1 Grammar: The sentence 'NASA can know if an asteroid will hit Earth' uses a conditional 'if-clause', which is a B1 grammatical structure. The next sentence, 'If this happens...', repeats this B1-level complexity.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.899 is below the required 0.90. This indicates an unacceptable deviation from the original text's key phrasing.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove the word 'defence'. Replace it with a simple A2 description like 'two plans to stop it'.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8957 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of the concept of 'prediction'. The original text states NASA makes 'predictions about possible impact'. Your text changes this to 'NASA can know an asteroid will hit Earth'. This is a severe factual alteration, changing a probability into a certainty.\n\n- The original text defines a specific category: 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. Your text removes this classification and speaks generally about 'some asteroids', losing the specific definitional purpose of the first sentence.\n\n- The BERTScore is low because key terms like 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' and 'Earth's orbit' were completely removed instead of being simplified, resulting in a loss of fidelity.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the meaning of 'prediction'. The sentence must be changed to reflect that NASA predicts, it does not know for certain. For example: 'NASA can predict if an asteroid will hit Earth.'\n\n- Suggestion: Reintroduce the concept of a specific category. Start with a sentence like: 'NASA has a name for dangerous asteroids: Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.'",
