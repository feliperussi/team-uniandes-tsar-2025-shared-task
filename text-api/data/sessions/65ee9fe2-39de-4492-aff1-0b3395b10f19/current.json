    "text_translated": "An **asteroid** is a rock that flies through space. One way to protect Earth from an asteroid is to make it explode with a nuclear bomb. This idea might seem like a story from a film, and it was even in the 1998 film 'Armageddon'. However, NASA has a real plan for this. It is called HAMMER. HAMMER is a NASA plan to deal with asteroids in an emergency. This plan uses eight-ton rockets, which would be sent towards an asteroid that is coming closer. The hope is that these rockets would push the asteroid and change its direction. But if the asteroid is too close to Earth, this plan would not work. In that case, the rockets would instead carry nuclear bombs to make it explode.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8366 and BERTScore of 0.9099 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex phrases such as 'PHA' to 'asteroid' and omitted the full, lengthy name of HAMMER while retaining its acronym and purpose. The keyword 'asteroid' was correctly defined at the beginning of the text, which is a strong point. Sentence structures were broken down into shorter, more manageable units, improving readability and flow for a B1 learner. Connectors like 'However' and 'In that case' are used appropriately to link ideas. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that adheres to all guidelines and metrics.",
