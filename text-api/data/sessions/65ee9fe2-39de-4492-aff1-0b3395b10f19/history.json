While the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT 0.8454, BERTScore 0.9328), its linguistic complexity exceeds the B1 target. For example, the sentence 'One way to protect Earth from an asteroid, which is a rock that flies through space, is to make it explode with a nuclear bomb' is long and embeds a definition using a non-defining relative clause, which can be challenging for B1 readers. Similarly, 'This plan uses eight-ton rockets, which would be sent towards an asteroid that is coming closer' contains two relative clauses in one sentence, increasing its complexity. To achieve a B1 level, sentences should generally be shorter and contain fewer embedded clauses. Consider breaking down longer sentences into two or more simpler ones. For instance, the first sentence could be split: 'An asteroid is a rock that flies through space. One way to protect Earth from an asteroid is to make it explode with a nuclear bomb.' Also, while the full name of HAMMER is important, presenting it in parentheses within a sentence like 'However, NASA has a real plan for this, called HAMMER (Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response)' adds to the cognitive load; consider introducing the acronym and its full name in separate, simpler sentences or simplifying the explanation of the acronym for B1.",

While the text successfully preserves factual integrity and meaning, and simplifies many aspects, the classifier likely identified the following as contributing to a higher complexity: 1. The full name 'Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response' is included. While it is presented as a definition, the length and technical nature of these words can increase the perceived complexity for a B1 reader. 2. The sentence 'The hope is that these rockets would push the asteroid so it changes its direction' uses a subordinate clause ('so it changes its direction') and a hypothetical 'would push' which, while within B1, can lean towards B2 in combination. 3. The sentence 'But if the asteroid is too close to Earth for this to work, the rockets would instead carry nuclear bombs to make it explode' is a complex conditional sentence with an infinitive clause ('for this to work') that pushes the upper limits of B1. To achieve a B1 classification, consider simplifying the full name of HAMMER further, perhaps by only stating the acronym and explaining its purpose more generally without listing every word. Also, break down complex conditional sentences into simpler, more direct statements or two separate sentences.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8366 and BERTScore of 0.9099 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified complex phrases such as 'PHA' to 'asteroid' and omitted the full, lengthy name of HAMMER while retaining its acronym and purpose. The keyword 'asteroid' was correctly defined at the beginning of the text, which is a strong point. Sentence structures were broken down into shorter, more manageable units, improving readability and flow for a B1 learner. Connectors like 'However' and 'In that case' are used appropriately to link ideas. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that adheres to all guidelines and metrics.",
