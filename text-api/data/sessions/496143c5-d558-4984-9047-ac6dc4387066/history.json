This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The simplification of the central scientific concept is unacceptable. The original text explains the danger of populations becoming 'genetically similar' and how zoos 'increase genetic diversity'. Your version reduces this to 'They become too much like a family' and 'This makes the group of animals stronger'. This is a fatal oversimplification that loses the essential meaning.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8824 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing precise terminology like 'endangered species', 'genetic diversity', and 'safeguard' with vague phrases like 'species that are in danger', 'makes the group of animals stronger', and 'help with this'. This demonstrates a failure to maintain lexical fidelity.\n\n- Structural Competence: While the sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2, this does not compensate for the critical failure to preserve the source text's meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to accurately reflect the concept of genetic diversity. Do not use the analogy 'like a family'. State directly that when there are few animals, they are all too similar, and this is a weakness.

Restore the concept of a 'safeguard' by explaining that these programmes protect the future of the species. Explain 'genetic diversity' using A2 language, for example: 'It is not good if all the animals in a group are from the same family.
