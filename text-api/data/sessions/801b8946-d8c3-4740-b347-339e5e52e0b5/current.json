    "text_translated": "\"Wonder\" is the first novel by RJ Palacio, who lives in New York. On her website, she explains that the idea for the book came to her after seeing a girl with a face that looked different on the street one day. Wonder has been a **bestseller** (a very popular book that sells a lot) in the United States and has already won many awards. Many schools are now using it as a starting point for **discussions** (talks) about **bullying** (being unkind to others), **friendship** (being good friends), and what it's like to be different. A film **version** (a film) of the book is being made, and many, including me, are waiting with excitement to see what RJ Palacio writes next.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8414 and BERTScore of 0.9416 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The writer's simplification strategy is highly effective. They proactively defined several terms (bestseller, discussions, bullying, friendship, version) that, while not explicitly listed as keywords for definition, significantly enhance comprehension for a B1 reader. The definitions provided are clear and concise. Furthermore, the writer skillfully simplified phrases like 'New Yorker' to 'who lives in New York', 'facial deformities' to 'a face that looked different', and 'eagerly' to 'with excitement', all of which are excellent choices for B1. The overall structure and flow of the text are natural and easy to follow. This is a very strong submission that demonstrates a clear understanding of B1 simplification principles.",
