    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6751 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8506 is also below the required 0.90. These failures indicate a severe loss of the original text's core message and factual phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.6751): The original text establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship: failed projects motivated Wasfia to combine her passions to change attitudes. Your version presents these as a series of disconnected facts, losing this central narrative. The simplification is too extreme.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8506): Key phrases that carry specific meaning, such as 'international humanitarian projects', 'change attitudes', and 'stand up for itself', were replaced with overly generic terms like 'projects to help people', 'think better', and 'help itself'. This results in a significant loss of lexical detail.\n\n- Content Error: The text contains an unedited note: 'She wanted people? Actually keep: She wanted people to think better about women in Bangladesh.' This is an instant failure of quality control.\n\n- Structural Flaw: The sentence 'The projects stopped.' is repeated back-to-back, which is grammatically awkward and demonstrates poor editing.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the logical connection between sentences. Use simple connectors like 'so' or 'because' to show that the failed projects caused Wasfia to act. Remove the editing note and the repeated sentence. Re-evaluate the simplification of key terms to retain more of the original's specific meaning while remaining at an A2 level.",
