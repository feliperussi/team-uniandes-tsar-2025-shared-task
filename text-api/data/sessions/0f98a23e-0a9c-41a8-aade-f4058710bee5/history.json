The original text states she 'dedicated her life', which means she has spent her life working on a cause, not that she died for it. This is an instant failure.\n\nAdditional failures detected:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.73 is below the 0.75 threshold. This is a direct result of the factual error, which fundamentally changes the core message about Wasfia's commitment.\n- Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.88 is below the required 0.90. The simplification process lost too much lexical detail from the original text.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is due to specific linguistic violations.\n- B1 Vocabulary. The word 'basic' is not on the A2 word list.\n- B1 Grammar. The sentence 'Human rights are basic freedoms that all people should have' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar. The sentence 'She wanted to change how people view women' uses a noun clause ('how people view women'), which is a B1 structure.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. Rephrase 'dedicated her life' using A2 vocabulary, such as 'worked her whole life to support'. Remove the word 'basic'. Split the complex sentences into simple A2 structures.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary failure is a catastrophic loss of meaning and fidelity, evidenced by metrics that fall far below the minimum standard. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7182 is below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.8788 is below the required 0.90. This indicates that in the process of simplification, the core message and key lexical items were destroyed.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text conveys a strong sense of purpose with phrases like 'dedicated her life', 'change attitudes', and 'doing the trick'. Your output reduces these to weaker, less impactful statements like 'worked her whole life', 'wanted people to think differently', and 'is working'. This simplification is too aggressive and loses the essential meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key terms from the original text were oversimplified, causing the low BERTScore. 'Humanitarian projects' became 'help projects', and 'taking notice' became 'paying attention'. This damages the lexical connection to the source material.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is also an instant failure on CEFR compliance. The classifier rated the output as B1, not the required A2. This is an unacceptable deviation from the target level.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be completely rewritten. Focus on preserving the original's intent and key vocabulary while using A2 structures. Do not dilute strong concepts like 'changing attitudes'. The goal is simplification, not evisceration of meaning. You must achieve scores of at least 0.75 on MeaningBERT and 0.90 on BERTScore while ensuring the final text classifies as A2.",

The impactful idea of 'change attitudes towards women' was flattened into 'change thoughts about women\u2019s role'.\n\n- Structural Simplification: The text has been simplified to the point of being disjointed.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (MeaningBERT): The original text establishes a direct causal link: Wasfia saw failed projects and therefore started her campaign as a way for Bangladesh to 'stand up for itself'. Your version separates these into disconnected facts ('she thought Bangladesh must stand up for itself' and 'She mixed her two passions'), which weakens the central argument and motivation.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8852 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a result of oversimplification that lost lexical fidelity. Key phrases like 'humanitarian projects' and 'change attitudes' were replaced with generic terms, losing important detail from the source.\n\n- Structural Compliance: While the text successfully uses A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures, this is irrelevant due to the failure to maintain the original meaning. Adherence to CEFR level does not compensate for factual and semantic degradation.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite to restore the cause-and-effect relationship.

The text also fails on CEFR compliance.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The primary cause for the low BERTScore is the alteration of meaning. The original text states the campaign is 'doing the trick', which means it is succeeding. Your version, 'Her campaign brings attention', changes the meaning from success to simple awareness.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 classification is a result of specific vocabulary and grammar violations.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: You used the C1 word 'humanitarian' and the B1 word 'campaign'. These words are too advanced for the A2 level and must be replaced.\n\n- Structural Violation: The text uses B1 grammatical structures. The sentence 'Human rights are the rights that every person has' uses a relative 'that-clause'. The sentence 'She began climbing while she worked on projects...' uses the subordinating conjunction 'while'. These structures are too complex for A2.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the original meaning of success. Replace 'Her campaign brings attention' with 'Her work is successful'. Remove the word 'humanitarian'; use 'projects to help people' instead. Remove the word 'campaign'; use 'her work'. Break complex sentences into simple A2 sentences. For example: 'Every person has rights. These are called human rights.' And: 'She worked on projects in Tibet and Nepal. At that time, she began climbing.'",

The simplification is too extreme.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8506): Key phrases that carry specific meaning, such as 'international humanitarian projects', 'change attitudes', and 'stand up for itself', were replaced with overly generic terms like 'projects to help people', 'think better', and 'help itself'. This results in a significant loss of lexical detail.\n\n- Content Error: The text contains an unedited note: 'She wanted people? Actually keep: She wanted people to think better about women in Bangladesh.' This is an instant failure of quality control.\n\n- Structural Flaw: The sentence 'The projects stopped.' is repeated back-to-back, which is grammatically awkward and demonstrates poor editing.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the logical connection between sentences. Use simple connectors like 'so' or 'because' to show that the failed projects caused Wasfia to act. Remove the editing note and the repeated sentence.
