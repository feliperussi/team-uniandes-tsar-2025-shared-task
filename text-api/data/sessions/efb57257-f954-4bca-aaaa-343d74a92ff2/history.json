This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nThe text was over-simplified into a series of short, disconnected sentences. This process removed the logical connections (cause, effect, purpose) present in the original text.\nThe original states Gerlinde climbs without oxygen 'to increase the challenge'. Your version, 'She makes it very hard for herself', is a weaker statement that loses the specific meaning of purpose.\nThe original links the risk to the cause: 'This is risky as low oxygen levels...'. Your version presents two separate facts: 'This is dangerous. On high mountains, there is not much oxygen.' The causal link is lost.\nThe original states she uses her fame 'to support a charity'. This shows a clear purpose. Your version, 'She helps a charity', is a simple statement of fact and loses the strength of the original's intent.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce simple A2 connectors like 'and', 'so', and 'because' to link related ideas. Combine some of the shortest sentences to restore the logical flow. Example: 'This is dangerous because on high mountains there is not much oxygen.' This restores the cause-and-effect relationship.",

Your simplification to 'the highest mountains in the world' is too general and loses this core factual information, which is the primary cause of the low meaning score.\n*   Structural Deviation: The text splits single concepts across multiple sentences, which can weaken the direct causal links present in the original text. For example, 'Gerlinde uses her fame as a climber to support a charity' is a single, strong idea. Your version splits this into two sentences, slightly diluting the connection.\n*   Suggestion: Restore the specific detail of '8,000 metre peaks' but explain it in simple terms. Rephrase to combine related ideas into single sentences where possible using A2 connectors. Example: 'She decided to climb the fourteen highest mountains. These mountains are all over 8,000 metres high.'",
