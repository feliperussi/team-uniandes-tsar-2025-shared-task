The MeaningBERT score of 0.9033 and BERTScore of 0.9161 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is strictly A2, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using only basic A1/A2 connectors. The simplification of 'vague' to 'not clear' and 'managing the situation satisfactorily' to 'help with the problem well' are excellent examples of appropriate A2 rephrasing. The use of direct speech for the manager's questions is also suitable for A2. The omission of 'Swedish' is an acceptable simplification for A2 as it does not alter the core message.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning is preserved. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9033 and BERTScore of 0.9161 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been meticulously simplified, replacing B1/B2 terms like 'frustration', 'issues', 'performing', 'collaborate', 'vague', and 'satisfactorily' with appropriate A1/A2 equivalents such as 'unhappy', 'problems', 'working well', 'work better', 'not clear', and 'help with the problem well'. Sentence structures are short, simple, and direct, avoiding complex clauses and using basic connectors suitable for the A2 level. This is a model example of effective A2 simplification.",
