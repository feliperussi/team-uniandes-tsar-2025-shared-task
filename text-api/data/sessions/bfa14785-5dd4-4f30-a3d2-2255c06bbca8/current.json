    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards and adheres to the rigorous diagnostic protocol. Factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning is preserved. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9033 and BERTScore of 0.9161 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been meticulously simplified, replacing B1/B2 terms like 'frustration', 'issues', 'performing', 'collaborate', 'vague', and 'satisfactorily' with appropriate A1/A2 equivalents such as 'unhappy', 'problems', 'working well', 'work better', 'not clear', and 'help with the problem well'. Sentence structures are short, simple, and direct, avoiding complex clauses and using basic connectors suitable for the A2 level. This is a model example of effective A2 simplification.",
