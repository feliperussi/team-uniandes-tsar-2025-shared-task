This is a major contributor to the low MeaningBERT score.\n- The replacement of 'studied' with 'watched' changes the meaning. 'Studied' implies a formal, scientific process, whereas 'watched' is too casual and imprecise.\n- The replacement of 'abandoned by their owners' with 'pets that people left' loses the specific relationship (owner) and the negative connotation of abandonment.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning with A2-compliant vocabulary.

For example, 'adapted remarkably successfully to urban life' was changed to 'adapted very well to city life'. While the meaning is similar, the fidelity to the original phrasing is lost, causing the score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1-level word 'adaptation' was used in the sentence 'Their adaptation was very good and surprising.' This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard. All words must be at or below the A2 level.\n\n- Redundancy: The sentence 'Their adaptation was very good and surprising' is redundant. The previous sentence, 'They found that the dogs adapted very well to city life,' already conveys this information using an A2-appropriate verb ('adapted').\n\nSuggestion: Delete the sentence 'Their adaptation was very good and surprising.'

Sentence structures are simple and clear, using appropriate A2 connectors like 'and' and 'while'. The simplification of 'remarkably successfully' to 'very well' and 'appear to' to 'seem' is executed perfectly. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
