The linguistic features align perfectly with this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. Sentence structures are simple and clear, using appropriate A2 connectors like 'and' and 'while'. The simplification of 'remarkably successfully' to 'very well' and 'appear to' to 'seem' is executed perfectly. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
