This indicates the core message was not preserved.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of the logical connection from the original text. The original states Springsteen is successful BECAUSE he tells important stories. Your version lists these as separate, disconnected facts, which fundamentally changes the meaning.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8898 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to replacing key phrases like 'top of his game' and 'fundamental stories' with overly simple alternatives that lose precision.\n- The text is broken into too many short sentences. This choppy structure destroys the logical flow of the original argument.\n\nSuggestion: Combine sentences to restore the cause-and-effect relationship. Use 'because' to link his success to the stories he tells. For example: 'He is still one of the best because he tells very important stories about people.'",

A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8929, which is below the minimum fidelity requirement of 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text states Springsteen tells 'our most fundamental stories about ourselves'. Your version, 'tells very important stories about people', loses the personal and introspective meaning. The shift from 'us' to 'people' is a substantial change in the core message.\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore failure is due to replacing key phrases. 'Best-selling album artists' became 'famous singers' and 'remains at the top of his game' became 'still one of the best'. These simplifications lose too much lexical detail from the source.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification was too aggressive and sacrificed meaning. You must rephrase to restore the lost concepts. Change 'tells very important stories about people' to 'tells stories that are important for us' to recapture the original's personal connection. The primary goal is to simplify language, not to erase the central idea.",
