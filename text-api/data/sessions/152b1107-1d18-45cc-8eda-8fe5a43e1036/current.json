    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standards.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. The age reference 'almost 70 years old' is an accurate simplification of 'in his late 60s'.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8065 and BERTScore of 0.9001 meet the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structures are simple, short, and use appropriate A2-level connectors. The breakdown of the original complex sentence into multiple simple sentences is exemplary. No deviations were found.",
