The likely cause is the rephrasing of the final sentence. The original text states the temporary nature of art 'reflects how life is full of change', which is an interpretation. The output changes this to 'because for her this shows that life is full of change', which introduces a direct cause-and-effect relationship not present in the original. This alters the nuance of the artist's philosophy. Suggestion: Rephrase the final clause to better match the original's reflective tone, for example, by stating 'For her, this shows that life is full of change...' without the strong causal word 'because'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The submission fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.63 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original's core message. This is likely due to cumulative changes, such as removing the descriptor 'big' from 'big, colourful pictures' and altering the nuance of 'likes to explore' to the more functional 'looks for new places to work'. Additionally, the submission fails the Fidelity Check. The BERTScore of 0.87 is below the 0.90 threshold, reflecting an excessive loss of key vocabulary from the original text. The text also fails on CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as B2, not the target B1. This is primarily caused by the first sentence, which uses a complex structure with a non-defining relative clause ('Faith47, who comes from...'). To fix this, split the first sentence into two simpler ones. For example: 'Faith47 is from Cape Town in South Africa. She creates colourful paintings...'. Finally, the B2-level word 'council' should have been simplified for a B1 audience (e.g., 'city workers').",

The original text states the art is removed by 'cleaners from the city council', but the output incorrectly states 'cleaners from the city workers'. A 'city council' is a specific governing body, while 'city workers' is a generic term; this change alters a key fact about who removes the art.\n\nAdditionally, the submission fails on CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. This over-simplification is likely due to the cumulative effect of several vocabulary changes, such as replacing 'reflects' with 'shows' and 'removed' with 'washed away'.\n\nTo correct this, first, restore the factual accuracy by changing 'city workers' back to 'city council'. Second, to meet the B1 requirement, consider retaining some of the original's slightly more advanced vocabulary, such as keeping the verb 'reflects', which is more appropriate for a B1 level than 'shows'.",
