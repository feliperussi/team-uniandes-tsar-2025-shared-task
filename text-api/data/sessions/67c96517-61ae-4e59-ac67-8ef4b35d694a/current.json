    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.97) are very high, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategies are effective, particularly the splitting of complex sentences and the simplification of phrases like 'cleaners from the city council' to 'city cleaners'. The replacement of 'reflects' with 'shows' is also a strong choice. For future improvement, consider the change from 'likes' (A1) to 'appreciates' (B2). While it works in context, a simpler alternative like 'She likes that...' would be more aligned with the goal of reducing complexity. Overall, this is a high-quality submission.",
