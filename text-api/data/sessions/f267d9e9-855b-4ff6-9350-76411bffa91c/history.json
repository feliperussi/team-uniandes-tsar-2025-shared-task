Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8929 is below the minimum fidelity requirement of 0.90, confirming that key lexical information was lost.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text's concepts of 'unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' are semantically strong. Your replacements, 'things that were not fair' and 'people were very angry', are too general and lose the specific meaning of formal accusation and widespread public opposition.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore failure is a direct result of replacing key terms like 'unethical', 'accusations', 'suppliers', 'environment', and 'pact' with overly simplistic words. This simplification sacrificed factual precision.\n\n- CEFR Level: While the output was correctly classified as A2, it achieved this level by failing the more important task of preserving the original text's meaning and fidelity. The simplification was too aggressive.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to retain the core concepts. Do not replace 'unethical acts' with a vague phrase; simplify it while keeping the meaning, for example, 'doing bad or wrong things'. The concept of a 'pact' must be conveyed as a formal, serious agreement, not just a 'promise'.",
