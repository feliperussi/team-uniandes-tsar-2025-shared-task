Sometimes, people build the bridge with bad things. Or an important part of the bridge has a problem. In other cases, a bridge can only hold some weight. It cannot hold more.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a perfect example of A2 simplification. It maintains factual accuracy while using short, declarative sentences. The vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. The simplification of 'engineers' to 'the people who build bridges' and 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad things' is excellent for this level.",
