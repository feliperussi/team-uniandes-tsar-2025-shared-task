    "text_translated": "Sometimes a bridge falls down and people do not know why. Engineers need to do a complete study to understand the reason. Sometimes, this happens because the material in the bridge was bad. Or it happens because an important part of the bridge had a problem. In other cases, the builders made the bridge for a certain weight. The bridge could not support more weight.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. All sentences are simple, declarative, and short. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level, effectively replacing complex terms like 'collapses' with 'falls down', 'investigation' with 'study', and 'defect' with 'had a problem'. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary.",
