    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. While the simplification is factually correct, preserves meaning well (as shown by high MeaningBERT and BERTScore values), and successfully defines the keyword 'contraception', the sentence structure is overly simplified for the B1 level. The strategy of breaking the original text into very short, declarative sentences (e.g., 'This led to rapid population growth.') resulted in a text that lacks the complexity expected at B1. To improve, try to combine some of these short sentences using B1 connectors like 'because' or 'which'. For example, 'Because of improvements in technology and health, fewer children died young, which led to rapid population growth.' This would create a more fluent text with the sentence variety needed for a B1 classification.",
