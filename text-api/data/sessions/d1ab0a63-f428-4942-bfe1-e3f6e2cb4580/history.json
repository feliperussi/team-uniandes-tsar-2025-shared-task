While the output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, its grammatical structure is too advanced. The primary issue is the final sentence: 'However, when contraception, which are methods used to prevent pregnancy, became more widely available in the 1960s, the global average number of babies per woman has fallen from six to as low as two.' This sentence is overly long and contains multiple clauses, including an embedded non-defining relative clause used for the definition. This complex structure is characteristic of a B2 level. Suggestion: To achieve a B1 level, the definition and the main point should be in separate, simpler sentences. For example: 'Contraception means using methods to prevent pregnancy. In the 1960s, contraception became easier for people to get. As a result, the average number of babies per woman fell from six to two.'",

Using a 'that' clause followed by a 'which' clause that refers to the entire preceding idea is a B2-level structure. To fix this, split the sentence into two or three simpler ideas. For example: 'In the last two hundred years, technology and health improved. This meant fewer children died young, and it led to rapid population growth.'
