This indicates the core message and nuance of the original text were lost. The BERTScore of 0.8454 also fails to meet the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key phrasing.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of using B1 grammatical structures.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentences 'She told people that rats are not dirty' and 'She said rats can be great pets' use reported speech with 'that-clauses'. This is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'she knows why people respond badly' uses a subordinate clause beginning with 'why', which is a B1 structure.\n- Lexical Simplification Error: The original phrase 'lost count of the times she's patiently tried to explain' was reduced to 'She cannot count how many times she tried to explain', losing the important A2 concept of 'patiently'.\n\nSuggestion: Eliminate all B1 grammatical structures. Rephrase reported speech into simple, direct statements. For example, instead of 'She told people that rats are not dirty', write 'Chloe tells people rats are clean.' Instead of 'she knows why people respond badly', write 'She understands why people do not like them.' All sentences must be simple declarative statements or use only A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', or 'because'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The primary failure is the replacement of specific original phrases with simpler terms that, while preserving general meaning, are too lexically distant.\n- The phrase 'lost count of the times' was replaced with 'many times'. This loses the specific nuance of the original.\n- The phrase 'react badly' was replaced with 'do not like them'. This is a simplification that changes the action (reacting) into a state (liking).\n- The adjectives 'affectionate and intelligent' were replaced with 'loving and smart'. While 'smart' is an acceptable A2 synonym for 'intelligent', the combination of these changes contributed to the score drop.\n- The text successfully meets the A2 classification and preserves the core message, but it fails the strict fidelity requirement.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the fidelity standard, rephrase more carefully. Retain original A2-level words where possible. Instead of replacing 'react badly', consider a simplification like 'have a bad feeling' or 'do not react well'. This maintains closer lexical ties to the source.",
