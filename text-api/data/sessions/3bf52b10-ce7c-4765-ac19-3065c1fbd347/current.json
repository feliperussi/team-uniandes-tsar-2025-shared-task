Complex sentences from the original have been systematically broken down into short, simple declarative sentences. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. The simplification of the B2 word 'affectionate' to the A1 word 'friendly' is a perfect execution of A2 standards. The text is a model of A2 simplification.",
