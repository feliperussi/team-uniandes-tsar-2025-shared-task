This is likely because the simplification of key concepts weakened their original meaning. The original text's goal 'to empower women' was changed to 'to encourage and give confidence'. While similar, 'empower' implies giving power and agency, a stronger concept than encouragement. Additionally, 'a country which discourages them' implies a systemic pressure that is not fully captured by 'where they are often told not to'. Suggestion: To improve the score, find a B1-level phrasing that retains more of the original's strength, such as 'to help women and girls become stronger and more independent'."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The submission fails on two critical Priority 2 metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.682 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a significant shift in the core message. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8687 is below the required 0.90, showing a loss of key lexical items from the original. The primary cause for these low scores is likely the simplification of the key concept 'to empower women' into the much longer phrase 'to help women and girls in her country become stronger and more independent'. While this is a good simplification in spirit, the significant change in wording and structure negatively impacted the metrics. On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, correctly classified as B1, and successfully defines the keyword 'hula hoop'. To pass, the simplification must retain a higher degree of semantic and lexical similarity to the original. Suggestion: Revise the final sentence to use a more direct simplification of 'empower', such as 'to give women and girls more power and confidence', which might better preserve the original's meaning for the metrics."

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all key details from the original text accurately represented. The MeaningBERT (0.76) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The handling of vocabulary was outstanding. The keyword 'hula hoop' was defined clearly and integrated seamlessly into the sentence. Furthermore, complex concepts like 'empower' were skillfully simplified to the B1-appropriate phrase 'give more power and confidence', which is a model of good practice. The structure is clear and the flow is logical. No improvements are necessary."
