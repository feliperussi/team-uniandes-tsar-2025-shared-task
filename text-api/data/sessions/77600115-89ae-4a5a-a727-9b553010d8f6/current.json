    "text_translated": "When Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl in her home country of Bangladesh, she saw a foreign child playing with a hula hoop, which is a large ring that you spin around your body. Although she wanted to play, she could only watch because people there believed that girls should not do things like play with hula hoops or ride bikes.\n\nNow, Wasfia has become one of the few people in the world to climb the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro, and she is the first person who has hula-hooped on the top of each mountain. She does this to give women and girls in her country more power and confidence, as they are often discouraged from doing sports.",
