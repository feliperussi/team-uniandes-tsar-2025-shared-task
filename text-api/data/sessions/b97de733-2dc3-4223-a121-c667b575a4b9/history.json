        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target level. This failure occurred despite the text being factually correct and preserving the original meaning well. The downgrade to A2 is likely due to excessive vocabulary simplification. Key B1/B2 words from the original, such as 'transformation', 'meaningful', and 'additionally', were replaced with simpler A1/A2 equivalents like 'change', 'important', and 'also'. This cumulative effect lowered the overall lexical profile of the text. To reach the B1 target, reintroduce some of the more advanced but still accessible vocabulary. For instance, keeping the word 'transformation' instead of simplifying it to 'change' would help elevate the text to the B1 level without sacrificing clarity.",

The simplification of complex phrases like 'increased their income' to 'started to earn more money' is particularly effective for the B1 level. The text maintains a clear and logical flow. To achieve a perfect score, focus on replacing all C1/B2 vocabulary. The words 'transformation' (C1), 'meaningful' (C1), and 'Additionally' (B2) were retained from the original. Consider replacing 'transformation' with 'big change', 'meaningful change' with 'important change', and 'Additionally' with 'Also' to fully align the text with B1 vocabulary expectations.",
