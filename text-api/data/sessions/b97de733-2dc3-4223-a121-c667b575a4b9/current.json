However, this idea is very different from the truth, because a great transformation is actually happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have started to earn more money and have escaped poverty. Additionally, six million fewer children die from disease every year, millions more girls are going to school, and many more people now have access to clean water.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all primary checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. The simplification of complex phrases like 'increased their income' to 'started to earn more money' is particularly effective for the B1 level. The text maintains a clear and logical flow. To achieve a perfect score, focus on replacing all C1/B2 vocabulary. The words 'transformation' (C1), 'meaningful' (C1), and 'Additionally' (B2) were retained from the original. Consider replacing 'transformation' with 'big change', 'meaningful change' with 'important change', and 'Additionally' with 'Also' to fully align the text with B1 vocabulary expectations.",
