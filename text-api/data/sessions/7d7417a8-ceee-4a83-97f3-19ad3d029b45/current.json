    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8904 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text. While simplification is required, the lexical fidelity is too low.\n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is an immediate failure. The target level is A2.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'making' is classified as B2 level. This word is too advanced for an A2 text and is the primary reason for the incorrect B1 classification. A2 vocabulary must be strictly enforced.\n- Fidelity Loss: The replacement of 'analyses' with 'checks' and 'replenishing the supply' with 'making more' contributed to the low BERTScore. The simplification was too aggressive, losing necessary detail.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Replace the B2 word 'making'. Rephrase the sentence to use A2 vocabulary. Example: 'Something on Mars produces new methane.' or 'There is new methane on Mars.'\n- Suggestion: To improve the fidelity score, use more precise A2 verbs. 'Checks' is acceptable, but the overall loss of precision across the text resulted in a score below the minimum threshold.",
