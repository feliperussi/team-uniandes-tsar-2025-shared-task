This is a direct violation of the core task.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'tiny' is B1 level. The word 'making' is B2 level. These words are too advanced for the A2 standard.\n\n- Structural Error: The line 'Methane? (Oops)' is not a valid sentence and is inappropriate for this task.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove all fabricated content immediately. Replace 'tiny' with 'small'. Replace 'making' with an A2-compliant phrase like 'produces'.",

The sentence 'The amount of methane goes up and down in different seasons' introduces a conceptual complexity that elevates the text to B1.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to improve lexical fidelity while maintaining simplicity.

'Checks' is acceptable, but the overall loss of precision across the text resulted in a score below the minimum threshold.",
