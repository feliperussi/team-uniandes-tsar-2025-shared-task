The text is a model of A2 simplification.\n- Qualitative Audit: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. Complex concepts like 'identical' and 'cranes' were correctly simplified to 'look the same' and 'big machines'. Sentence structure is exemplary, using short, simple sentences connected only by 'and' and 'so'.",
