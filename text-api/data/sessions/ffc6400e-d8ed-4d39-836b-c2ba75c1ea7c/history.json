It is a model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, names, and concepts from the original text are accurately preserved.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.829 and BERTScore of 0.9234 are well above the required thresholds, confirming the core message and key terms were maintained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2, meeting the target level precisely.\n- Qualitative Audit: The analysis is flawless. Complex sentences were systematically broken down into short, simple declarative statements. The B1-level concept 'identical' was correctly simplified to the A1 phrase 'look the same'. The specific noun 'cranes' was appropriately replaced with the general A2-level description 'big machines'. The use of connectors is limited to simple A2 forms like 'so'. The vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. No corrections are required.",
