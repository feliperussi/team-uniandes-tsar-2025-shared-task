While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves meaning well (as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores), the linguistic features fall below the B1 threshold. This is likely due to the consistent use of simple sentence structures and the simplification of all complex vocabulary (e.g., 'mutated' became 'change'). To reach the B1 target, consider re-introducing slightly more complex sentence patterns or combining some of the shorter sentences. For example, using a relative clause like 'a gene that changed' instead of 'a change in a gene which happened' could increase the complexity appropriately without sacrificing clarity.",
