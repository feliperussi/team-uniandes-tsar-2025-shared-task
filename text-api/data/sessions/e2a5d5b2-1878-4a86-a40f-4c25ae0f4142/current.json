For example, did a special gene change in a way that gave us the ability to speak? Researchers have found a gene that changed between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected with speaking. It also relates to how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not have this same change. It is too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. The simplification, while factually accurate and preserving meaning, resulted in sentence structures that are too simple for the target audience. For example, the original complex sentence about the gene mutation was broken into three very short, declarative sentences. This choppiness is characteristic of an A2 text. Suggestion: To elevate the text to B1, combine some of the shorter sentences using appropriate connectors. For instance, 'This change seems to be connected with speaking, as it also relates to how our brains control our mouths and face.' The strategy of defining the keyword 'gene' was excellent, and the factual integrity was perfect. The primary area for improvement is increasing sentence complexity slightly to meet the B1 standard.",
