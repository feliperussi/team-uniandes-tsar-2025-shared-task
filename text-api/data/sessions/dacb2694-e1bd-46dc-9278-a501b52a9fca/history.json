While your text includes these elements, the initial definition of 'prophecy' and the simplification of phrases like 'more likely to be the result of coincidence' to 'often just by chance' dilute the original's argumentative tone and specific phrasing. Key phrases such as 'for example', 'more likely to be the result of', 'And, of course, we probably choose to', and 'all the times we dream about such events' were omitted, contributing to the low BERTScore.
