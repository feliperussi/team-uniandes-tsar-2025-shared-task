        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6114 is well below the required minimum of approximately 0.75, indicating severe loss of the original text's core message about complexity and cultural nuance in business communication. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8716 is below the required 0.90 threshold. Critical terms and phrasing such as 'nuances and expectations of business communication', 'unfair judgements', 'misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication', and 'business acquaintances' are oversimplified or omitted, compromising factual and lexical fidelity. Despite the CEFR classifier rating A2 as required, the substitution of 'communication' (a B1 word) with an unmet simpler alternative shows confusion in vocabulary levels. Moreover, the original stresses the risk of judgement and communication breakdowns due to cultural misunderstanding, but the rewrite reduces this to generic 'mistakes' and 'problems', failing to retain the warning tone and precision. Suggestion: Preserve the original's key points about cultural differences causing misunderstandings and unfair judgements. Use simpler words but keep the concepts of 'communication expectations', 'cultural norms', and 'business relationships'. Replace oversimplifications like 'business friends' with 'business people you work with'. Increase precision in describing risks caused by cultural differences.",
