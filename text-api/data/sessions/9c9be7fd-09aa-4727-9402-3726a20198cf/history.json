NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, they found about 8,000. This means there are still 17,000 to find. These asteroids are a big danger. In 2013, a small asteroid exploded over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a very serious problem if they come near Earth.",

While the replacement of 'injured' (B1) with 'hurt' (A2) was correct, this does not compensate for the new B1 vocabulary introduced. The text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary."

Complex concepts like 'exploded' and 'enter Earth's orbit' are perfectly simplified to 'broke into many pieces' and 'come near Earth'. The keyword 'asteroids' is defined immediately. Sentence structure is simple and clear. No errors found."
