The text uses it directly: 'This idea is against consumerism.' This is unacceptable for an A2 audience. 2. The word 'protests' is a B1 level word. The text uses it directly: 'On Buy Nothing Day, people do different protests.' This word must be simplified to A2 vocabulary.

The core message of the original text, which describes a dynamic 'trend' 'springing up in opposition' and a 'rejection' of overconsumption, has been diluted. The writer's output uses weaker phrasing such as 'A new idea is starting' instead of 'A different trend is springing up', and 'this idea was against buying too much' instead of 'rejection of the overspending and overconsumption'. These simplifications reduce the strength and nuance of the original's message about a counter-movement. The definition of 'consumerism' as 'when people buy too many things' is an acceptable A2 simplification, but it also contributes to the slight loss of the original's emphasis on 'overspending and overconsumption' as a broader societal issue. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to convey the idea of a strong counter-movement or trend. Use stronger verbs or adverbs to express the 'opposition' and 'rejection' more clearly, while remaining within A2 vocabulary. For example, 'A strong new idea is fighting against consumerism'.",

The primary reason for this failure is the inclusion of B1 vocabulary. The word 'trend' is explicitly listed as a B1 vocabulary candidate, and its presence elevates the text's complexity beyond A2. Similarly, the word 'spending' in the phrase 'spending too much money' is also identified as B1 vocabulary. A2 texts must strictly adhere to A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Replace 'trend' with simpler A2 phrases such as 'new idea' or 'new way'. Rephrase sentences to avoid B1 words like 'spending'; for example, 'using too much money' or 'buying too many things' could be used instead.",
