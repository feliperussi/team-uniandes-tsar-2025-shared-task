Your version simplifies this to 'People who build bridges know this. They make plans for bridges. They build them on strong ground.

The term 'structures' from the original is replaced by the less comprehensive 'buildings' and 'bridges.' The phrase 'relatively infrequent, especially with modern bridges' is simplified to 'do not fall down often' and 'new bridges fall down even less,' losing the precise meaning of 'relatively' and 'especially.' The word 'Engineers' is replaced by the less specific 'People who build bridges.' The concept of 'resistant to movement' is diluted to 'do not move much.'

The core message of the original text, which emphasizes engineers 'learning' to design more resistant structures and the progress in engineering solutions, is diluted. The writer's output introduces a definition of earthquakes not present in the original ('Earthquakes are when the ground shakes a lot') and shifts the focus from 'learning to design' to simply 'knowing' and 'planning', losing the nuance of engineering advancement. \n\nAdditionally, the text fails CEFR compliance. The CEFR classifier rated the text as 'B1', not 'A2'. This indicates the text is too complex for the A2 standard. Specific linguistic evidence for this B1 classification includes:\n- The use of 'when' as a defining relative adverb in 'Earthquakes are when the ground shakes a lot' is a B1 structure. An A2 simplification would be 'Earthquakes happen. The ground shakes a lot.'\n- The use of 'that' as a relative pronoun introducing a defining relative clause in 'ground that resists movement' is a B1 structure. An A2 simplification would be 'The ground resists movement. They build bridges on this ground.' or 'They build bridges on strong ground.'\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to directly address the damage and infrequency of collapse as in the original. Ensure the concept of engineers' 'learning' and 'improving design' is preserved. Eliminate relative clauses using 'when' or 'that' to simplify sentence structure to an A2 level.

The core message regarding the engineers' specific learning and application of that knowledge to design bridges in earthquake zones on resistant areas is significantly diluted. The original text emphasizes that engineers 'have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement,' directly linking this learned expertise to the infrequency of collapse. Your version, 'Engineers know about earthquakes. They design bridges for places with earthquakes. They make bridges resistant to movement. They build them on ground that does not move much,' fragments this crucial cause-and-effect relationship into a series of general statements. The nuance of 'learned to design' and the specific context of 'in earthquake zones' are lost, reducing the semantic similarity to the original's explanation of modern bridge safety. The text also failed the CEFR Compliance check. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This indicates that despite attempts at simplification, the overall linguistic complexity or structure is still above the A2 target. This could be due to the fragmented sentence structure which, while simple individually, creates a longer, less cohesive narrative that might be interpreted as more complex than intended for A2. Suggestion: Rephrase the section about engineers to clearly state that engineers learned how to build bridges better in places with earthquakes, specifically on strong ground, to make them safer. Ensure the connection between their learning and the safety of modern bridges is explicit and simple. Review sentence structures to ensure they are consistently A2, avoiding any implicit B1 complexity.",
