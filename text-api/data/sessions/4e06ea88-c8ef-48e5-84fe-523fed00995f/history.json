This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and narrative connection.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The text was broken into excessively simple, disconnected sentences. This destroyed the cause-and-effect relationships present in the original. For example, the original's clause 'When her younger sister... is chosen..., Katniss volunteers...' shows a direct reaction. Your version separates these into isolated facts, losing the meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8772 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a result of replacing precise, simple terms from the original ('mining accident', 'bow and arrow') with less accurate or more complex phrases ('digging accident', 'weapon for shooting arrows').\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: You introduced the B1 word 'weapon' and the B2 word 'shooting'. The original text used 'bow and arrow', which is composed of simple, A2-appropriate words. This was an unnecessary and incorrect substitution.\n\n- Content Error: The inclusion of '(Correction)' in the final sentence is a critical error. It is not part of the narrative and makes the text incoherent.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is too choppy. A2 requires simple sentences, not a list of disconnected statements. The flow of the story has been lost.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. Combine sentences to restore logical connections. Use the simple vocabulary from the original text where possible. Remove the word 'weapon'. Remove the erroneous '(Correction)' text. You must preserve the narrative, not just list the facts.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text establishes Katniss's core motivation with the phrase 'has to provide food for her family'. Your output completely omits this essential information, which fundamentally changes the character's context.\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8881 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of oversimplification. The term 'complicated relationship' was reduced to 'hard', which is a substantial loss of meaning. 'Complicated' implies mixed or confusing feelings, whereas 'hard' simply implies difficulty.\n- Factual Inaccuracy: You introduced a fact not present in the source material by adding 'District 12 is a poor area'. Adherence to the original text is absolute. Do not add information.\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. While A2 requires simplicity, this level of fragmentation makes the text choppy and unnatural.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts of the original text. You must include that Katniss needs to find food for her family. You must find a simple A2 way to explain a 'complicated' relationship, for example, 'her feelings for him are not simple'. Combine some of the very short sentences to improve flow, for example, 'She lives in District 12 and hunts in the woods with Gale'. Remove all information that was not in the original passage.",

This is a direct violation of the standard.\n*   Redundancy: The phrase 'difficult and not easy to understand' is repetitive. A2 level text must be simple and clear, not redundant.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentence to restore the original meaning. Use simple words to describe a complex situation.

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message, making it an instant failure.\n\n*   MeaningBERT Failure: The primary reason for failure is the severe degradation of meaning due to over-simplification. The concept 'mining accident' was broken into two disconnected sentences: 'Her father died in an accident. He worked under the ground.' This severs the direct causal link. Similarly, 'complicated relationship' was diluted into 'She has many different feelings for him. It is not simple.', which fails to capture the single, complex idea from the original.\n*   Fidelity Failure: The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8729 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing key vocabulary from the original, such as 'mining', 'skilful', and 'volunteers', which reduces lexical fidelity.\n*   Structural Fragmentation: While A2 requires simple sentences, this output is excessively fragmented. The series of short, disconnected statements makes the text choppy and damages the narrative flow, contributing to the low meaning score.\n*   CEFR Compliance: The text achieved an A2 classification, but it did so by sacrificing meaning and fidelity, which is an unacceptable trade-off.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine fragmented sentences to restore logical connections. Do not break single concepts into multiple, disconnected sentences. Restore the meaning of 'complicated relationship' with a single A2 sentence, such as 'Her feelings for him are not simple.'",

An A2 reader will not understand 'mining accident'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. Use simple connectors like 'and', 'but', and 'so' to link ideas and restore the story's logical flow. For example: 'Her father died in an accident at his work, so she must get food for her family.' Remove the redundant definition of District 12. Simplify the term 'mining accident'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary failure is on metric performance. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6983 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8885 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a critical loss of meaning and lexical fidelity from the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score is low because your simplifications, while grammatically correct, are too generic. The original text's concept of a 'mining accident' is more specific and meaningful than 'accident at his work'. The phrase 'a tool that shoots arrows' is a vague and clumsy replacement for 'bow and arrow', which damages the clarity of the original message.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: This score is low because key lexical items were removed and replaced with overly simple terms. The loss of words like 'mining', 'skilful', and 'bow and arrow' directly caused this metric to fail.\n\n- Structural Issues: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure further contributes to the loss of meaning and flow, even though it technically uses A2 grammar.\n\n- Keyword Handling: The definition for 'tribute' is acceptable. However, 'District 12' is used without a clear definition of what a 'District' is.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key factual details like 'mining' to preserve meaning. Rephrase the description of the weapon; 'a bow and arrow' is understandable at A2 and preferable to the generic 'tool'. Combine some of the short sentences to create a more natural flow, for example: 'She lives in District 12 and hunts in the woods with her friend Gale.'",
