    "feedback": "FAIL: Deep Qualitative Audit Failure. The text passes factual, meaning, and CEFR classifier checks but breaks A2 vocabulary and structure rules.\n- Vocabulary Audit: uses B2-level words gene and mutation; B1-level word connection; non-A2 words monkeys, speaking, DNA, which.\n- Structural Analysis: contains a long sentence with a relative clause starting with which; uses complex grammar instead of only and, but, so, because.\nSuggestion: Replace gene/mutation/connection with simpler terms like part/change/link. Remove which-clauses by splitting into two sentences. Avoid uncommon words like monkeys, DNA, speaking; use simpler synonyms. Ensure all sentences use only and, but, so, or because as connectors.",
