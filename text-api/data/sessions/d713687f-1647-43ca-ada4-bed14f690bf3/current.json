    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states one idea is that dreams represent things 'hidden from our conscious mind'. Your text states 'dream pictures show the part of your mind that is awake'. This is the opposite of the original meaning and a complete failure of comprehension.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8947 is below the required 0.90. This metric correctly identified that your text lost key lexical details from the original, such as 'conscious mind' and 'random activity'.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, exceeding the A2 target. The sentence 'Freud was a doctor who studied the mind' uses a relative clause ('who studied'), which is a B1-level grammatical structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'hidden' is classified as B1 and was used without simplification. The word 'doctor' is also listed as B1. Unapproved B1 vocabulary is forbidden.\n\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text to correct the severe factual error regarding the first theory of dreams. The concept is about the hidden, unconscious mind, not the awake mind. Remove the B1 vocabulary. Break the sentence about Freud into two simple A2 sentences to eliminate the B1 relative clause. Example: 'Freud was a doctor. He studied the mind.'",
