This is a B1-level grammatical structure and is not permitted.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is overly fragmented. The sequence 'The brain does this. It sorts memories. It also sorts events from the day.' is unnaturally choppy. A2 level requires simple, complete sentences, not a series of disconnected phrases.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence with the B1 structure. Use two simple sentences connected by a time word.

While simplification is necessary, the loss of lexical fidelity is too great. Furthermore, the text fails a qualitative vocabulary audit. Multiple words exceed the A2 CEFR level.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'hidden' is B1. It must be replaced with an A2 equivalent, such as 'that we do not know about'.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'collection' is B1. It must be replaced with a simpler A2 term like 'a group'.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'random' is B2. This is a severe deviation from the A2 standard. It must be rephrased using A2 vocabulary, for example, 'activity with no reason' or 'activity without a pattern'.\n- Fidelity Loss: The phrase 'conscious mind' was reduced to 'mind'. This simplification contributed to the low BERTScore by losing a key term.\n\nSuggestion: Adhere strictly to A2 vocabulary lists. Replace all identified B1 and B2 words. Re-evaluate simplifications to ensure key terms are preserved where possible or defined with extreme simplicity.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text due to oversimplification. The core meaning was mostly kept, but the lexical fidelity was compromised.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The phrase 'conscious mind' was replaced with 'part of your mind you know'. This is lexically distant and grammatically awkward for A2.\n- The B1-level verb 'represent' was simplified to 'show', losing precision.\n- The concept of 'random activity' was simplified to 'activity with no reason'. While similar in meaning, it loses the specific vocabulary of the original, contributing to the low fidelity score.\n- The original's causal link '...understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause' was weakened to two separate sentences: 'He said we can learn about feelings we do not know about. Dreams can help us see our problems.'\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to re-introduce more precise A2-level vocabulary that is closer to the original. For 'conscious mind', use a phrase like 'the part of your mind that is awake'. For 'random activity', a phrase like 'brain activity that is not planned' would be more faithful. Sentences must be simple, but vocabulary choices must not be so simplified that they damage fidelity to the source text.",

This metric correctly identified that your text lost key lexical details from the original, such as 'conscious mind' and 'random activity'.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, exceeding the A2 target. The sentence 'Freud was a doctor who studied the mind' uses a relative clause ('who studied'), which is a B1-level grammatical structure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'hidden' is classified as B1 and was used without simplification. The word 'doctor' is also listed as B1. Unapproved B1 vocabulary is forbidden.\n\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text to correct the severe factual error regarding the first theory of dreams. The concept is about the hidden, unconscious mind, not the awake mind. Remove the B1 vocabulary. Break the sentence about Freud into two simple A2 sentences to eliminate the B1 relative clause.
