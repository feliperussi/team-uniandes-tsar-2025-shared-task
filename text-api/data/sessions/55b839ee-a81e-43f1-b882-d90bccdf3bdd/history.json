She saw a foreign child playing with it in her home country, Bangladesh. Wasfia watched, but she didn't want to, because people in her country believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is one of only a few people in the world who have climbed the seven highest mountains, for example, Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to use a hula hoop on each of these mountains. She did this to help women and girls in her country feel stronger, because her country does not encourage them to do sport.",

While the text successfully preserves factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.7644, BERTScore: 0.9432), the simplification has resulted in a text that is too basic for a B1 learner. This is evident in the consistent use of simple sentence structures and A2-level vocabulary and connectors. For example, 'Wasfia watched, but she didn't want to' is a very simple rendering of 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched'. Similarly, 'help women and girls in her country feel stronger' is a significant simplification of 'empower women and girls', reducing the vocabulary complexity. Connectors used are primarily A2 level ('but', 'because'). To achieve a B1 level, introduce a greater variety of sentence structures, including more B1-level subordinating conjunctions and relative clauses. Consider retaining or introducing slightly more sophisticated B1 vocabulary where appropriate, rather than always opting for the simplest A2 equivalent.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the length and complexity of certain sentences and the retention of higher-level vocabulary. For example, the sentence 'Now, Wasfia is one of the few people in the world who have climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro, and the first to have hula-hooped on each peak' contains multiple embedded clauses and advanced grammatical structures like perfect infinitives ('to have climbed', 'to have hula-hooped') which are typically B2 or higher. While the definition of 'hula hoop' was correctly provided, its integration into the first sentence makes that sentence quite long and complex for B1. Furthermore, the word 'empower' (listed as C1 in the Vocabulary Candidates) was retained without simplification, contributing to the higher complexity. To achieve B1, consider splitting longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones, especially those with multiple clauses. For instance, the sentence about Wasfia's achievements could be broken into two or three sentences. Also, simplify or define higher-level vocabulary like 'empower' to ensure it aligns with the B1 target.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.7687) and BERTScore (0.9637) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer effectively simplified complex sentence structures from the original, such as splitting the opening sentence and the one about the Seven Summits into multiple, more accessible B1-level sentences. The keyword 'hula hoop' was accurately and clearly defined, which is crucial for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the higher-level vocabulary word 'empower' was skillfully replaced with the B1-appropriate phrase 'give women and girls more confidence and strength', maintaining the original intent while simplifying the language. The overall flow and structure are coherent and easy to follow. This is a very strong simplification.",
