    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an event that happens every year, which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for fighting against the government. Every year, one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 are chosen from each district by lottery to compete in a battle where only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\", which are the people selected to fight in the games. The whole country is forced to watch the event on TV.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that meets all requirements. The output passes all high-priority checks: Factual Integrity is perfect, Meaning Preservation is excellent (MeaningBERT score of 0.86 is well above the 0.75 threshold), and the text correctly classifies at the target B1 level. The vocabulary strategy was executed perfectly; 'rebelling' was simplified to the more accessible 'fighting against the government', and the keyword 'tributes' was defined clearly and naturally within the flow of the text. This is a model submission.",
