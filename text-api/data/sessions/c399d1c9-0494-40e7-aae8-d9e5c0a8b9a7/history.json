        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The primary reason for failure is that the output text was classified as 'A2', which is below the target B1 level. While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning (confirmed by a high MeaningBERT score of 0.859), it has been over-simplified. The vocabulary and sentence structures are not complex enough to meet the B1 standard. For example, the final sentence is long but structurally simple, combining two clauses with 'and'. To reach the B1 target, consider introducing more sentence variety. Suggestion: Split the final sentence for better clarity and flow, like this: 'The chosen teenagers are called \"tributes\", which are the people selected to fight in the games. The whole country is forced to watch the event on TV.' This demonstrates better control over sentence structure, a key B1 skill."

The output passes all high-priority checks: Factual Integrity is perfect, Meaning Preservation is excellent (MeaningBERT score of 0.86 is well above the 0.75 threshold), and the text correctly classifies at the target B1 level. The vocabulary strategy was executed perfectly; 'rebelling' was simplified to the more accessible 'fighting against the government', and the keyword 'tributes' was defined clearly and naturally within the flow of the text. This is a model submission."
