It must be replaced with a simpler A2 word.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is excessively fragmented. The complete lack of simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' makes the text unnatural and contributes to the loss of meaning between sentences.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to connect the sentences and restore the cause-and-effect relationship. Replace the word 'impact' with 'hit'. Restore the full name of the DART test in the definition to improve fidelity.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text states a direct cause and effect: 'the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit'. Your version weakens this to 'The test will try to knock Didymoon out of its orbit'. The introduction of 'try' fundamentally changes the meaning from a planned outcome to a mere attempt.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8888 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is due to the replacement of specific terms like 'impact' with the generic word 'test', and 'pick up' with 'see', losing lexical precision.\n\n- Structural Weakness: While breaking down complex sentences is a valid A2 strategy, here it has damaged the meaning. The original sentence connects the impact, the orbit change, and the observation into a single causal chain. Your version separates these into disconnected facts, losing the logical flow.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Remove the word 'try'. Rephrase to create a clear cause-and-effect relationship. Example: 'The DART test will hit Didymoon. This hit will knock it from its orbit. Scientists hope telescopes on Earth can see this change.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on multiple high-priority checks. The primary failure is the inability to preserve the core meaning and fidelity of the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.651 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8692 is also below the 0.90 minimum. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.651): The original text states the goal is to 'knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up'. Your version simplifies this to 'change a small space rock' and 'see the change'. This is too vague and loses the specific scientific concepts of redirection and observation, which are central to the original message.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8692): Key lexical items from the original text were lost. The full name 'Double Asteroid Redirection Test' was removed, and the specific word 'impact' was replaced with the generic 'hit', reducing fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (Classifier: B1): The text was classified as B1, which is too complex. The sentence 'Scientists hope Earth telescopes can see the change' uses an implied 'that-clause' ('hope that...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. State that the test is to 'move' or 'push' the moon, not just 'change' it. Rephrase the final sentence to remove the B1 structure. Example: 'Scientists will use telescopes on Earth. They want to see the moon move.'",
