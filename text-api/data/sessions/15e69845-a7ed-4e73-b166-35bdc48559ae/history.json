They also need to say \"good job\" more often for their work. The company should spend more money on training for workers. This training can help them talk with other people better. This will help make a good place to work. Then, employees can do their best work.",

        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text uses B1 vocabulary such as 'manages', 'Managers', and 'focus'. This is a direct violation of the A2-only rule. The first sentence, 'Because of what we found, we think Girox Foods should change how it manages people,' is structurally too complex for A2, using multiple clauses. The simplification of 'social and intercultural communication' to 'talk with other people better' is factually imprecise as it omits the 'intercultural' aspect."
