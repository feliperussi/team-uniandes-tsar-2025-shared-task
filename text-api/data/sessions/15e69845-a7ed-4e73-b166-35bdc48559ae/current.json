    "text_translated": "We learned some things. So, we think Girox Foods needs a new way to lead its workers. Leaders should think more about the workers. The company should give workers hours that can change. Workers should also be able to work from home or other places. Leaders need to give workers interesting things to do. They should also say \"good job\" more often. The company should pay for more training for workers. This training helps them talk to people from different countries and cultures. This will make the company a good place to work. Then, workers can do their best work.",
