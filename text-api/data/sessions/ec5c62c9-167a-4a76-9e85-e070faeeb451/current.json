More wild animals are coming into cities. For example, people have seen bears in Vancouver parks. They have also seen large wild cats on the streets of Mumbai. Wild pigs have appeared in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Do people welcome them, or do they see them as a danger or a problem?",
