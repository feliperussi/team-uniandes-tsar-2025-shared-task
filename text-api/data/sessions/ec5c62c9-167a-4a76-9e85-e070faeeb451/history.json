        "feedback_text": "The text fails on multiple B1 criteria. Sentences 2 and 3 ('But in recent years...', 'There have been bears...') are over 20 words long, which is unacceptable for B1 clarity. The word 'leopards' is B2 level and is not defined as a keyword, violating the vocabulary rule. The repeated use of the present perfect tense in these long sentences creates a grammatical structure that is too complex for a B1 learner."
