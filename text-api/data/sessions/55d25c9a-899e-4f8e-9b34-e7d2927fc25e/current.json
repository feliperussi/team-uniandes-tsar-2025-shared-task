    "text_translated": "It is helpful to know that people from different cultures can act in different ways. This can help us avoid problems when we communicate. However, we must remember that using stereotypes is bad for business relationships. Stereotypes are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like.\n\nA country's culture can change how we think and act. But many other things also affect how we behave. The area we are from and the groups we are part of are important. Our age and if we are a man or a woman also matter. Our company culture and our own life experiences are important too. So, we should know about these possible differences. But we should not use this information to judge every person from a whole country.",
