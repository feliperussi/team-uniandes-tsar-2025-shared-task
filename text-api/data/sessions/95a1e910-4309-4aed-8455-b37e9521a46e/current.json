    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6516 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is a critical failure. It indicates a severe deviation from the core message of the original text. The fundamental meaning has been lost or distorted during the simplification process. While the text passes the BERTScore for lexical fidelity and the CEFR classifier for readability, it does not accurately represent the information from the source material. Suggestion: Re-evaluate the original text to identify the central message. Rewrite the output to ensure this core meaning is preserved using A2-level phrasing.",
