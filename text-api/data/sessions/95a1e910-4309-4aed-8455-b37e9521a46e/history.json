This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The original text states we \"choose to forget\" dreams that do not come true. Your version states \"we forget many dreams\". This removes the concept of selective memory, which is a critical part of the original's meaning.\n- The original specifies the death of \"someone close\". Your version uses \"someone you know\", which is a less specific and less impactful concept, altering the original's emotional context.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.9048 is acceptable, the loss of these key concepts is too severe for the text to be considered a faithful A2 simplification.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. The concept of 'choice' is essential. Change 'we forget many dreams' to a phrase like 'We choose to forget the dreams that do not happen.'

The core concepts of dreams as coincidence and the act of forgetting unfulfilled dream events are perfectly preserved.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within acceptable parameters. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8339 and BERTScore of 0.9187 confirm high fidelity to the source material.\n- CEFR Classification: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. The vocabulary is strictly controlled, using only A1 and A2 words. The original complex sentence structure has been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences connected by basic A2 conjunctions ('or', 'but'). The output is clear, direct, and perfectly aligned with the target proficiency level. No deviations were found."

This indicates the core message of the original text was not accurately preserved. This is an instant failure.\n\nAdditional Violations Detected:\n\nVocabulary Violation: The word 'coincidence' is B2 level. It must be removed. The phrase 'they happen by chance' is a sufficient A2 replacement on its own.\n\nStructural Complexity: The first sentence uses a 'that-clause' ('...or that someone close to you dies'), which is a B1 grammatical structure. This is too advanced for A2.\n\nStructural Complexity: The sentences 'We forget all the times we have these dreams...' and 'We only remember the times they do happen' use implied relative clauses, which are too complex for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the original meaning. Remove the word 'coincidence'. Split the first sentence into two separate, simple sentences. Rephrase the final two sentences to be more direct, for example: 'We forget when the dreams do not happen. We only remember when they do.'"
