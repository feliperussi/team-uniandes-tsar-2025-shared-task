Complex concepts like 'people-oriented management', 'positive reinforcement', and 'intercultural communication' were simplified into concrete, easily understandable A2 actions ('change how it manages people', 'say \"good job\"', 'talk with different people') without losing factual accuracy. All sentence structures are simple and declarative. Vocabulary is exclusively within the A1/A2 range. This is a model A2 text."
