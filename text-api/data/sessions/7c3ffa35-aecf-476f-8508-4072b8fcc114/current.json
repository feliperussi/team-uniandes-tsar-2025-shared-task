    "text_translated": "Because of what we found, we think Girox Foods should change how it manages people. We should let workers choose when they start and finish work. We should also let them work from places they choose. Managers need to give workers interesting tasks. They also need to say \"good job\" for the work they do. We should spend more money on training for workers. This training can help them talk with different people. This will help make a good place to work, so employees can do their best work.",

    "feedback": "Flawless execution. The text adheres strictly to A2 standards. Complex concepts like 'people-oriented management', 'positive reinforcement', and 'intercultural communication' were simplified into concrete, easily understandable A2 actions ('change how it manages people', 'say \"good job\"', 'talk with different people') without losing factual accuracy. All sentence structures are simple and declarative. Vocabulary is exclusively within the A1/A2 range. This is a model A2 text.",
