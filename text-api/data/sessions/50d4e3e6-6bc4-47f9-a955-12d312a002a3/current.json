    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text.\n- Metrics Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.83) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids all B1 complexity.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. Complex sentence structures from the original text, such as those using 'While' and 'Although', have been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level. The simplification of concepts like 'legitimate art form' to 'real art' is precise and effective. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
