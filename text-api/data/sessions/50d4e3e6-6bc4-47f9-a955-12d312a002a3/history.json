No B1+ words were used.\n- Structural Simplicity: Complex sentences from the original, such as those using 'while' and 'although', were correctly broken down into short, simple sentences connected by basic conjunctions like 'but'.

The text avoids all B1 complexity.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range. Complex sentence structures from the original text, such as those using 'While' and 'Although', have been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level. The simplification of concepts like 'legitimate art form' to 'real art' is precise and effective. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
