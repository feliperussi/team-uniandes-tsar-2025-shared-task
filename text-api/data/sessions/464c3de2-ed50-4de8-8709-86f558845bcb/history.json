        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. While the simplification successfully maintained factual integrity (MeaningBERT: 0.919, BERTScore: 0.9627), the vocabulary and sentence structures were simplified beyond the B1 target, resulting in an A2 classification. For example, the original phrase 'the house filled up with the evening sounds of chatter, television or her dad listening to his beloved jazz' was simplified. While splitting the sentence was a good strategy for B1, replacing 'chatter' (a B1-appropriate word) with 'people talking' and 'beloved jazz' with 'favourite jazz music' pushed the vocabulary to an A2 level. Similarly, 'arrived home' was simplified to 'came home', and 'that could wait for later' to 'she decided to do it later', both of which are simpler than necessary for a B1 target. To achieve a B1 level, focus on simplifying complex sentence structures while retaining B1-appropriate vocabulary where possible, or replacing it with other B1 synonyms rather than A2 equivalents.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. Meaning preservation is excellent, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.9453, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original text's key information is also very high, with a BERTScore of 0.9825, exceeding the 0.90 requirement. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively simplified the original's long third sentence by splitting it into two, which significantly improves readability and flow for a B1 learner without losing any information. This is a strong simplification strategy. The vocabulary choices are generally appropriate. However, the word 'beloved' was identified as a C1 candidate but was retained. While the overall text remains B1, for maximum accessibility, consider replacing 'beloved' with a more B1-friendly synonym such as 'favourite' or 'much-loved' in future simplifications. Overall, this is a very well-executed simplification.",
