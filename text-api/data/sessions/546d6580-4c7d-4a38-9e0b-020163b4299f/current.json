    "text_translated": "Religion, which is a system of faith and worship, is very important to Pi. Although his family follows Hinduism, Pi shows interest in other faiths, which leads him to make friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. To everyone's surprise, Pi declares himself to be Hindu, Muslim, and Christian at the same time. When his family and teachers ask him to choose only one religion, Pi refuses, saying, 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him make his own mind up about religion.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8875 and BERTScore of 0.9697 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text's content and key phrasing. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating successful adherence to the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. The definition of 'religion' ('which is a system of faith and worship') is a strong addition, providing clarity for a B1 audience. Vocabulary simplifications, such as changing 'simultaneously' to 'at the same time' and 'is Hindu' to 'follows Hinduism', are well-executed and appropriate for the B1 level without losing nuance. The overall structure and flow are natural, using appropriate B1 connectors. This is an exemplary simplification.",
