While the addition of the definition for 'religion' is appropriate for B1, several other simplifications reduced the overall complexity of the text too much. For example, the original phrase 'Pi declares himself to be simultaneously Hindu, Muslim and Christian' was simplified to 'Pi says that he is Hindu, Muslim, and Christian at the same time', which uses simpler vocabulary and sentence structure. Similarly, 'Pi refuses, saying' was changed to 'Pi says no, because', and the B1 idiom 'make his own mind up' was simplified to the A2 phrase 'decide for himself'. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to incorporate more B1 vocabulary and sentence structures, while still maintaining clarity. Consider retaining some of the original B1 phrasing or introducing other B1-level synonyms and grammatical constructions.",

The primary reason for this classification is the explicit definition of 'religion' in the first sentence: 'Religion, which is a system of beliefs about God or gods, is very important to Pi.' While providing definitions can be helpful, this particular explanation is characteristic of an A2-level text introducing a basic concept. For a B1 target, the text should generally assume a foundational understanding of common terms like 'religion' or integrate explanations more subtly. To achieve a B1 classification, consider removing this explicit definition or rephrasing it to be less elementary, allowing the reader to infer the meaning from context or assuming a basic understanding.",

The original text was already quite simple, and the changes made did not sufficiently increase the linguistic complexity to meet the B1 target. For instance, changing the direct speech 'I just want to love God' to indirect speech 'saying that he just wants to love God' is a common simplification technique that can move text towards a lower CEFR level. While the C1 word 'simultaneously' was retained, the overall sentence structures and vocabulary choices remained very accessible, leading to the A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider introducing slightly more varied sentence structures, using a wider range of B1 vocabulary (while still defining keywords), or employing more complex B1 connectors where appropriate, without sacrificing clarity or factual integrity. For example, the sentence 'Even though his family is Hindu, he is curious about other religions, and he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker' could potentially be rephrased to incorporate a slightly more complex B1 structure, or a B1 vocabulary word could replace a simpler one if context allows.",

While the output successfully defined the B1 keyword 'religion' ('Religion, which is a system of faith and worship...') and introduced some B1 structures like the relative clause in 'which leads him to form friendships with', the overall linguistic profile remains closer to A2. Specifically, many A1/A2 vocabulary items from the original text were retained without simplification or replacement, such as 'great', 'love', 'want', and 'decide'. Additionally, the C1 word 'simultaneously' was kept, which, while not making it A2, is a missed opportunity to simplify vocabulary to the B1 level. To achieve a B1 classification, the text needs a more consistent density of B1 vocabulary and more varied sentence structures throughout, rather than just in the opening sentences. Suggestion: Consider replacing more A1/A2 vocabulary candidates with B1 synonyms, simplifying complex words like 'simultaneously' (e.g., 'at the same time'), and introducing more B1-level conjunctions or sentence structures in the latter part of the text.",

While the writer successfully defined the keyword 'religion' ('which is a system of faith and worship'), several vocabulary choices increased the overall complexity of the text. For instance, the phrase 'holds considerable importance' is more complex than a B1 equivalent like 'is very important'. The word 'curiosity' (C1 according to the provided candidates) could be simplified to 'interest' or 'wants to know about'. 'Astonishment' is a B2/C1 word; the original 'surprise' is more appropriate for B1. Similarly, 'stating' is more formal than 'saying' (A1). Finally, the phrase 'I simply wish to care for God' changes the nuance from the original 'I just want to love God'. 'Love God' is a more common and direct expression at the B1 level, and 'care for God' can sound unnatural or imply a different meaning. To achieve B1, focus on using simpler synonyms and more direct phrasing, especially for common expressions, and avoid vocabulary that pushes the text into a higher CEFR band.",
