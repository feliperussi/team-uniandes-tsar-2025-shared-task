The protocol requires strict adherence to the A2 word list. Any B1-level word is an automatic failure. While the text successfully passes all factual and metric checks, including meaning preservation and structural simplicity, this single vocabulary violation is non-negotiable. Suggestion: Replace '90 percent' with an A2-level phrase. Use '90 of every 100' or 'most of' to conform to the standard.",

This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The original text states NASA 'identified and logged' the objects. Your version uses 'looked for' and 'found', which is a less precise simplification and reduces lexical overlap.\n- The original states 'none of the 887... are a significant danger'. Your version, 'these 887 asteroids are not a big danger', changes the sentence structure and loses the emphasis of 'none'.\n- The phrase '90 per cent' was changed to '90 of every 100'. While factually correct, this change contributes to the drop in the fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the 0.90 BERTScore requirement, align your phrasing more closely with the source. Change 'looked for' to a more direct A2 equivalent of 'logged', such as 'found and made a list of'. Rephrase to better capture the meaning of 'none are a danger'.",

MeaningBERT at 0.839 and BERTScore at 0.9077 confirm that the core meaning and key terms have been preserved with high fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms this.\n- Vocabulary: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. All words used are appropriate for the target audience.\n- Structure: Sentence structure is exemplary. The use of short, simple sentences ensures maximum readability for an A2 learner. The keyword 'near-Earth objects' is defined clearly and simply within the text. No deviations detected.",
