    "text_translated": "We have more questions about how genes affect the brain and language. A gene is a part of your body that you get from your parents. It controls things like your hair color. Did a change in our genes give us the ability to speak? Scientists found a gene that changed between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected to speaking. It also seems connected to how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but their gene did not change in this way. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. But one day, we might find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text demonstrates a strong ability to write simple, connected text on a familiar topic. The structure is clear, using a good mix of simple sentences and compound sentences linked with connectors like 'that' and 'but'. For example, 'A gene is a part of your body that you get from your parents' is a well-formed sentence that clearly links two ideas. Your vocabulary management is a model for this level; you correctly identified the B2 word 'gene' as a keyword and provided a simple, effective definition using core vocabulary. This shows a strong communicative competence. The text is factually accurate and successfully conveys all the key information from the original.",
