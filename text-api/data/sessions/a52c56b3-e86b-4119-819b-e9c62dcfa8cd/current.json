    "feedback": "PASS. The output demonstrates complete adherence to the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: All data, including the 7.5 million kilometres distance, the 1,400 mapped asteroids, and the 100-year timeframe, is factually correct.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8409 and BERTScore of 0.9071 exceed the minimum thresholds. The CEFR classifier result is correctly A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. The B2 word 'potentially' was correctly identified and removed. The keyword 'Asteroids' was defined using simple A2 vocabulary.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is composed of short, simple sentences. Complex ideas from the original, such as 'defence solutions could be launched', have been successfully simplified to 'send two things into space to stop it'. The structure is exemplary for the A2 level.",
