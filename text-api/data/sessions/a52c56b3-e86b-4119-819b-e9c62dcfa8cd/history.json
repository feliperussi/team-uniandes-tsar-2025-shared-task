This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Factual Inaccuracy: The original text defines 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' with a specific, critical fact: they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. Your output omits this number entirely, replacing it with the vague phrase 'very near'. This is an unacceptable loss of factual integrity.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8988 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing key factual terms like 'orbit', 'threat', and 'defence solutions' with overly simple words, losing lexical precision.\n- Meaning Loss: The text fails to convey the scientific definition provided in the source. The primary purpose of the original text was to define a specific category of asteroid, which your version failed to do.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the core factual information. Re-introduce the 7.5 million kilometre distance. It is possible to state this fact in simple A2 terms. Example: 'These asteroids can come very close to Earth, less than 7.5 million kilometres away.' Do not remove essential numbers or definitions.",

Your version simplifies this into vague, general statements like 'Some asteroids are dangerous' and 'ways to stop it'. This simplification loses the core definitional meaning and technical nuance of the source material.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is classified as B2 level. It must be replaced. The sentence 'This means less than 7.5 million kilometres away' is not A2 compliant.\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'If a rock is going to hit the Earth, NASA has two ways to stop it' uses a first conditional structure ('if' clause), which is a B1 grammatical form. A2 level requires simpler, declarative sentences.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the definitional tone from the original text. Rephrase the explanation of distance to avoid the word 'means'.
