    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6359 is significantly below the required 0.75. While the factual information is present, the core message and emotional nuance of the original text have been altered. The original text emphasizes 'endurance' and being 'overcome' by circumstances ('live through hunger, illness and exhaustion', 'endure violent storms', 'overcome with loneliness and despair', 'somehow they survive'). Your version repeatedly uses the verb 'fight' ('They fight hunger. They fight illness.', 'They fight hard to stay alive', 'He cannot fight these feelings'). This shifts the meaning from a more passive, almost miraculous survival and being overwhelmed by emotions to an active, continuous struggle. This change in emphasis fundamentally alters the intended meaning and tone of the original narrative. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to better convey the sense of enduring or being affected by challenges, rather than actively fighting them. For example, instead of 'They fight hunger', consider 'They feel hunger' or 'They suffer from hunger'. Instead of 'He cannot fight these feelings', consider 'These feelings are too strong for him' or 'He feels very sad and alone and cannot stop these feelings'.",
