    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8831 is below the required 0.90. Key terms have been lost or simplified: the original word \"prophecy\" has been replaced by \"sign\" and the phrase \"result of coincidence\" is reduced to just \"chance,\" which removes important lexical detail. Suggestion: Restore the term \"prophecy\" and include the phrase \"result of coincidence\" or similar wording to match the original more closely.",
