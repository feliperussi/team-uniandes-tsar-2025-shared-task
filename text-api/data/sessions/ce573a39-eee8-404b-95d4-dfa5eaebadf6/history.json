It states a condition but fails to capture the negative emotional tone which is central to the original's meaning.\n- The simplification has removed the feeling of being unfairly treated, which is a critical component of the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the sense of a negative outcome.

This confirms that the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids B1 structures and vocabulary.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. Complex concepts like 'parental leave', 'negotiating', and 'pro-rata basis' were correctly simplified or removed. Sentence structure is exemplary, breaking down the original's longer sentences into short, simple statements linked by appropriate A2 connectors ('So', 'But', 'And').

The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: Vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structures are simple, short, and use appropriate A2 connectors like 'so', 'but', and 'and'. The simplification of complex concepts like 'parental leave' and 'negotiating' is executed correctly for the target level. No deviations were found."
