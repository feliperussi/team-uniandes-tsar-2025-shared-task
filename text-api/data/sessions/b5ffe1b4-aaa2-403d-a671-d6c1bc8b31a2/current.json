    "text_translated": "Evidence from between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, such as cave paintings, shows that early humans became more complex and intelligent. Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but they did develop. However, no one knows the connection between this and language. This leads to an important question: did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start to produce language?",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text is well-structured and demonstrates a strong ability to create connected text. You have successfully used connectors like 'such as', 'but', and 'However' to link ideas logically. The rephrasing of the final two questions into a single introductory sentence ('This leads to an important question:') is a particularly strong feature. The vocabulary is appropriate for the B1 level, and all key information from the original text has been accurately preserved.",
