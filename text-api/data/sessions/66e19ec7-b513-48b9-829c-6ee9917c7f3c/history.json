The MeaningBERT score of 0.8254 and BERTScore of 0.9157 confirm that the core message and key terms were successfully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly adheres to the A2 standard, as confirmed by the A2 classifier result.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. The simplification of 'resourceful' to 'cleverest' is an appropriate A2-level substitution.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences. The use of connectors is correctly limited to 'and' and 'but'. The text is a model of A2 structural requirements.",

The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1 and A2 levels.
