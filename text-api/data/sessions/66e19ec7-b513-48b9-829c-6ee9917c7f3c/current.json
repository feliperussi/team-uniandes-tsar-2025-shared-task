    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and preserves the core message of the original text.\n- Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8254 and BERTScore of 0.9183 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent meaning and fidelity preservation. The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structures are short, simple, and use only basic connectors like 'and' and 'but'. The simplification of 'resourceful' to 'cleverest' is an effective A2-level adaptation. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",
