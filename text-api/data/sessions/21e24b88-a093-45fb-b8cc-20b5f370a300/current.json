    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Now NASA is trying to find smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or bigger. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. Until now, they found about 8,000. So, 17,000 are still not on their list. In 2013, a small asteroid broke into many pieces over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these middle-sized asteroids are a serious danger if they come near Earth.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. It maintains perfect factual accuracy while simplifying complex concepts. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range, and the keyword 'asteroids' is clearly defined. Sentence structures are simple, using present simple, past simple, and a correct first conditional, all appropriate for the A2 level. The simplifications of 'exploded' to 'broke into many pieces' and 'unaccounted for' to 'not on their list' are excellent.",
