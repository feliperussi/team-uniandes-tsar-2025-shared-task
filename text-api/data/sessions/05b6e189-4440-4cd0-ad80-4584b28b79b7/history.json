This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The primary reason for this failure is the dilution of key concepts. For example, the original text states 'shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel', which conveys a specific moral and ethical objection. Your version simplifies this to 'They did not like shooting pigs. They said it was very bad.' This simplification loses the specific reason for the complaint (cruelty) and weakens the emotional and ethical context of the protests. Additionally, 'Many city residents' was generalized to 'A lot of people live in Berlin', which loses the specific group of complainants (residents affected by the issue). The text also fails to fully capture the 'heated arguments' by simply stating 'argued a lot', which is less intense. The overall impact is a less precise and less emotionally resonant retelling of the original events. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly include the concept of 'cruelty' as the reason for the complaint. Ensure the specific group of 'residents' is maintained. Use stronger language to convey the intensity of the arguments.",

This loses the sense of an ongoing, difficult challenge. The direct causal link 'In response to protests' is softened to 'People were angry. So, the city government made a new plan.', which reduces the clarity of why the action was taken. The intensity of the complaints and arguments, described as 'unnecessarily cruel' and 'heated arguments', is somewhat diluted by breaking them into very short, separate sentences like 'They said it was cruel' and 'Hunters and animal lovers argued a lot. These arguments were very strong.' The original's flow and emphasis on the interconnectedness of these issues are lost.

While individual facts are present, the overall semantic coherence and nuance of the original message have been diminished. For example, the original text's integrated clause 'though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past' is broken into several distinct sentences, and an explicit concluding sentence 'This makes the plan very hard to win' is added. This fragmentation and explicit restatement alter the original's subtle flow and emphasis, leading to a loss of the intended semantic relationship between the ideas. The term 'protests' in the original, implying organized action, is also softened to 'complained', which loses some of the original's context regarding the city's response. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain the original's integrated cause-and-effect relationships and the specific nuance of terms like 'protests' more closely, even while simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6693 is below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. While all factual points are present, the semantic nuance and specific emphasis of the original text have been diluted. For example, the original's 'unnecessarily cruel' is a single, strong concept, but your version splits it into 'not kind' and 'not necessary', which weakens the specific moral judgment. Similarly, 'heated arguments' is a more specific description than 'argued a lot. They were very angry.' The original's specific entities like 'city residents' and 'city council' are generalized to 'people' and 'city government', losing precision. The strong causal link in 'warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater' is broken into multiple, less semantically dense sentences. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific semantic weight of key phrases. For instance, combine 'not kind' and 'not necessary' into a single, stronger A2-appropriate phrase that conveys the original's 'unnecessarily cruel'. Ensure that specific actors like 'city residents' and 'city council' are maintained if possible, or replaced with equally specific A2 terms.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7191 is below the required 0.75. While the text is simplified to A2, it subtly alters the core meaning and impact of several key phrases from the original. This indicates a failure to fully convey the original message despite lexical fidelity. Specific deviations are listed below.  - The original phrase 'complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel' is rephrased as 'were angry. They said shooting pigs was too cruel. It was not needed.' This breaks down a single, strong concept into multiple sentences, diluting the specific nuance of 'unnecessarily' and the formal act of 'complaining'.  - The original 'decided to take more peaceful action' is rendered as 'made a new plan. They wanted a more peaceful way to stop the pigs.' The original implies a firm decision and direct action, whereas the rewrite suggests an intention or a preliminary step ('wanted a way'), which is less definitive.  - The word 'strategy' from the original, which implies a well-thought-out, long-term approach, is replaced with the simpler 'plan'. While 'plan' is A2, it loses the strategic depth of the original.  - The idiomatic expression 'losing battle' is replaced with 'fight they cannot win'. While understandable, the original idiom carries a stronger, more concise sense of inevitable defeat that is not fully captured by the literal rephrasing.  Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the original's directness and specific nuances. Ensure that simplifications do not dilute the core message or the strength of original concepts. For example, consider 'They complained that shooting pigs was too cruel and not needed' to keep the complaint and the 'unnecessary' aspect more connected. For the council's action, use stronger verbs that convey a decision and action, such as 'The city council decided on a new, peaceful way to stop the pigs.'",
