    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7191 is below the required 0.75. While the text is simplified to A2, it subtly alters the core meaning and impact of several key phrases from the original. This indicates a failure to fully convey the original message despite lexical fidelity. Specific deviations are listed below.  - The original phrase 'complained that shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel' is rephrased as 'were angry. They said shooting pigs was too cruel. It was not needed.' This breaks down a single, strong concept into multiple sentences, diluting the specific nuance of 'unnecessarily' and the formal act of 'complaining'.  - The original 'decided to take more peaceful action' is rendered as 'made a new plan. They wanted a more peaceful way to stop the pigs.' The original implies a firm decision and direct action, whereas the rewrite suggests an intention or a preliminary step ('wanted a way'), which is less definitive.  - The word 'strategy' from the original, which implies a well-thought-out, long-term approach, is replaced with the simpler 'plan'. While 'plan' is A2, it loses the strategic depth of the original.  - The idiomatic expression 'losing battle' is replaced with 'fight they cannot win'. While understandable, the original idiom carries a stronger, more concise sense of inevitable defeat that is not fully captured by the literal rephrasing.  Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the original's directness and specific nuances. Ensure that simplifications do not dilute the core message or the strength of original concepts. For example, consider 'They complained that shooting pigs was too cruel and not needed' to keep the complaint and the 'unnecessary' aspect more connected. For the council's action, use stronger verbs that convey a decision and action, such as 'The city council decided on a new, peaceful way to stop the pigs.'",
