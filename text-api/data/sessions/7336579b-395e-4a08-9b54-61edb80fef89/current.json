    "grade": 3,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8554 is below the required 0.90. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of oversimplification. Key phrases like 'people-oriented management style', 'positive reinforcement and recognition', and 'professional development' were replaced with generic terms like 'a way to lead people', 'tell staff they did a good job', and 'training'. This fails to preserve the lexical detail of the source text.\n\n- Grammatical Error: The text contains a repeated and fundamental grammatical error. The structure 'allow employees can choose' is incorrect. The correct A2 structure is 'allow employees to choose'. This error appears in two consecutive sentences.\n\n- Structural Weakness: The text is excessively fragmented. While A2 requires simple sentences, breaking every single idea into a separate sentence is poor form. The two sentences 'Training should focus on social skills. Training should also include different cultures.' must be combined.\n\n- Suggestion: Correct the grammatical error immediately. Re-integrate more precise A2-level vocabulary from the original text to increase fidelity. Combine short, related sentences using simple connectors like 'and'.",
