Your text incorrectly states this as a current fact: 'They give good praise and thanks for the work.' This changes the core message from a recommendation to a description.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6999 is significantly below the 0.75 threshold. This is a direct result of changing a future recommendation into a statement of current fact, which fundamentally alters the text's purpose.\n\n- Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.883 is below the required 0.90. Key phrases from the original, such as 'positive reinforcement and recognition', were not adequately preserved, leading to a loss of lexical detail.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. The sentence 'We suggest Girox Foods use a people\u2011focused way of managing' uses a subjunctive structure ('suggest...use') which is too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Grammatical Error. The sentence 'We need spend more on training' is incorrect. It must be 'We need to spend more on training'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about praise to make it a clear recommendation for the future, not a description of the present. Simplify the sentence structure to remove B1-level grammar; for example, 'We think Girox Foods should...'. Correct the grammatical error.",

The text fails on multiple high-priority checks.\n\nPrimary Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7369 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text makes a formal 'recommendation', but your version weakens this to 'The findings give us a reason'. The important concept of 'challenging staff' was completely omitted, which is a significant loss of meaning.\n\nSecondary Failures:\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8777 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to the over-simplification of key terms. 'Professional development' became 'training' and 'positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'good praise and thanks', losing critical lexical detail.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text B1, not the required A2. The sentence 'We should also let workers choose where they work' contains a subordinate clause ('where they work'), which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- Structural Complexity: The phrase 'a people-focused way of managing' is a complex noun phrase that exceeds the A2 standard.\n- Typographical Error: The text contains a typo: 'especially for5 talking'.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Rephrase the opening to restore the meaning of a 'recommendation'. Use: 'The report shows we should change things.'\n- Re-introduce the missing concept of challenging employees.\n- Eliminate the B1 subordinate clause. Rephrase as two simple sentences. Example: 'Workers can choose a place to work. We should allow this.'\n- Simplify the complex noun phrase. Use: 'a way to manage that is good for people.'",

The metrics confirm this failure with a MeaningBERT score of 0.6293 (below the 0.75 minimum) and a BERTScore of 0.8527 (below the 0.90 minimum).\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score is critically low because the simplification is too aggressive. The original text presents a set of formal, connected recommendations. Your output is a list of disconnected, simplistic statements. The logical relationship between the proposed actions and their intended outcomes is lost.\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because essential vocabulary was eliminated, not simplified. Key concepts such as 'recommend', 'investment', 'professional development', 'positive reinforcement', and 'intercultural communication' are completely absent. This level of information loss is unacceptable.\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is broken into too many short, choppy sentences. This damages the logical flow. The sentence pair \"This can help make a good place for workers. In that place they can do their best work\" is a poor and inefficient substitute for the original's clear statement.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text from the beginning. Focus on simplifying the original concepts, not deleting them. Combine sentences to show how one idea connects to the next. For example, instead of just 'training', use a phrase like 'training to help workers talk to different people'. Restore the core idea that these are formal recommendations for the company.",

Use simple A2 phrases like 'saying thank you for good work' or 'telling staff they did a good job'.\n- Replace 'people-oriented'. Use a simple description like 'a way that is good for people'.\n- Rephrase sentences to retain more of the original key vocabulary in a simplified structure to improve the BERTScore.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The simplification is too extreme, resulting in a text that does not convey the professional recommendations of the source.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.849 is also below the 0.90 minimum. Key professional terms like 'management style', 'positive reinforcement', 'recognition', and 'professional development' were completely removed, not simplified. This damages the fidelity to the source text.\n- Meaning Dilution: The phrase 'a way that is good for people' is a vague and inadequate replacement for 'a more people-oriented management style'. The meaning is lost.\n- Oversimplification: The text is a list of disconnected, simplistic commands. It reads like a checklist, not a summary of a recommendation. The nuance of creating a positive environment for 'best work' is lost in the robotic structure.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to preserve the core professional concepts using A2 vocabulary. Do not simply delete them. Instead of 'a way that is good for people', use 'a management style that is better for employees'. Combine some of the short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to create a more coherent text. The goal is simplification, not the complete destruction of meaning.",

'management style' must be rephrased to 'a way to lead people'. 'flexible' must be rephrased to 'employees can choose'. 'invest' must be replaced with 'put more money in'.

While A2 requires simple sentences, breaking every single idea into a separate sentence is poor form. The two sentences 'Training should focus on social skills.
