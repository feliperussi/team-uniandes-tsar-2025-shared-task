    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well (MeaningBERT: 0.8756, BERTScore: 0.9715), the simplification process has made the language too basic for a B1 target audience. For example, the phrase 'who are between 12 and 18 years old' is a more explicit and simpler construction than the original 'aged 12 to 18'. Additionally, breaking down the original sentence 'Every year one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 are chosen from each district by lottery to compete in a battle in which only one person can survive' into two more direct sentences in the output, and explicitly stating 'These chosen teenagers, known as 'tributes'', contributes to an A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, the text should aim for slightly more complex sentence structures, perhaps by using more varied conjunctions or by condensing some phrases, while still maintaining clarity. For instance, consider rephrasing 'who are between 12 and 18 years old' back to 'aged 12 to 18' or 'between 12 and 18 years old' without the 'who are', and integrating the definition of 'tributes' more fluidly without over-simplifying the sentence structure.",
