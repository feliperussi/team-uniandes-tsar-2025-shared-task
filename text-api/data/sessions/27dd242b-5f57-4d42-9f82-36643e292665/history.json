Additionally, the use of coordinate clauses like 'and the Capitol uses this event to make... remember' instead of relative clauses such as 'which the Capitol uses to remind' simplified the grammatical structure too much. To achieve a B1 level, consider retaining some B1 vocabulary from the original text where appropriate (e.g., 'districts', 'compete', 'survive') and using a mix of simple and compound sentences, including some B1-level relative clauses (e.g., using 'which' or 'who' more naturally) and connectors.",

The simplification effort was minimal, and the output remained very close to the original text, which itself might be at an A2 level. To achieve a B1 classification, the text needs to demonstrate a clearer presence of B1 grammatical structures and vocabulary. For instance, while the combination of the last two sentences into 'The chosen teenagers, who are known as 'tributes', must then be watched by the entire nation on television' introduces an embedded clause, the overall effect was not sufficient to elevate the text to B1.

While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.8652, BERTScore: 0.9713), the linguistic adjustments made the text too simple for the B1 target audience. For example, splitting the original second sentence into two shorter sentences, replacing 'in which' with 'where', and using 'must watch' instead of 'is forced to watch' all contribute to lowering the overall CEFR level. Additionally, replacing 'teenagers' with 'young people' further simplifies the vocabulary. To achieve a B1 classification, consider maintaining a slightly higher level of structural complexity. For instance, some of the original phrasing like 'in which only one person can survive' or 'The chosen teenagers are called 'tributes'' could be retained as they are already appropriate for B1.

To ensure a clear B1 classification, consider introducing a slightly wider range of B1 vocabulary or varying sentence structures more explicitly to demonstrate B1 proficiency. For example, ensure that the majority of sentences contain at least one B1-level grammatical feature or vocabulary item. The addition of 'so that everyone remembers the Capitol's power' at the end, while consistent with the overall theme, is an elaboration not explicitly stated in the original text regarding the purpose of watching the event.

For instance, consider rephrasing 'who are between 12 and 18 years old' back to 'aged 12 to 18' or 'between 12 and 18 years old' without the 'who are', and integrating the definition of 'tributes' more fluidly without over-simplifying the sentence structure.",
