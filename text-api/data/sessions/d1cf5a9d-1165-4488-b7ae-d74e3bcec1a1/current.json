It passed the factual integrity check, meaning and fidelity checks (MeaningBERT 0.8, BERTScore 0.9133), and the CEFR classifier correctly identified it as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A2 level or simpler, with no complex words or idioms from the original text remaining. Sentence structures are short and direct, using only basic A2 connectors like 'So' and 'Then'. The core message is preserved without introducing any linguistic complexity.",
