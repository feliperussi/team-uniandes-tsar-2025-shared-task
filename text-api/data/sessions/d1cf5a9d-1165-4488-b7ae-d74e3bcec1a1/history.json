MeaningBERT score of 0.8 and BERTScore of 0.9133 confirm strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. Vocabulary is consistently A2, with complex terms from the original text appropriately simplified or removed. Sentence structures are short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate forms such as 'and', 'but', 'so', and 'then'. The simplification of 'hit the nail on the head' to 'said many true things' is an exemplary A2 rephrasing. The text successfully conveys the core message using only A2 linguistic resources.",
