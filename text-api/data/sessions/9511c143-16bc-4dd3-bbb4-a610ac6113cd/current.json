Miscommunication means when people do not understand each other. Stereotypes are simple ideas about groups of people. We must remember that stereotypes are very bad for good business relationships.\n\nNational cultures can make us act and think in certain ways. But many other things also affect us. The place where we live affects us. The people we are with affect us. Our age affects us. Our gender affects us. Our corporate culture affects us. Our individual experiences affect us.\n\nSo, we know about these differences. We should remember them. But we must not use this knowledge to judge all people from one country in the same way.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8846 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved. While simplification is necessary for A2, too much lexical deviation results in a low fidelity score. Specific instances include:\n- The phrase 'increased awareness' was simplified to 'very important to know', losing the specific lexical item 'awareness'.\n- 'Detrimental to building good business relationships' was reduced to 'very bad for good business relationships', losing 'detrimental' and 'building'.\n- 'Play a part in shaping the way we behave and think' was simplified to 'can make us act and think in certain ways', losing 'play a part in shaping' and 'behave'.\n- 'Largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with' was broken down and simplified, losing the specific phrasing 'largely influenced by' and 'communities we associate with'.\n- The idiomatic expression 'keep at the back of our minds' was simplified to 'remember them', losing the specific nuance.\n- 'Pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' was simplified to 'judge all people from one country in the same way', losing the specific verb 'pigeonhole' and the more formal 'individuals of an entire nation'.\n\nSuggestion: To achieve the required BERTScore, you must retain more specific vocabulary and phrasing from the original text where possible, even when simplifying sentence structure. For example, 'detrimental' could be simplified to 'very harmful' or 'bad for', but 'building' should be retained as 'making' or 'creating'. The goal is to simplify grammar and complex concepts, not to remove all specific lexical content.",
