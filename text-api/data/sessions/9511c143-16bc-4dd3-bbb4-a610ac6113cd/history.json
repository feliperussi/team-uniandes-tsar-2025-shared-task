The BERTScore of 0.866 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.

The strong negative connotation of 'detrimental to building good business relationships' is weakened to 'bad for making good business connections'. Most critically, the original's specific instruction to 'keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' is reduced to the generic 'But we must not use them. We must not think all people from a country are the same.' This simplification completely misses the specific advice on how to apply the knowledge and the strong warning against 'pigeonholing'. Key lexical items such as 'increased awareness', 'expectations', 'behaviour', 'vital', 'detrimental', 'national cultures', 'shaping', 'largely influenced', 'region', 'communities', 'associate with', 'gender', 'corporate culture', 'individual experiences', 'potential differences', 'therefore', and 'pigeonhole' are either omitted or replaced with overly simplistic and less accurate equivalents.

The CEFR classifier also incorrectly rated this text as B1, not A2, confirming its unsuitability for the target level. Meaning Preservation: The original text's emphasis on 'vital', 'detrimental', and 'largely influenced' is diluted. Your text uses weaker substitutes like 'very important', 'very bad', and 'many other things also affect us', failing to convey the original's precise meaning and impact. Fidelity of Content: Critical terms from the original were replaced with overly simplistic and generic phrases. Examples include 'increased awareness' becoming 'Knowing about', 'miscommunication' becoming 'not understanding each other', 'shaping' becoming 'change', 'communities we associate with' becoming 'groups of people we are with', and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' becoming 'put people into small boxes. We must not think all people from one country are the same'. This constitutes a significant lexical and factual deviation. CEFR Compliance: The text was classified as B1. This is a direct failure of the A2 standard. Specific issues include the complex double negative 'avoid not understanding each other' and the idiomatic expression 'put people into small boxes', both exceeding A2 complexity. The implied 'that' clause in 'We must not think all people from one country are the same' also contributes to this B1 classification.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Preservation Failure. The text failed on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6138 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's nuance and intensity. The BERTScore of 0.887 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier rated this text as B1, not the required A2. This indicates the text is still too complex for the target level. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text's emphasis on 'vital' importance, 'detrimental' effects, and being 'largely influenced' is diluted. Your version uses weaker phrases like 'very important', 'big problem', and 'affect us a lot', which do not convey the same level of urgency or impact. The concept of 'pigeonhole' is also simplified to 'put people in small boxes', losing some of its specific negative connotation. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items from the original were replaced with less precise or less specific terms. Examples include 'miscommunication' becoming 'misunderstanding', 'cultural stereotypes' becoming 'Stereotypes', 'detrimental' becoming 'big problem', 'national cultures' becoming 'country's culture', and 'corporate culture' becoming 'company's culture'. This reduces the fidelity to the original's specific wording. 3. CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The text contains structures that are above the A2 level. For example, the phrase 'how we act and think' uses a noun clause, which is typically B1. The sentence 'If we are a man or a woman affects us.' uses a conditional clause as a subject, a structure more complex than A2. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to ensure all clauses are simple and direct. Avoid noun clauses. Ensure the emotional weight and specific meaning of the original text are preserved through careful A2 vocabulary choices, not just simplification. For example, 'detrimental' could be 'very bad for' or 'really hurts'. Rephrase 'If we are a man or a woman affects us' to 'Our gender affects us' or 'Being a man or a woman affects us'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6616 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance and depth. The BERTScore of 0.8849 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant deviation from the original's specific phrasing and vocabulary. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not A2, which is an instant failure for A2 compliance. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviations: 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The text simplifies concepts too much, losing the precise meaning. For example, 'increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour' becomes 'good to know about different expectations and actions'. 'Detrimental to building good business relationships' becomes 'very bad... really hurt good business relationships'. 'Pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' becomes 'judge people in a wrong way. We must not think all people from one country are the same'. These simplifications reduce the semantic richness and precision of the original. 2. Lexical Fidelity Failure: Many key terms and phrases from the original text were replaced with less specific or less accurate alternatives, leading to a low BERTScore. Examples include 'miscommunication' replaced with 'problems when we talk', 'vital that we also remember' replaced with 'must remember one very important thing', 'national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think' replaced with 'culture of our country can affect our actions and thoughts', and 'corporate culture' replaced with 'culture of our company'. 3. CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The text contains vocabulary that is above the A2 level, leading to a B1 classification. Specifically, the words 'cultural', 'gender', and 'judge' are identified as B1 vocabulary. For example, 'Cultural stereotypes' uses 'cultural', 'Our gender affects us' uses 'gender', and 'judge people in a wrong way' uses 'judge'. These words must be replaced with simpler A2 equivalents. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the original's precision and depth of meaning. Use more direct lexical equivalents where possible to improve BERTScore. Replace all B1 vocabulary (e.g., 'cultural', 'gender', 'judge') with appropriate A2 words or simpler phrases. For 'cultural', consider 'from a country'. For 'gender', consider 'if we are a man or a woman'. For 'judge', consider 'think badly about'.",

Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8804 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key lexical detail and factual phrasing. This means the simplified text does not adequately convey the specific information and nuances of the original.\n\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text conveys a nuanced message about balancing awareness of cultural differences with avoiding detrimental stereotypes, and highlights the multifaceted influences on individual behavior beyond national culture. Your simplified version loses this critical nuance. For example, the original's warning against stereotypes being 'detrimental to building good business relationships' is reduced to 'make good business relationships bad,' which is less precise. The complex idea of 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' is oversimplified to 'think badly about people.

While aiming for A2, it is crucial to retain the specific meaning and key information of the original text. Do not oversimplify to the point of losing the core message or specific concepts. Find A2-level words and phrases that accurately convey the *same specific meaning*, rather than just a general idea. For instance, instead of 'bad,' consider phrases like 'not good for' or 'can hurt' to better reflect 'detrimental.' For 'pigeonhole,' explain the concept of judging all people from a country based on simple ideas, ensuring the specific warning is clear.",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original message's nuance and specific details.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5796 is well below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a nuanced message about the balance between cultural awareness and avoiding detrimental stereotypes, emphasizing that many factors beyond national culture influence individuals. Your version oversimplifies this, losing the critical distinction that awareness should not lead to 'pigeonholing individuals' and the specific warning about stereotypes being 'detrimental to building good business relationships'. The depth of the original's argument is lost.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8823 is below the required 0.90. Key terms and phrases from the original have been replaced with overly simplistic or less precise language, leading to a loss of lexical detail. For example, 'increased awareness' is simplified to 'Knowing more', 'avoid cases of miscommunication' to 'stop us from having problems with understanding', 'detrimental to building good business relationships' to 'not good' and 'hurt good business relationships', and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' to 'put people into simple groups' and 'not think all people from one country are the same'. This reduces the specificity and impact of the original message.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Restore the nuanced message: Ensure the text clearly communicates both the benefit of cultural awareness AND the danger of stereotypes, particularly how they can be 'detrimental' to 'business relationships'. Do not oversimplify the core warning against 'pigeonholing individuals'.\n- Increase lexical precision: Rephrase using A2 vocabulary that more closely aligns with the original's specific concepts. For instance, find A2 ways to express 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', 'corporate culture', 'individual experiences', and 'pigeonhole' without losing their specific meaning. Do not replace specific terms with vague generalities.\n- Maintain key influences: Ensure all the various influences mentioned in the original (region, communities, age, gender, corporate culture, individual experiences) are clearly and distinctly represented in A2 terms, as they are crucial to the original's message about individual complexity.",

The BERTScore of 0.8833 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier rated the output as B1, not A2. This indicates the text is too complex for the target A2 audience.

The sentence 'Knowing about different expectations and actions helps us.' uses a gerund as a subject, which can be a B1 grammatical structure. The extensive fragmentation of the original's logical argument into many short, disconnected sentences diminishes the overall coherence and nuance, contributing to the low MeaningBERT score. The replacement of specific, descriptive phrases from the original with more generic or simplified terms (e.g., 'detrimental to building good business relationships' to 'not good' and 'damage good business relationships'; 'largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world' to a series of separate 'affects us' sentences) led to the low BERTScore.

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. For example, the strong warning that stereotypes 'can be detrimental' is weakened to 'are not good'.

This shows a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Important terms like 'detrimental', 'miscommunication', 'corporate culture', 'individual experiences', and 'pigeonhole' were replaced with simpler, less precise language, diminishing the lexical fidelity to the source text. Suggestion: Restore the strength of the original message. Use stronger A2-appropriate vocabulary to convey 'detrimental' and 'increased awareness'. Ensure key concepts like 'corporate culture' and 'individual experiences' are clearly represented, even if simplified.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Check. The text failed to preserve the core message and key lexical details from the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6081 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original's meaning and emphasis. The BERTScore of 0.8913 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain sufficient lexical overlap with the original text. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviations: The original text emphasizes the 'detrimental' nature of stereotypes and the nuanced advice to 'keep knowledge at the back of our minds' rather than to 'pigeonhole'. Your version softens 'detrimental' to 'cause problems' and simplifies 'pigeonhole' to 'put all people from one country into one small group'. This simplification loses the strong warning and the specific negative connotation of the original. The original's emphasis on 'increased awareness' and 'vital' importance is also diminished. The BERTScore indicates a loss of specific terms. For example, 'miscommunication' was simplified to 'misunderstandings', 'national cultures' to 'culture of our country', 'corporate culture' to 'company culture', and 'individual experiences of the world' to 'own life experiences'. While these are simplifications, the cumulative effect results in a fidelity score below the acceptable threshold. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the strength of the original's warning about stereotypes. Ensure that the negative impact of 'pigeonholing' is clearly conveyed, even with simpler language. Review the original text for key concepts and ensure they are fully represented, even if simplified, to improve meaning preservation.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved. While simplification is necessary for A2, too much lexical deviation results in a low fidelity score. Specific instances include:\n- The phrase 'increased awareness' was simplified to 'very important to know', losing the specific lexical item 'awareness'.\n- 'Detrimental to building good business relationships' was reduced to 'very bad for good business relationships', losing 'detrimental' and 'building'.\n- 'Play a part in shaping the way we behave and think' was simplified to 'can make us act and think in certain ways', losing 'play a part in shaping' and 'behave'.\n- 'Largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with' was broken down and simplified, losing the specific phrasing 'largely influenced by' and 'communities we associate with'.\n- The idiomatic expression 'keep at the back of our minds' was simplified to 'remember them', losing the specific nuance.\n- 'Pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' was simplified to 'judge all people from one country in the same way', losing the specific verb 'pigeonhole' and the more formal 'individuals of an entire nation'.\n\nSuggestion: To achieve the required BERTScore, you must retain more specific vocabulary and phrasing from the original text where possible, even when simplifying sentence structure. For example, 'detrimental' could be simplified to 'very harmful' or 'bad for', but 'building' should be retained as 'making' or 'creating'. The goal is to simplify grammar and complex concepts, not to remove all specific lexical content.",
