The MeaningBERT score of 0.8393 and BERTScore of 0.911 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is entirely within the A2 level, with complex concepts from the original (e.g., 'organising', 'symbolic', 'active', 'emotions') being effectively simplified to A2 terms like 'thinks about things', 'special meaning', 'works less', and 'feelings'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using A2-appropriate connectors such as 'but' and 'when'. The initial definition of 'dreams' is clear and concise for an A2 learner. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
