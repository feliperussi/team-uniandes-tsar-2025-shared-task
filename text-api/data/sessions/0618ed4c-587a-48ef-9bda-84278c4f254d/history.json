The output passed all priority checks, maintaining factual integrity and high scores for meaning (MeaningBERT 0.79) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.96). The CEFR classification is correct at B1. The strategy for defining the keyword 'graffiti' in-text using a relative clause ('which is writing or drawing...') is a perfect example of a B1-level technique. Vocabulary simplification was also handled well, for instance, changing 'ancient sites' to 'very old sites' and 'numerous' to 'many'. The text flows logically and is easy for a B1 learner to follow. A very strong submission.",

Both the MeaningBERT (0.78) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The writer's strategy was outstanding, particularly in how the keyword 'graffiti' was seamlessly defined within the text using a relative clause ('Graffiti, which is writing or drawing...'). Vocabulary simplification was also excellent, with effective replacements like 'ancient' to 'very old' and 'numerous' to 'many', while correctly retaining the appropriate B1-level terms.
