In prehistoric times, for example, people in Africa and Europe painted pictures of animals and people in caves. Graffiti, which is writing or drawing on walls in public places, has been found on buildings at very old sites in Greece, Italy, Syria and Iraq. In the Roman town of Pompeii, archaeologists have found many examples of this writing in Latin, and these messages included religious, political and romantic ideas, as well as some magic spells.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. Both the MeaningBERT (0.78) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The writer's strategy was outstanding, particularly in how the keyword 'graffiti' was seamlessly defined within the text using a relative clause ('Graffiti, which is writing or drawing...'). Vocabulary simplification was also excellent, with effective replacements like 'ancient' to 'very old' and 'numerous' to 'many', while correctly retaining the appropriate B1-level terms. The text flows well and is a model for a B1 simplification.",
