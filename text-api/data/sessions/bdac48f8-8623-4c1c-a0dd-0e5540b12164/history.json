Specific deviations include: The phrase 'in recent years' was simplified to 'now', losing the specific timeframe of the trend. The emphasis on a growing trend, 'bigger and bigger numbers', was reduced to 'more big wild animals', which less effectively conveys the increasing scale. The nuanced question 'Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest?' was simplified to 'Do people like them? Or are they dangerous? Or are they a problem?', losing the specific connotation of 'pest' and the formal 'considered a danger'. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately reflect the original's emphasis on the increasing trend over time and the specific categories of concern (welcome, danger, pest).",
