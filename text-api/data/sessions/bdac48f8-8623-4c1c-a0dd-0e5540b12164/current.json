    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards and accurately conveys the original meaning. All priority checks were passed. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.7766) and BERTScore (0.943) are well above the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A2 level, with appropriate simplifications of B1 words from the original text (e.g., 'recent years' to 'last few years', 'world's press' to 'The news', 'reports' to 'stories', 'considered' to 'are they'). Sentence structures are simple and direct, using A2-appropriate connectors such as 'But', 'For example', and 'Or'. No deviations from the A2 standard were found.",
