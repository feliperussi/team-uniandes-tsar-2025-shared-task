The concept of 'obligatory praise' was also lost.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'feedback' is used. The term 'feedback sandwich' was correctly identified as a keyword for definition, but the B1 word 'feedback' remains in the text. This is a violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The text was broken into excessively short, disconnected sentences. This extreme simplification contributed to the loss of meaning and the resulting low fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. The middle part of the 'sandwich' is the most important and is not neutral. Rephrase to show it is the real, and likely difficult, message. Suggestion: Remove the B1 word 'feedback'. Create a simpler term like 'a talk sandwich' and define that instead. Suggestion: Combine some of the very short sentences to improve readability without increasing complexity.",
