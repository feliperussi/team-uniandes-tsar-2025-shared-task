    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that meets all criteria for the B1 level. The output is factually identical to the original and successfully preserves the core message, as confirmed by high MeaningBERT (0.82) and BERTScore (0.93) metrics. The CEFR classification is correctly identified as B1. The submission demonstrates excellent simplification techniques. The handling of the keyword 'cultural stereotypes' with a clear, parenthetical definition is a model approach. Furthermore, the decision to split the long, complex sentence from the original into two shorter sentences significantly improves readability and flow. The vocabulary choices are superb, particularly the simplification of the idiomatic 'pigeonhole' to the more direct 'label', which is perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
