Additionally, the text fails on CEFR compliance. The classifier result was B2, not the target B1. This is due to overly complex sentence structures for the target level. For example, the sentence beginning \"Although a country's culture...\" is too long and contains a complex list. The use of a gerund phrase as the subject in \"Being more aware...\" also increases complexity. To fix this, break the long sentence into shorter ones and rephrase the opening, for example: \"It can help us avoid misunderstandings if we are more aware...\".
