    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is because the final sentence, 'This raises the question of whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language,' uses a grammatical structure that is too advanced for the B1 level. The text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning excellently, as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores. To fix this, simplify the final sentence by breaking it into two direct questions, similar to the original text. For example: 'This leads to a question. Did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start to produce language?'",
