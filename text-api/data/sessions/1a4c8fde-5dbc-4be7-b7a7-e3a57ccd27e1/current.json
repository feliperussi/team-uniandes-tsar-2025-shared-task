    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an annual event which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for fighting against them in the past. Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district by lottery to compete in a battle in which only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called 'tributes', which is the name for the people who have to fight. The whole nation is forced to watch the event on television.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent B1 submission. The text demonstrates strong communicative competence. The sentence structure is a good mix of simple and complex forms, correctly using connectors like 'which' and 'that'. The vocabulary is perfectly aligned with the B1 level, and you successfully defined the keyword 'tributes' by adding the clause 'which is the name for the people who have to fight'. This shows a clear ability to explain and connect ideas, a key B1 skill. All facts from the original text are accurately preserved.",
