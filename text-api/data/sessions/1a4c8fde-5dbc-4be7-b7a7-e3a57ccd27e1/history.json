        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent B1 submission. The text demonstrates strong communicative competence. The sentence structure is a good mix of simple and complex forms, correctly using connectors like 'which' and 'that'. The vocabulary is perfectly aligned with the B1 level, and you successfully defined the keyword 'tributes' by adding the clause 'which is the name for the people who have to fight'. This shows a clear ability to explain and connect ideas, a key B1 skill. All facts from the original text are accurately preserved."
