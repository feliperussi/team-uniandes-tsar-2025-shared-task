    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5666 is too low; it must be approximately 0.75 or higher. The core message's nuance regarding the newspaper's value and the nature of its problems has been significantly diluted. For instance, the original's 'highly valued' became 'like a lot', and 'cultural enrichment' became 'learn new things about culture', losing the original's specific implications and intensity. The formal concept of an 'environmental issue' was reduced to 'bad for the environment', which is less precise. This indicates a failure to fully preserve the core message beyond basic facts. Additional deviations: - Vocabulary: The word 'printing' is classified as B1. It must be replaced with an A2 equivalent. - Structure: The phrase 'even though' is a B1 structure. It must be simplified to an A2 structure or split into simpler sentences. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to ensure the original's specific concepts and their intensity are preserved using only A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, replace 'printing' with 'making copies'. Reconstruct the sentence containing 'even though' to use only A2 conjunctions like 'but' or 'and'.",
