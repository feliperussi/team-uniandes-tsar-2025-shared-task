    "feedback": "FAIL: Vocabulary Deviation. The text uses the word 'native' which is classified as B1. For an A2 text, all vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 level or below. The metrics for meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.7711) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.9365) are acceptable, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. However, the presence of B1 vocabulary is an immediate failure for A2 compliance. Suggestion: Replace 'native speakers' with A2-level phrasing such as 'people who speak it from birth' or 'first language speakers'.",
