The core message regarding the nuanced relationship between native speakers, learners, and countries is not fully preserved. Specifically, the original text describes a 'correlation' and 'link', while your version introduces a conditional 'If a language is spoken in many countries, many people learn it', which implies a direct causal relationship not present in the original. This alters the intended meaning from a statistical relationship to a direct cause-and-effect. Additionally, the omission of 'combined' when describing English learners slightly diminishes the original's emphasis on English's overall dominance. Your text also contains vocabulary above the A2 standard. The word 'spoken' is a B1 word and is used twice. The word 'connection' is a B1 word and is used twice. These words must be replaced with simpler A2 alternatives. Suggestion: Rephrase the relationship between countries and learners to maintain the concept of a 'link' or 'correlation' rather than a direct conditional cause. Replace 'spoken' with 'people speak it' or similar A2 phrasing. Replace 'connection' with 'link' or 'is related to' using A2 vocabulary.",

While the lexical choices are appropriate for A2, the subtle shift from 'little correlation' to 'only a small link' slightly diminishes the original nuance of the relationship between native speakers and learners, leading to a minor loss of the core message's fidelity. The original implies a more formal, statistical relationship that is weak, whereas 'only a small link' is a more general and less precise description.",

The metrics for meaning preservation (MeaningBERT 0.7711) and fidelity (BERTScore 0.9365) are acceptable, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. However, the presence of B1 vocabulary is an immediate failure for A2 compliance.
