This simplification loses the core meaning of his unique and high-level excellence.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The text also fails the fidelity check.

This is caused by replacing specific, key phrases from the original text like 'best-selling album artists' and 'at the top of his game' with overly simple terms.\n\n- Suggestion: You must restore the lost meaning while maintaining A2 simplicity. Rephrase 'He is still a very good singer' to better reflect 'at the top of his game'. For example: 'He is still one of the best singers'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6575, which is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes Springsteen's continued high-level performance and the enduring relevance of his music ('remains at the top of his game', 'as relevant today as they ever were'). Your output simplifies this to 'He is still one of the best singers' and 'the stories are still important today', which loses the intensity and nuance of the original meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.893 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key descriptive phrases like 'chart-topping', 'stadium-filling', and 'fundamental stories' with overly generic A2 terms. This level of simplification sacrifices too much lexical detail from the source text.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This fragments the logical flow. For example, 'His songs tell our stories. They tell us who we are. That is why the stories are still important today.' This sequence is less coherent than the original's single, connected idea.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to better capture the concepts of continued success and relevance without using complex vocabulary. Combine some of the short sentences to improve logical flow. For example, try to connect the idea of his stories being important directly to the song example. The goal is simplification, not total meaning erosion.",
