    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6031 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to preserve the core message of the original.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of the causal link. The original text explains that Springsteen's success is a direct result of his storytelling. Your version presents his success and his storytelling as two separate, unrelated facts. This is a significant deviation from the original meaning.\n- The phrase \"remains at the top of his game\" describes a continuous, active state of excellence. Your simplification, \"He is still one of the very best,\" is a static description and loses the original's sense of dynamic performance.\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with the A2 level, the simplification has resulted in a critical loss of meaning, as confirmed by the metric score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the cause-and-effect relationship. Combine sentences to show why he is successful. Example: 'He is still very popular because his songs tell our most important stories.' This re-establishes the logical connection from the original text.",
