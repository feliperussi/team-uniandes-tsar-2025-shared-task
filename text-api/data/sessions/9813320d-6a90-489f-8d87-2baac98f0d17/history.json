The core failure is the loss of the central concept of confinement and danger. The original text states Pi is 'trapped in a lifeboat... with a ferocious tiger'. Your version, 'He is on a small boat. He is with a dangerous tiger,' is a simple statement of facts. It fails to communicate that he is trapped and in immediate peril, which is the main point of the story's premise. While the BERTScore is acceptable, the low MeaningBERT score proves that the simplification has fundamentally altered the story's core message. Suggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The sentences must be rephrased to include the concept of being 'trapped'. A correct A2 sentence would be: 'He is trapped on a small boat with a dangerous tiger.'",

The term 'shipwrecked' was simplified to 'His boat sinks'. This loses the specific and dramatic meaning of the original word. The simplification of 'son of a diplomat' to 'father had an important job for his country' is too vague. It loses the specific, international context of the original information.

The original text describes a single, flowing event: a boy is shipwrecked and finds himself trapped. Your version presents these as two separate facts: 'His ship is destroyed... He is trapped...'. This separation reduces the semantic connection between the events. The vocabulary control is excellent. The C1 word 'diplomat' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms. This is the correct procedure. The text correctly classifies as A2 and maintains factual integrity. Suggestion: Re-establish the connection between key events by combining some of the shortest sentences. Use simple connectors like 'and'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6875 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for the low score is the dilution of meaning. The original text uses strong, evocative words like 'extraordinary', 'shipwrecked', 'trapped', and 'ferocious' to create a sense of intense peril and survival. Your version replaces these with weaker A2 equivalents like 'amazing', 'ship sinks', 'on a small boat', and 'dangerous'. While factually adjacent, this substitution loses the central theme of a desperate and remarkable struggle.\n\n- The simplification of 'diplomat' to 'father worked for his country in other countries' also contributes to the meaning loss, though it is a valid A2 simplification strategy. The core failure remains the loss of the story's intensity.\n\n- While the BERTScore of 0.91 and the A2 CEFR classification are acceptable, they are irrelevant due to the failure to maintain the original text's meaning.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the core feeling of the text, not just the facts. Rephrase to restore the sense of danger. Instead of 'He is on a small boat with a dangerous tiger and cannot leave', a better A2 construction would be 'He is alone on a small boat with a tiger and cannot escape'. The word 'escape' better captures the meaning of 'trapped'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6964 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. While the facts are correct, the simplification from 'extraordinary story' and 'ferocious tiger' to 'amazing story' and 'very dangerous tiger' lost the dramatic tone of the original text. The model has correctly identified this loss of nuance as a meaning shift.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'escape' is B1 level and is not permitted. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 list.\n- Structural Simplification: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This contributes to the loss of narrative flow and the low MeaningBERT score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to better capture the original's tone. Replace 'amazing' with a phrase like 'a very special and surprising story'. Remove the B1 word 'escape'. A suitable A2 alternative is 'He cannot get away'. Combine some of the very short sentences to improve the flow, for example: 'The story is about a teenage boy from India named Pi.'",
