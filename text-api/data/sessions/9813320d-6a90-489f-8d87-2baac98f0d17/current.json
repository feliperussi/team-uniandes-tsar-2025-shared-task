    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6964 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. While the facts are correct, the simplification from 'extraordinary story' and 'ferocious tiger' to 'amazing story' and 'very dangerous tiger' lost the dramatic tone of the original text. The model has correctly identified this loss of nuance as a meaning shift.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'escape' is B1 level and is not permitted. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 list.\n- Structural Simplification: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This contributes to the loss of narrative flow and the low MeaningBERT score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to better capture the original's tone. Replace 'amazing' with a phrase like 'a very special and surprising story'. Remove the B1 word 'escape'. A suitable A2 alternative is 'He cannot get away'. Combine some of the very short sentences to improve the flow, for example: 'The story is about a teenage boy from India named Pi.'",
