Now Wasfia is one of the few people who have climbed the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent, like Everest and Kilimanjaro. She is also the first person to spin her hoop on each peak. She did this to help women and girls feel strong and able to play sports, because in her country this is often not allowed.",

This indicates that the simplified text did not fully retain the original\u2019s core message of active empowerment. For example, the original\u2019s phrase \u201cto empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport\u201d was turned into \u201chelp women and girls feel strong and able to play sports,\u201d which softens the intent and removes the explicit call to empowerment. To correct this, reintroduce the term \u201cempower\u201d and preserve the original contrast with societal discouragement, ensuring the text conveys the same level of agency and meaning.",

        "feedback_text": "The rewritten text accurately preserves all facts from the original and maintains the same core message. The definitions for the keywords are well placed: hula hoop as \u201ca plastic ring you spin around your waist\u201d and Seven Summits as \u201cthe highest mountains on each continent.\u201d The text is fluently structured in clear B1-level sentences and uses appropriate connectors (when, although, and, including). To refine further, consider these points: 1. The phrase \u201cyou spin around your waist\u201d uses the C1 word \u201cspin.\u201d A simpler verb like \u201cturn\u201d or \u201cmove\u201d could better match B1. 2. The term \u201cempower\u201d is also at C1 level; you could replace it with \u201chelp\u201d or add a brief definition (for example, \u201cempower, meaning to give strength and confidence\u201d). 3. The nuance of Wasfia \u201creluctantly stood by and watched\u201d was condensed; you might reintroduce \u201creluctantly\u201d to capture her initial hesitation. Addressing these details will tighten fidelity to both the original tone and B1 vocabulary targets.",
