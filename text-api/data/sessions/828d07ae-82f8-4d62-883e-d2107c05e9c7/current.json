She saw a child from another country playing with it, although people in her country believed girls should not play with hoops or ride bikes. Now Wasfia Nazreen is one of the few people who have climbed the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent, including Everest and Kilimanjaro, and she is the first person to hula-hoop on each peak. She did this to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.",

    "feedback": "The rewritten text accurately preserves all facts from the original and maintains the same core message. The definitions for the keywords are well placed: hula hoop as \u201ca plastic ring you spin around your waist\u201d and Seven Summits as \u201cthe highest mountains on each continent.\u201d The text is fluently structured in clear B1-level sentences and uses appropriate connectors (when, although, and, including). To refine further, consider these points: 1. The phrase \u201cyou spin around your waist\u201d uses the C1 word \u201cspin.\u201d A simpler verb like \u201cturn\u201d or \u201cmove\u201d could better match B1. 2. The term \u201cempower\u201d is also at C1 level; you could replace it with \u201chelp\u201d or add a brief definition (for example, \u201cempower, meaning to give strength and confidence\u201d). 3. The nuance of Wasfia \u201creluctantly stood by and watched\u201d was condensed; you might reintroduce \u201creluctantly\u201d to capture her initial hesitation. Addressing these details will tighten fidelity to both the original tone and B1 vocabulary targets.",
