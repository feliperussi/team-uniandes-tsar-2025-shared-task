NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, they found about 8,000. This means there are still 17,000 to find. These asteroids are a big danger. In 2013, a small asteroid exploded over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a very serious problem if they come near Earth.",

Complex concepts from the original text, such as 'logging', 'exploded', and 'enter Earth's orbit', have been expertly simplified into A2-level phrases like 'looking for', 'broke into small pieces', and 'come near Earth'. Sentence structures are simple, clear, and factually accurate. No violations detected."
