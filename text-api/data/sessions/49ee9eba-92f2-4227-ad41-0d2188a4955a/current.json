    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Now NASA is looking for smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or more. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, they found about 8,000. So, they still need to find 17,000. These asteroids are a big danger. In 2013, a small asteroid broke into small pieces over a city in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide, but it hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids are a very serious problem if they come near Earth.",
