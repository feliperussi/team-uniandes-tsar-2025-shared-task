This is an instant failure.\n- The core meaning was lost. The original text states Katniss 'volunteers', which is an act of bravery and choice. Your version, 'Katniss says she will go', removes this important concept and reduces it to a simple statement.\n- A factual discrepancy was introduced. The sentence 'Every year, some children are chosen for a special game' is an addition. The original text does not contain this information. You must only simplify the provided text, not add new facts.\n- The simplification of 'complicated relationship' to 'difficult relationship' is inaccurate. 'Complicated' means not simple; 'difficult' implies it is problematic or hard. The meaning has been altered, contributing to the low meaning preservation score.\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. The concept of 'volunteering' must be preserved. Remove all information not present in the source text. Use more precise A2 vocabulary; for example, 'their relationship is not simple' instead of 'difficult'.",

This word was used without simplification or definition, violating the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by using more precise A2 vocabulary.
