    "text_translated": "Springsteen is different from many other artists who sell a lot of albums. He is in his late 60s, but he still makes new music that is very popular. He plays in big stadiums and is still one of the best musicians. This does not surprise me at all. He tells the most important stories about people's lives in his music. For example, listen to his album *Born in the USA*. You will see that those stories are still important today.",
