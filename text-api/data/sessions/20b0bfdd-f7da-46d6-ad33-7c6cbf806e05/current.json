    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8302 and BERTScore of 0.9176 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. Complex sentences from the original have been appropriately broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, improving readability for a B1 audience. Advanced vocabulary such as 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', 'orbit', 'created', 'threat', 'track', 'predictions', 'impact', 'technology already available', 'at which point', 'defence solutions', and 'launched' have been skillfully replaced with simpler, more accessible terms like 'dangerous asteroids', 'path around the sun', 'made', 'danger', 'follow', 'guesses', 'hit', 'tools and systems which are already available', 'If an asteroid might hit', 'ways to protect Earth', and 'used'. The definition of 'Asteroids' is clear and well-integrated into the text. The overall flow is logical and coherent, making the information easy to understand. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
