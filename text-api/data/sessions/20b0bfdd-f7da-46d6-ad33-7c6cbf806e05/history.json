        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the complexity of certain sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'NASA can follow these objects and make guesses about a possible hit, using the tools and systems that are already available' includes a participial phrase ('using the tools and systems...') which is typically a B2 grammatical structure. Additionally, the sentence 'They come close enough to go less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth's path around the sun' is quite long and dense, combining multiple clauses and descriptive phrases that increase its cognitive load for a B1 reader. While 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' is defined, retaining the full B2 term without further simplification (e.g., to 'dangerous space rocks' or similar) also contributes to the higher complexity. To achieve B1, consider breaking down longer sentences, simplifying complex grammatical constructions like participial phrases, and exploring more accessible synonyms or rephrasing for technical terms even when they are defined.",

This is likely due to the inclusion of the word 'Potentially' in 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', which is identified as a B2 vocabulary item. While it is a specific term, its presence elevates the overall complexity. Additionally, the use of passive voice in 'is believed to be' and the relative clause 'that are already available' might contribute to the B2 classification. To achieve B1, consider rephrasing the definition of 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' to avoid the B2 word 'Potentially' or simplifying the sentence structures further.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8302 and BERTScore of 0.9176 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. Complex sentences from the original have been appropriately broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, improving readability for a B1 audience. Advanced vocabulary such as 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', 'orbit', 'created', 'threat', 'track', 'predictions', 'impact', 'technology already available', 'at which point', 'defence solutions', and 'launched' have been skillfully replaced with simpler, more accessible terms like 'dangerous asteroids', 'path around the sun', 'made', 'danger', 'follow', 'guesses', 'hit', 'tools and systems which are already available', 'If an asteroid might hit', 'ways to protect Earth', and 'used'. The definition of 'Asteroids' is clear and well-integrated into the text. The overall flow is logical and coherent, making the information easy to understand. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
