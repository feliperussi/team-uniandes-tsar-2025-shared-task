The MeaningBERT score of 0.7099 is below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.8395 is below the required 0.90. The primary reason for these low scores is the addition of the introductory sentence 'Asteroids are rocks that fly through space.' While this defines a keyword, it adds information not present in the original text, which is penalized by the metrics for altering the source content. The text also failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a C1 classification instead of the target B1. This is likely due to the final sentence's complexity. The sentence 'These middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they entered Earth's orbit, because a much smaller 19-metre asteroid injured 1,200 people when it exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013' combines multiple clauses and is too long for a B1 level. Suggestion: To pass, remove the added introductory sentence. To achieve a B1 level, split the final complex sentence into two or three simpler sentences. For example: 'These asteroids would be a serious danger if they entered Earth's orbit. This is because a much smaller asteroid injured 1,200 people in Russia in 2013.'

The MeaningBERT score of 0.739 is below the required 0.75. This drop was likely caused by reordering and splitting the final sentence, which changed the original's cause-and-effect structure ('Considering X, Y is a danger') into a statement followed by an example ('Y is a danger. For example, X.'). This alters the logical emphasis. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.86, which is below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to the replacement of specific terms like 'unaccounted for' with more generic phrases, reducing lexical overlap. A secondary issue is the incorrect CEFR classification of B2 instead of the target B1, possibly due to the long first sentence containing multiple clauses. Suggestion: To pass, revise the final section to more closely reflect the original's logical connection, perhaps using a connector like 'because'. Splitting the first sentence could also help achieve the B1 classification."

While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well, the sentence structures are slightly too complex for the B1 level. Specifically, the sentence 'For example, a much smaller 19-metre asteroid injured 1,200 people when it exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013' combines multiple ideas using a subordinate clause ('when it exploded...'). This likely pushed the classification to B2.

This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text. The score was likely impacted by replacing the specific term 'logging' with the more general 'found', and by significantly restructuring the final complex sentence into three simpler ones. While this restructuring improves readability, it reduces the direct word-for-word correspondence with the source, lowering the fidelity score. Additionally, the submission failed a subsequent check. FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the 'B1' target. This is likely due to the combination of technical vocabulary (asteroids, orbit), the use of the passive voice ('have been found'), and the conditional clause ('if they enter Earth's orbit'). To correct this, consider using an active voice (e.g., 'scientists have only found') and rephrasing the conditional to be more direct. On a positive note, the factual integrity is perfect and the keyword 'asteroids' was correctly defined."
