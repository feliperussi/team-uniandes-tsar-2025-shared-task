    "text_translated": "NASA is now working to record smaller asteroids. These are small rocky objects that travel around the sun. They are 140 metres wide or more. There are an estimated 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, scientists have only recorded about 8,000. So, 17,000 have not been found yet. These middle-sized asteroids can be a serious danger. This happens if they enter Earth's orbit. For example, a much smaller 19-metre asteroid shows this danger. In 2013, it exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, and injured 1,200 people.",

    "feedback": "The text passes all checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. This is an excellent simplification. The strategy of defining the keyword 'asteroids' with the sentence 'These are small rocky objects that travel around the sun' is a model of good practice. Furthermore, the complex final sentence from the original text was skillfully broken down into several shorter, logically connected sentences, which greatly improves readability for a B1 audience. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'unaccounted for' with 'not been found yet', are highly effective. No major improvements are needed.",
