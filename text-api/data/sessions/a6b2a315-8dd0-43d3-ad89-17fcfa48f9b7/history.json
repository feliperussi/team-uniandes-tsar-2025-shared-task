The original text's specific concepts like 'evolution as a species' and 'audiovisual perception' were replaced with more general and less precise terms such as 'make people change faster' and 'how we see and hear better'. While the general meaning is conveyed, the lexical fidelity to the source material is insufficient for an A2 simplification that must retain core terminology where possible. Suggestion: Retain more specific vocabulary from the original text where it aligns with A2 understanding, or define it simply. For example, 'evolution as a species' could be simplified to 'how people change over a long time' rather than just 'make people change faster'. 'Audiovisual perception' could be 'how we see and hear things'.",

This indicates a loss of key lexical items from the original text, even though the overall meaning was preserved. The text did not maintain sufficient lexical fidelity to the source material. Specific deviations include: The phrase 'speed up our evolution as a species' was simplified to 'make all people change faster'. While the meaning is conveyed, the specific terms 'evolution' and 'species' are lost, contributing to the lower BERTScore. The term 'augmenting our bodies' was simplified to 'make our bodies better'. The specific verb 'augmenting' is lost. The verb 'implant' was replaced with 'putting'. While 'putting' is simpler, 'implant' is a key term in the original context. Suggestion: Retain more of the original key vocabulary where possible, even with simplification. For example, consider 'help our species change faster' or 'make our bodies stronger' to keep closer to the original lexical content while remaining A2. Use 'put a computer inside our brain' to be closer to 'implant'.",
