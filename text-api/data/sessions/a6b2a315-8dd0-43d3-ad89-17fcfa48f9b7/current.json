    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8001) and BERTScore (0.9037) are well within the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key lexical items. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been appropriately simplified, replacing B1/B2 concepts with A2 equivalents (e.g., 'speed up our evolution as a species by augmenting our bodies' became 'make ourselves change faster. We can make our bodies better.'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using basic connectors suitable for the A2 level. No deviations from the rigorous diagnostic protocol were found.",
