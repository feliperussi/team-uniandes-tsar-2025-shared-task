    "feedback": "PASS: All criteria met. The text demonstrates excellent adherence to the CEFR A2 standard. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.9057) and BERTScore (0.9454) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message and lexical content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms appropriate vocabulary usage, with complex terms from the original text successfully simplified (e.g., 'upsetting' to 'felt sad', 'protect' to 'keep her safe', 'frightening experience' to 'scary time'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using basic connectors like 'But', which is ideal for the A2 level. The addition of 'He flew planes' clarifies the role of a pilot without introducing complexity or factual error.",
