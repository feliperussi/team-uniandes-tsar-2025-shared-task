        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This failure is due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'Earthquakes can damage all structures, including bridges, but such collapses are somewhat rare, especially for modern bridges, because they are built to be stronger' combines three distinct ideas into a single compound-complex sentence. This level of syntactic complexity is characteristic of B2. To correct this, split the long sentences into shorter ones. Suggestion: 'Earthquakes can damage all structures, including bridges. However, these collapses are rare, especially for modern bridges. This is because they are built to be stronger.' This approach preserves the meaning, which was done well (MeaningBERT 0.86, BERTScore 0.95), while simplifying the structure to meet the B1 requirement.",

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.83 and BERTScore of 0.95 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was highly effective. Adding explanatory sentences like 'This is because they are built to be stronger' and 'This helps the bridges stay safe when the ground shakes' significantly improves clarity and flow for the target audience without introducing new information. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'relatively infrequent' to 'rare', were also very well executed. This is a model example of successful text simplification.",
