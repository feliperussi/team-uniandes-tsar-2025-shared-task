    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.83 and BERTScore of 0.95 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy was highly effective. Adding explanatory sentences like 'This is because they are built to be stronger' and 'This helps the bridges stay safe when the ground shakes' significantly improves clarity and flow for the target audience without introducing new information. Vocabulary choices, such as changing 'relatively infrequent' to 'rare', were also very well executed. This is a model example of successful text simplification.",
