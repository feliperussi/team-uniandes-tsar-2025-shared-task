    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6435 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original's core message regarding Julie Wong's status as a 'leading researcher' and the impact of her work. The BERTScore of 0.8741 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: The concept of 'leading researcher' was diluted to 'very important scientist' and 'leads new work', losing the nuance of her established leadership. Key terms like 'published extensively' were simplified to 'writes many papers', losing the intensity of her publication record. 'Highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was fragmented into multiple sentences, losing the concise and specific lexical detail. 'Frequently speaks at international conferences' was simplified to 'often talks at big meetings. These meetings are in many countries. She goes to many of these meetings.', losing the specific terms 'frequently' and 'conferences'. The term 'prestigious' was lost in the description of the fellowship. The verb 'designed' was replaced with 'made the plans for'. These lexical and semantic losses contribute to the low scores and a failure to accurately convey the original's message at the required fidelity.",
