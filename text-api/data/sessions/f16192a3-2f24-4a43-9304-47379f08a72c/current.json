    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5881 is significantly below the required threshold of 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and nuance of the original text.\n\n- The primary failure is the dilution of meaning. The original text uses strong, specific concepts like 'highly valued' and 'significant cost'. Your output reduces these to 'like the newspaper a lot' and 'costs a lot of money'. This simplification loses the intensity and formal weight of the original message, causing the low MeaningBERT score.\n- The term 'cultural enrichment' is reduced to 'learn a lot about culture'. This is a loss of a key concept.\n- The term 'litter on campus' is more specific than 'trash on the university grounds'. This contributes to a loss of lexical precision.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the strength of the original concepts. Rephrase to better capture the intensity. For 'highly valued', use a phrase like 'students and staff think the newspaper is very important'. For 'significant cost', use 'printing the newspaper is a big cost'.",
