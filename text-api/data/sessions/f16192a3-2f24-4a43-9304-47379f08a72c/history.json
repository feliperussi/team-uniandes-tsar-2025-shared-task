The simplification process has removed the semantic weight of the original text, resulting in a loss of core meaning.\n\n- Deviation 1: The phrase 'highly valued' was replaced with 'really like it'. This is a critical failure. 'Valued' implies importance and respect, while 'like' is a simple preference. The core concept of the newspaper's importance to the community is lost.\n- Deviation 2: The concept 'cultural enrichment' was simplified to 'learn about culture'. This is an unacceptable reduction. 'Enrichment' conveys a deep, positive improvement, which is a more complex idea than simply 'learning'.\n- Deviation 3: The original text states the cost is 'significant', implying it is an important and noteworthy problem. Your version, 'costs a lot of money', is a generic phrase that loses this sense of significance.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning more accurately. Do not replace concepts of value and importance with simple preferences. Rephrase to restore the original emphasis. For example, use 'students and staff think the newspaper is very important' to better capture the meaning of 'highly valued'.",
