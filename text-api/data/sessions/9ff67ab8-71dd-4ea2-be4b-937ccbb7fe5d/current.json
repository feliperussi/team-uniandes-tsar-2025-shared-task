    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability requirements. It accurately preserves the factual content and core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.867 and a BERTScore of 0.9256, both well within the acceptable range. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is appropriate for the A2 level, with no unapproved B1/B2 words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors such as 'Or', 'And', 'But', and 'For example' are used correctly and sparingly, aligning with A2 grammatical expectations. No deviations from the rigorous diagnostic protocol were found.",
