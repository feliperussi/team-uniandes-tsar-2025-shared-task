The word 'government' is B1 level and is used without explanation in the sentence 'The Capitol punishes them because they fought against the government.' The word 'lottery' is also B1 and is used without simplification in 'a lottery chooses one boy and one girl'. Explaining 'tributes' was correct, but this does not excuse the other vocabulary failures. The text is not exclusively at the A2 level."

        "feedback_text": "The text fails due to vocabulary violations. The word 'punish' is B1 level and is used twice without simplification. It must be replaced. Instead of 'punish the people', use 'show the people they did something wrong'. The word 'rulers' is B1/B2; replace it with the A2 term 'leaders' or 'the government'. The word 'teenagers' is borderline B1; the A2 phrase 'young people' is the correct choice. The use of the passive voice ('are chosen', 'are picked') is also a complex structure for the A2 level."

Complex concepts like 'punished for rebelling' and 'lottery' are expertly rephrased into simple A2 terms ('did something wrong', 'picks their names by chance'). Necessary B1/C1 keywords ('districts', 'tributes') are introduced and immediately defined in simple language, which is the correct procedure. Sentence structures are simple and clear. No violations detected."
