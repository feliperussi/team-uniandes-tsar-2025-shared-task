    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an event that happens every year. The Capitol uses the games to show the people in the districts they did something wrong. The districts are the different parts of the country. The Capitol does this because the people fought against the government. Every year, the government chooses one boy and one girl from each district. The government picks their names by chance. They are between 12 and 18 years old. These young people are called 'tributes'. A tribute is a person who must fight in the games. They all fight, but only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country must watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It maintains perfect factual accuracy. Complex concepts like 'punished for rebelling' and 'lottery' are expertly rephrased into simple A2 terms ('did something wrong', 'picks their names by chance'). Necessary B1/C1 keywords ('districts', 'tributes') are introduced and immediately defined in simple language, which is the correct procedure. Sentence structures are simple and clear. No violations detected.",
