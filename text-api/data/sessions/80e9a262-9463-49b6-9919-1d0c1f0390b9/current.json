    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets all A2 requirements.\n\nAll metrics are within acceptable ranges. MeaningBERT (0.80) and BERTScore (0.91) confirm meaning and key term preservation. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms strong adherence to the standard.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: All key information from the original text has been preserved without error.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly controlled. The B1 keyword 'rainforest' was correctly identified and defined using simple A2 language at the start of the text. This is the correct procedure.\n- Sentence Structure: The text exclusively uses short, simple sentences. Complex ideas from the original text have been successfully broken down into multiple, easy-to-understand A2 sentences (e.g., 'He used this to talk about a big problem. People were cutting down the trees in the rainforest.').\n\nNo corrections are required.",
