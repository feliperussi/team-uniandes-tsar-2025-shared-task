The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is appropriate, and sentence structures are simple and clear. The complex concept of 'protesting destruction' was correctly simplified into concrete A2 sentences: 'He used this to talk about a big problem. People were cutting down the trees in the rainforest.' The keyword 'rainforest' was defined effectively at the start of the text using A1/A2 vocabulary. The submission is a strong example of A2 simplification.",

The B1 keyword 'rainforest' was correctly identified and defined using simple A2 language at the start of the text. This is the correct procedure.\n- Sentence Structure: The text exclusively uses short, simple sentences. Complex ideas from the original text have been successfully broken down into multiple, easy-to-understand A2 sentences (e.g., 'He used this to talk about a big problem. People were cutting down the trees in the rainforest.').\n\nNo corrections are required.",
