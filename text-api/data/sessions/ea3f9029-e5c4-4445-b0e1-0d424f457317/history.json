It fails to convey the specific, negative moral implication of the word 'cheat', which is central to understanding the 'fixed mindset' reaction.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is classified as B2. Its use in the sentence 'This means they think...' introduces unnecessary complexity. A2 level requires simpler phrasing.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the original meaning. Re-introduce the concept of 'cheating'. The word 'cheat' is understandable at this level. Alternatively, use 'not play fair'. Rephrase the sentence containing 'means'. Example: 'This is called a growth mindset. These children think about what they can do in the future.'",

Your version, 'liked the hard problems', is a significant oversimplification that loses this meaning. Similarly, 'felt that their intelligence was being judged and they had failed' was reduced to 'felt bad' and 'did a bad job', which fails to convey the specific concepts of judgment and failure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'cheat' is B1 level. It was present in the text and was not replaced with an A2-compliant alternative. This is a direct violation of the vocabulary standard.\n\n- Fidelity Warning: While the BERTScore of 0.9097 is technically a pass, the severe drop in the MeaningBERT score shows that keeping key words is not enough if the surrounding context is simplified to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the original concepts using A2 vocabulary.
