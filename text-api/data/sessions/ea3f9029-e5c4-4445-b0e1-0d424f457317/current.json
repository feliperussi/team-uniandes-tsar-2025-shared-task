    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6496 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nThis failure is a direct result of a factual inaccuracy. The original text states children might 'cheat', a specific and serious action. Your version weakens this to 'might not follow the rules', which loses the core meaning of dishonesty and desperation associated with the fixed mindset.\n\nFurther violations detected:\n\nThe B2-level word 'failed' was used. This is too advanced for an A2 text. Suggestion: Replace 'failed' with an A2 phrase like 'did not do well' or 'could not find the answer'.\n\nThe phrase 'felt someone was testing if they were smart' is a weak simplification of 'felt that their intelligence was being judged'. The original implies a final judgment on their innate ability, while your version sounds like a simple quiz. Suggestion: Rephrase to better capture the idea of being judged, for example, 'felt the problems were a test of how smart they are'.",
