    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous to Earth. These dangerous rocks are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). They fly very close to Earth. This is less than 7.5 million kilometres away. NASA made a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them is a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to follow these rocks. It can see if a rock is going to hit Earth. Sometimes a rock is a danger. Then, NASA has two plans to protect us.",
