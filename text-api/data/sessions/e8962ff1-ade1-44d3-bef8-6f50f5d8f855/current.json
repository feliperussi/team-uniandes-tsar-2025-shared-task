    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is primarily because the first sentence is too long and grammatically complex for the B1 level. The sentence 'Many managers place a negative comment between two positive ones, and when this becomes routine employees may see the positive feedback as merely sugarcoating, which is the practice of making something seem nicer than it really is and therefore reduces its value' uses multiple clauses and advanced vocabulary ('merely') that exceed B1 expectations. Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two or three shorter, simpler sentences to align with the B1 target. For example: 'Many managers place a negative comment between two positive ones. When this becomes a routine, employees may see the positive feedback as just sugarcoating. This practice reduces the value of the feedback.' While the text failed on CEFR compliance, it successfully maintained factual integrity and preserved the original meaning, as shown by its high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores.",
