The sentence 'However, when this becomes a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as just a form of sugarcoating, which means covering a bad point with nice words, so its value is reduced' is too long and structurally complex for a B1 level. It contains multiple clauses that should be separated. Suggestion: Break this into shorter sentences, such as: 'However, this can become a routine. When this happens, employees may see positive feedback as just a form of sugarcoating. This reduces its value.' Additionally, the words 'strengthen' and 'means' are classified as B2 level. While 'strengthen' is a good simplification of the original 'reinforce', a B1 alternative like 'support' would be more appropriate.

This is likely due to the overuse of very short, simple sentences like 'This is called sugarcoating.' and 'This reduces its value.' This creates a choppy, elementary feel that is too simple for the B1 level. To reach the B1 target, combine some of these short sentences to create more complex structures. For example, 'When this becomes a routine, employees may see the positive feedback as just sugarcoating, which reduces its value.' On a positive note, the text is factually accurate and successfully preserves the original meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.88, BERTScore: 0.91). The definition provided for the keyword 'sugarcoating' was also clear and well-integrated.",

This is primarily because the first sentence is too long and grammatically complex for the B1 level. The sentence 'Many managers place a negative comment between two positive ones, and when this becomes routine employees may see the positive feedback as merely sugarcoating, which is the practice of making something seem nicer than it really is and therefore reduces its value' uses multiple clauses and advanced vocabulary ('merely') that exceed B1 expectations. Suggestion: Split this complex sentence into two or three shorter, simpler sentences to align with the B1 target. For example: 'Many managers place a negative comment between two positive ones. When this becomes a routine, employees may see the positive feedback as just sugarcoating. This practice reduces the value of the feedback.'
