It passes all quantitative and qualitative checks without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All key information from the original text is present and accurate. No facts were altered or omitted.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2. The metrics (MeaningBERT 0.82, BERTScore 0.92) confirm high fidelity to the source material, exceeding the minimum requirements.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. No B1+ words were used. The keyword definitions for 'shark' and 'lifeboat' are clear and use A2-level language.\n- Structural Simplicity: Complex sentences from the original text were correctly broken down into short, simple sentences connected only by basic conjunctions like 'and' and 'so'. This meets the required standard perfectly.",
