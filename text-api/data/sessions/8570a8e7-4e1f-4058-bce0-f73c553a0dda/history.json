The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, as indicated by the low MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics. This is an instant failure.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6061 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text emphasizes the 'nuances and expectations' of business communication and the potential for 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies this to 'rules for talking are different' and 'it can cause problems. You might not understand people. You might think bad things about them. Talking can stop.' This simplification loses the depth of the original's message about the subtle complexities and specific negative outcomes of cultural differences.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8721 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical information from the original text, such as 'nuances and expectations', 'global business community', 'cultural norms and practices', 'business acquaintances', 'unfair judgements', and 'stand you in good stead', has been lost or replaced with overly simplistic and less precise phrasing. While simplification is necessary for A2, too much specific detail has been removed, impacting the fidelity to the original content.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Restore the core meaning of 'nuances and expectations' by using A2-level phrases that convey subtle differences in communication style and what people expect. Do not just say 'rules for talking are different'.\n- Ensure that the specific negative consequences mentioned in the original, such as 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication', are clearly communicated using A2 vocabulary, rather than just 'problems' or 'talking can stop'.\n- Re-evaluate vocabulary choices to retain more lexical detail from the original while still adhering to A2. For example, 'global business community' could be 'many business people around the world', and 'cultural norms and practices' could be 'how people usually act and what they do in their culture'.",

Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6177 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text's emphasis on 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and the severe consequences like 'breakdowns in communication' were diluted. The simplified version's 'how people talk in business is different' and 'stop people from talking well' do not fully capture the depth of the original meaning. The benefit 'stand you in good stead' was also simplified to 'help you a lot', losing nuance. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8724 is below the required 0.90. Key terms and phrases from the original were lost or overly simplified. For example, 'conducted across international borders' became 'do it between countries', 'majority of the global business community' became 'many business people around the world', and 'cultural norms and practices' was reduced to 'how people usually act and what they do'. The phrase 'breakdowns in communication' was simplified to 'stop people from talking well', losing the specific and stronger meaning of a 'breakdown'. Suggestion: Ensure that all core concepts, even when simplified, retain their original strength and specific meaning. Avoid excessive lexical simplification that removes important details. For example, 'international borders' is an A2 concept and should be retained. 'breakdowns in communication' should be rephrased to convey a similar level of severity, perhaps 'communication stops completely' or 'people cannot talk well anymore'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8727 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific lexical losses include: - 'Much of today's business is conducted' was simplified to 'People do a lot of business today.', losing the verb 'conducted'. - 'global business community' was simplified to 'business people in the world', losing the specific term 'global community'. - 'nuances and expectations' was simplified to 'how people talk... What people expect', losing the concept of 'nuances'. - 'differ greatly' was simplified to 'is different... is also different', losing the intensifier 'greatly'. - 'cultural norms and practices' was simplified to 'culture's ways and cultural practices', losing the term 'norms'. - 'business acquaintances' was simplified to 'people you work with', losing the specific term 'acquaintances'. - 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication' was simplified to 'not understand people... bad ideas about them. This can stop communication.', losing the specific terms 'unfair judgements', 'misunderstandings', and 'breakdowns'. - 'basic areas of differences' was simplified to 'simple differences', losing the term 'areas'. - The idiom 'stand you in good stead' was replaced with 'help you do well', losing the original phrasing. The addition of definitions for 'A culture is how people live and act' and 'Etiquette is about good rules for behavior' introduces new content not present in the original text, further contributing to the low BERTScore by adding unaligned tokens. Suggestion: Ensure all key concepts and specific vocabulary from the original text are preserved or replaced with very close A2 equivalents.
