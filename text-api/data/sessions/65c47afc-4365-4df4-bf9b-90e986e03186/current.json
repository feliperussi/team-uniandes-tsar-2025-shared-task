    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks. The output successfully maintains factual integrity and preserves the core meaning of the original, as confirmed by the high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.94) values. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The key strength of this submission is its structural and lexical strategy. The writer skillfully deconstructed the complex final sentence of the original text into several shorter, more manageable sentences. This greatly improves readability for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the vocabulary choices are exemplary. Abstract concepts like 'fatalism' were not just replaced but explained ('the belief that nothing will change'), which is a sophisticated simplification technique. Similarly, 'demagogues' was appropriately simplified to 'political leaders'.",
