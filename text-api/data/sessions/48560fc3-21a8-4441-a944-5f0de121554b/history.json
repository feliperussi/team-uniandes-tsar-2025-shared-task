        "feedback_text": "FAIL due to fidelity errors and form issues. Fidelity: 'famous album (music collection) artists' changes 'best-selling album artists' (fame \u2260 sales). Major shift: 'is still making hit, stadium (large sport area) concerts with new songs' replaces 'still releasing chart-topping, stadium-filling new music.' You added 'concerts' and removed the clear idea of releasing new music; 'stadium-filling' modifies the music\u2019s draw, not the existence of concerts. Form: The first sentence has 24 words with stacked parentheses\u2014too long for B1 and not clear. The last sentence has 16 words, slightly above the B1 target. Positives: Keywords are briefly defined ('Springsteen (famous American singer)', 'Born in the USA (Springsteen album)'). Vocabulary stays mostly B1 and connectors are simple. However, the factual shifts make it non-faithful to the Original."

        "feedback_text": "Mixed B1 control. Keywords defined correctly: \u201cSpringsteen (famous American singer)\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA (Springsteen album)\u201d. However, the first sentence is too long and cluttered: \u201cUnlike many other famous album (music collection) artists, Springsteen (famous American singer) is still making hit, stadium (large sport area) concerts with new songs.\u201d (~24 words, multiple parentheses). Fidelity issues: The original states he is \u201cstill releasing \u2026 new music\u201d; you changed it to \u201cstill making \u2026 concerts,\u201d which shifts from releasing music to performing shows. \u201cHit concerts\u201d misrepresents \u201cchart-topping\u201d (charts measure songs/albums, not concerts). Another fidelity drift: \u201cstories about ourselves\u201d became \u201cstories about people,\u201d losing the first-person focus. Grammar/lexis are mostly B1 and simple in other sentences (\u201cI am not surprised.\u201d, \u201cHe is also very good at his work in his late 60s.\u201d). Connectors are simple. Overall pass, but penalized for the long, complex first sentence and the meaning shifts."
