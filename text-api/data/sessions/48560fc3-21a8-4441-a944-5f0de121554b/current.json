    "text_translated": "Unlike many other best-selling album artists, Springsteen (famous American singer) is still releasing new music. His music tops charts and fills stadiums. He is at the top of his game in his late 60s. I am not surprised at all. He tells us our most fundamental stories about ourselves. When you listen to Born in the USA (Springsteen album), his stories are still relevant.",

    "feedback": "Mixed B1 control. Keywords defined correctly: \u201cSpringsteen (famous American singer)\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA (Springsteen album)\u201d. However, the first sentence is too long and cluttered: \u201cUnlike many other famous album (music collection) artists, Springsteen (famous American singer) is still making hit, stadium (large sport area) concerts with new songs.\u201d (~24 words, multiple parentheses). Fidelity issues: The original states he is \u201cstill releasing \u2026 new music\u201d; you changed it to \u201cstill making \u2026 concerts,\u201d which shifts from releasing music to performing shows. \u201cHit concerts\u201d misrepresents \u201cchart-topping\u201d (charts measure songs/albums, not concerts). Another fidelity drift: \u201cstories about ourselves\u201d became \u201cstories about people,\u201d losing the first-person focus. Grammar/lexis are mostly B1 and simple in other sentences (\u201cI am not surprised.\u201d, \u201cHe is also very good at his work in his late 60s.\u201d). Connectors are simple. Overall pass, but penalized for the long, complex first sentence and the meaning shifts.",
