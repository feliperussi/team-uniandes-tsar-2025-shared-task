    "text_translated": "Ed Stafford, who is from the UK, was the first person to walk the whole length of the Amazon River. He started his journey at a small stream in the Andes mountains in Peru and, after walking 6,000 kilometres, he arrived at the river's mouth in Brazil two years and four months later. The Amazon rainforest, which is home to dangerous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, meant Ed was in constant danger. Fortunately, he survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks.\n\nPriority 1: Factual Integrity Check - No factual errors were found. All names, numbers, locations, and events are accurately preserved from the original text.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.9313 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9758 is also well above the 0.90 threshold, showing strong lexical and factual fidelity to the original.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The text was correctly classified as 'B1', meeting the target CEFR level.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis -\nStructure and Flow: The text demonstrates good B1-level sentence structures. The use of relative clauses (e.g., 'who is from the UK', 'which is home to dangerous snakes') is appropriate for B1. The rephrasing of 'having walked 6,000 kilometres' to 'after walking 6,000 kilometres' simplifies the grammatical structure effectively. The causal link 'so Ed was in constant danger' was rephrased to 'meant Ed was in constant danger', which is a suitable B1 alternative. The overall flow is natural and easy to follow.\n\nVocabulary Strategy: The simplification of 'poisonous snakes' to 'dangerous snakes' is an excellent example of appropriate lexical adjustment for a B1 audience, replacing a potentially higher-level word with a more accessible synonym while maintaining meaning. Other B1 vocabulary candidates like 'stream', 'rainforest', 'ant', 'constant', and 'mosquito' were correctly retained, as they are suitable for the B1 level. No keywords were identified for definition, and the vocabulary choices reflect a solid understanding of B1 lexical requirements.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong simplification that effectively meets all requirements. The changes made enhance readability without sacrificing any essential information or meaning.",
