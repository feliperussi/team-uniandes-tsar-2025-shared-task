He started his journey at a small river in the Andes mountains in Peru. He walked for 6,000 kilometres and, two years and four months later, he arrived at the end of the river in Brazil. The Amazon forest, which gets a lot of rain, is where you can find dangerous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, so Ed was always in danger. Fortunately, he was okay and only got bitten by thousands of small flying insects and small insects.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' level. This indicates that the simplification process resulted in a text that is too simple for the target audience. Several factors contributed to this: The original complex sentence 'He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river's mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres' was split into two simpler sentences in the output. While this can aid comprehension, it significantly reduces the overall sentence complexity, which is a key characteristic of B1 texts. Additionally, specific and common B1-level vocabulary such as 'mosquito' and 'ant' were replaced with more generic A1/A2 descriptions like 'small flying insects' and 'small insects'. While 'dangerous snakes' is an acceptable simplification for 'poisonous snakes', the over-simplification of common animal names lowers the lexical complexity unnecessarily. To achieve a B1 level, the text should aim for a balance of sentence structures, including some compound or complex sentences, and retain specific, common B1 vocabulary when it does not impede understanding. For instance, 'mosquito' and 'ant' are generally understood at B1 and could have been kept.",

All names, numbers, locations, and events are accurately preserved from the original text.\n\nPriority 2: Meaning and Fidelity Check - The MeaningBERT score of 0.9313 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9758 is also well above the 0.90 threshold, showing strong lexical and factual fidelity to the original.\n\nPriority 3: CEFR Compliance Check - The text was correctly classified as 'B1', meeting the target CEFR level.\n\nPriority 4: Semantic and Qualitative Analysis -\nStructure and Flow: The text demonstrates good B1-level sentence structures. The use of relative clauses (e.g., 'who is from the UK', 'which is home to dangerous snakes') is appropriate for B1. The rephrasing of 'having walked 6,000 kilometres' to 'after walking 6,000 kilometres' simplifies the grammatical structure effectively. The causal link 'so Ed was in constant danger' was rephrased to 'meant Ed was in constant danger', which is a suitable B1 alternative. The overall flow is natural and easy to follow.\n\nVocabulary Strategy: The simplification of 'poisonous snakes' to 'dangerous snakes' is an excellent example of appropriate lexical adjustment for a B1 audience, replacing a potentially higher-level word with a more accessible synonym while maintaining meaning. Other B1 vocabulary candidates like 'stream', 'rainforest', 'ant', 'constant', and 'mosquito' were correctly retained, as they are suitable for the B1 level. No keywords were identified for definition, and the vocabulary choices reflect a solid understanding of B1 lexical requirements.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong simplification that effectively meets all requirements. The changes made enhance readability without sacrificing any essential information or meaning.",
