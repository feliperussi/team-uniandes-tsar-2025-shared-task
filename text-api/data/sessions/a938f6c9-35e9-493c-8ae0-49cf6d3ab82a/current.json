Trains had steel wheels and tracks. The wheels moved on the tracks. This made a spark. A spark is a small, hot light. Sometimes, this spark made the wood bridge catch fire. Then the whole bridge would burn down.",

Your version states \"most bridges were made of wood\", which incorrectly implies that the majority of bridges were made of wood. This is a significant factual deviation. Suggestion: Rephrase to accurately reflect the original statement about the quantity of wood bridges, for example, \"Many bridges were made of wood\" or \"A lot of bridges were made of wood\".",
