        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5229 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text emphasizes the historical prevalence ('more bridges') and the heightened vulnerability ('much more susceptible to fire'). Your version, 'many bridges were made of wood. Fire was a big danger for them. Fire could destroy them fast,' simplifies this to a point where the comparative degree of susceptibility and the inherent risk are diminished. The nuance of 'could sometimes cause' in the original is also lost in the more direct 'could make' in your version, altering the probabilistic nature of the event. The core message regarding the specific and elevated risk of wooden bridges, particularly train bridges due to sparks, is not fully preserved in its original intensity and detail. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the degree of susceptibility and the occasional nature of the fire ignition, ensuring the core meaning is not diluted by oversimplification.",
