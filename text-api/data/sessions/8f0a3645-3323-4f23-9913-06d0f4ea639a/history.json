        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on multiple high-priority metrics. The primary failure is the inability to preserve the original text's meaning and fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7058 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8879 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a critical loss of the original message and key vocabulary. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: Score of 0.7058 is too low. The simplification of 'inequality and discrimination' to 'when some people are not treated the same' is too vague and loses the core concepts.\n- BERTScore Failure: Score of 0.8879 is too low. Key lexical items like 'inequality', 'discrimination', and 'political points' were replaced, causing a drop in fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1. This is an instant failure. The presence of B1 vocabulary and structures caused this.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text includes words above the A2 level. 'used' (B1), 'politics' (B1), 'beauty' (B1), and 'being' (B2) are not A2 compliant.\n- Structural Complexity: The phrase 'kept being made' is a complex passive structure (B2 level). The clause 'when some people are not treated the same' functions as a noun phrase, which is a B1 structure.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Replace all B1 and B2 vocabulary immediately. 'politics' must be rephrased using A2 words like 'ideas about the government'. 'beauty' must be replaced with 'beautiful things'.\n- Suggestion: Eliminate complex grammatical structures. Rephrase 'graffiti kept being made' to 'people still made graffiti'.\n- Suggestion: Simplify the sentence 'They made art about when some people are not treated the same.' to two simple sentences. Example: 'Some people are not treated fairly. The artists made art about this idea.'",

Rephrase the sentence about political points to 'Some artists wanted to make people think about important problems in the world, like war or when people are not treated fairly'.

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\nStructural Violation: The sentences 'They made pictures about when some people have fewer rights than others' and 'They also made pictures about why some people are treated badly' use subordinate clauses starting with 'when' and 'why'. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not permitted at the A2 level.\nLexical Loss: Key concepts from the original text were oversimplified, causing the low fidelity score. For example, 'make political points' was reduced to 'share ideas about people', and the abstract noun 'beauty' was replaced with the less precise 'nice pictures'.\nSimplification of Concepts: While explaining 'inequality' and 'discrimination' is necessary for A2, the method used created grammatically complex sentences that are not compliant.\n\nSuggestion: Break down complex ideas into multiple, simple sentences. Do not use connecting words like 'when' or 'why' to create subordinate clauses. The text must be rewritten to say: 'Some people have fewer rights than other people. Artists made pictures about this.'

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7328 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8757 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text states artists produced art 'that tried to make people think about' specific issues. Your version disconnects the social problem from the art's purpose by stating them in separate sentences ('Some people have fewer rights... Artists made pictures about this.'). This structure fails to convey the intended meaning that the art itself was a form of commentary.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low because key phrases were oversimplified, losing fidelity. 'An explosion in street art' was reduced to 'grew a lot'. The concepts of 'inequality' and 'discrimination' were broken down into phrases that do not carry the same weight or specific meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'political' was used in the phrase 'make political points'. This word is not compliant with the A2 standard and must be simplified or removed.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the direct link between the art and its purpose. Rephrase the section about social issues to show the art was made *because* of them or *to show* them. Replace the word 'political' with an A2-level description, such as 'art about the government or important ideas for the country'.",
