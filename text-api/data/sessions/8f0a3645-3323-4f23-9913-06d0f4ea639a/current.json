    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states artists made art about 'war, inequality and discrimination'. Your output omits 'war'. This is an immediate failure.\n\nSecondary Failures:\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8916 is below the required 0.90. This confirms that key information from the original text was lost.\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The text is not at an A2 level. You used the words 'politics' (B1), 'inequality' (C1), and 'discrimination' (C1). These words are significantly above the A2 CEFR level and were not simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the missing fact about 'war'. You must replace all words above the A2 level. Rephrase complex ideas using simple A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of 'inequality', write 'when some people do not have the same chances as others'. Instead of 'discrimination', write 'treating some people badly because they are different'.",
