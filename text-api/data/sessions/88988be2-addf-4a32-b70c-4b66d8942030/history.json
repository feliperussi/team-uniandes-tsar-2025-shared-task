The core message regarding the specific nature and depth of relationships has been diluted through oversimplification. Specific instances include: The original text emphasizes 'self-disclosure' and 'heart-to-heart' as specific types of deep emotional sharing. Your version simplifies this to 'talk about your feelings' and 'deep talks', losing the precise nuance of the original's emphasis on a particular kind of intimate communication. The phrase 'That deeper connection is all-important' in the original explicitly links the inadequacy of superficial friendships to the necessity of profound ties. Your version replaces this with the generic 'This is very important', which weakens the direct causal link and the specific reference to 'deeper connection'. The original's 'at least one person' implies a minimum requirement, which is lost in your 'one person'. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific concepts of 'self-disclosure' and 'deeper connection'. Ensure that the importance of these specific types of relationships is clearly conveyed, rather than generalized.",
