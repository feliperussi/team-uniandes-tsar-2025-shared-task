They spent time with them often. You also need at least one person. You can share your true feelings with this person. This is a very deep talk. One person for these deep talks is enough. You also need other relationships. It is not enough to have many friends. It is not enough to just do things with them. It is not enough to talk about music or football. You need a deeper relationship with people. This deeper relationship is very important. Some people need to learn to listen well. This helps them make stronger relationships.",
