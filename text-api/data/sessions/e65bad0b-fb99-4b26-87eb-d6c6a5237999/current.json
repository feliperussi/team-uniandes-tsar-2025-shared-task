One group answered positively, saying they liked the challenge and believed they could develop their abilities. Dweck calls this a growth mindset \u2013 the idea that people can improve their abilities. They focus on what they can achieve in the future. Another group felt that people were judging their intelligence and that they had failed. They showed a fixed mindset \u2013 the idea that abilities cannot change and they cannot imagine improving. Some of these children said they might cheat later, while others tried to find someone who had done worse than them to feel better about themselves.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.94) are very high, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The standout feature of this submission is the exemplary handling of keywords. Both 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' were not just kept, but were clearly and simply defined in context, which is a best-practice approach. Vocabulary simplification was also strong, for instance, changing 'boost their self-esteem' to the much more accessible 'feel better about themselves'. For future improvement, consider the B2-level word 'failed'. While it is a common word, a phrase like 'had done badly' could be a slightly better fit for the B1 level. Overall, this is a high-quality and effective simplification.",
