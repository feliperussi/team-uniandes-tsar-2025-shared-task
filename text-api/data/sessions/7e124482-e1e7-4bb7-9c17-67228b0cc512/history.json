As part of this, we should look for ways to give our employees work hours that can change. We should also think about how we can allow employees to work from the places they choose. Managers need to find different ways to give our staff interesting tasks. They should also give more positive comments and show that they value the work people do. Spending more money on job training could also help create a good work environment. Training in how to communicate with different people and cultures would be very useful.
