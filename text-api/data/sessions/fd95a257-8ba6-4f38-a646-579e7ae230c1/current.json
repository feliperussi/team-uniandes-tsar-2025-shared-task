    "feedback": "PASS: The text demonstrates perfect adherence to the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All key facts, numbers, and the core message from the original text are accurately preserved. The simplification of 'Chelyabinsk' to 'a city in Russia' is an appropriate adaptation for the A2 level.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly uses A2 vocabulary and grammatical structures. The sentence construction is simple and clear, avoiding any B1-level complexity. The metrics confirm this with a CEFR_Classifier_Result of 'A2'.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.76 and BERTScore of 0.92 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- Readability: The use of short sentences, simple connectors ('but', 'so', 'if'), and two distinct paragraphs makes the information easy to follow for an A2 reader.",
