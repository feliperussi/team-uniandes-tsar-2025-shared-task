No discrepancies were found.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.76 and BERTScore of 0.9162 are well within the acceptable ranges, confirming high fidelity to the source material.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct and supported by the linguistic evidence.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. No B1 or higher words were used. The keyword 'asteroids' was correctly defined in simple terms (\"big rocks in space\").\n- Structural Simplicity: Sentences are short and clear. The use of connectors ('but', 'so', 'if') is appropriate for the A2 level and does not introduce B1-level complexity. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",

The sentence construction is simple and clear, avoiding any B1-level complexity.
