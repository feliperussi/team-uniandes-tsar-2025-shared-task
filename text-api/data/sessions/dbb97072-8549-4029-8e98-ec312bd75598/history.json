The MeaningBERT score of 0.5988 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's nuance and emphasis. The BERTScore of 0.8908 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key lexical information. The simplification was too aggressive, stripping away critical details that convey the original's intent. Specific deviations are listed below: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes Julie Wong's high professional standing, using terms like 'leading researcher', 'published extensively', 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals', and 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship'. Your version reduces this to 'important scientist', 'many papers', 'other scientists read her papers', and 'special award'. This simplification loses the core meaning of her exceptional prominence and the high esteem in which her work is held. 'Important' and 'special' are too generic to convey the original's strong positive connotations. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key descriptive words and phrases from the original were omitted or replaced with less specific terms, leading to a loss of lexical fidelity. For example, 'leading researcher' became 'important scientist', 'published extensively as author and co-author' became 'wrote many papers', 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' became 'other scientists read her papers', 'international conferences' became 'big meetings... for people from many countries', and 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' became 'special award... from the Royal Academy'. These replacements, while simpler, do not adequately capture the original's specific vocabulary. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the concepts of 'leading', 'extensive publication', 'high regard', and 'prestige' using A2-level vocabulary. For example, instead of 'important scientist', consider 'a very good scientist'. Instead of 'special award', consider 'a very important award'. Ensure that the simplified text still conveys the strength of her achievements, not just the basic facts.",

The BERTScore of 0.8869 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation from the original's key words and factual phrasing. The original text emphasizes Julie Wong's high standing and the prestige of her achievements with words like 'leading researcher', 'extensively published', 'highly regarded', and 'prestigious'. Your version uses 'top researcher', 'wrote more than 50 papers', 'special science magazines', and 'very important award from a big science group'. This simplification dilutes the impact and prestige of her accomplishments, altering the core message about her eminence in her field. Key lexical items from the original were replaced with less specific or different terms, leading to a low BERTScore. Examples include 'Robotics and AI' becoming 'robots and AI', 'published extensively as author and co-author' becoming 'wrote more than 50 papers. She wrote some with other people', 'peer-reviewed journals' becoming 'special science magazines. Other scientists check them first', 'international conferences' becoming 'big meetings. These meetings are for people from many countries', and 'prestigious Royal Academy' becoming 'big science group'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the extent of lexical replacement here is too high, failing to maintain sufficient fidelity to the original wording. The word 'clever' for 'smart home' is an acceptable A2 word, but 'smart' in the context of 'smart home' has a specific technological meaning that 'clever' does not fully capture, contributing to the meaning shift. Suggestion: To improve MeaningBERT, ensure that the degree of achievement and recognition is maintained, even with simpler words. For example, instead of just 'top researcher', consider 'a very important researcher'. To improve BERTScore, try to retain more key nouns and specific phrases where possible, or find closer A2 equivalents that convey the same specific meaning. For instance, 'journals' could be 'science books' or 'science papers' rather than 'magazines' if the context allows, and 'conferences' could be 'big science talks' if 'meetings' is too generic. Rephrase 'prestigious Royal Academy' to convey the importance of the group more directly, perhaps 'a very famous science group'.",

The BERTScore of 0.891 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating an unacceptable loss of key words and factual phrasing. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The overall impression of Julie Wong's high professional standing, the extensive nature of her publications, and the prestige of her award are significantly diluted. For example, 'leading researcher' became 'very important researcher', and 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was simplified to 'important science books. Other scientists check them first', losing the specific quality and rigor implied by the original. The term 'prestigious' was also lost.\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms from the original text were either omitted or replaced with less precise alternatives. Examples include 'leading', 'field of', 'published extensively', 'highly regarded', 'peer-reviewed', 'international conferences', 'prestigious', and 'designed'. This results in a less accurate and less detailed representation of the original content.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'royal' is classified as B1 and 'academy' as C1 in the provided vocabulary candidates. While part of a proper noun ('Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship'), the strict A2 standard requires all words to be at or below A2. The inclusion of these words, even within a proper noun, constitutes a deviation from the A2 vocabulary level.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase sentences to more accurately convey the original meaning, ensuring that the significance of Julie Wong's achievements is not diminished. For instance, find A2 ways to express 'leading' and 'highly regarded'.\n- Restore key lexical items where possible, or find A2 synonyms that maintain closer fidelity to the original terms. For example, instead of 'big science talks', consider 'talks for scientists from many countries'.\n- Address the vocabulary issue by either simplifying the proper noun if its meaning can be preserved at A2, or by providing a very simple A2 explanation of what the 'Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' is, without directly using the B1/C1 words in the main narrative if possible. If the proper noun must be used, acknowledge its complexity and ensure the surrounding text is impeccably A2.",

These simplifications, while aiming for A2, have resulted in a substantial degradation of the original text's meaning and detail. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary and intensity while still adhering to A2 structures.

The text loses the nuance and impact of Julie Wong's achievements. For example, 'leading researcher' is simplified to 'very important researcher', and 'prestigious' is simplified to 'very important award', which diminishes the original meaning of high recognition and influence. The term 'extensively published' is also lost, reducing the scope of her work. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8873 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key lexical items from the original text. Words like 'leading', 'extensively', 'highly regarded', and 'prestigious' were not adequately replaced with A2 equivalents that preserve their specific meaning. Furthermore, the text contains vocabulary above the A2 level. The word 'Royal' is B1, 'Academy' is C1, and 'fellowship' is B2/C1. While these are part of a proper noun, they are not simplified or explained in A2 terms, which is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard. Suggestion: Rephrase to convey the full significance of Julie Wong's role and achievements using only A2 vocabulary. For the award, consider simplifying the name or explaining its nature in A2 terms, for example, 'a special prize from a famous science group'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Preservation Failure. The text fails to meet the required standards for both meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6306 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8789 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key lexical items and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are listed below: 1.  MeaningBERT Failure: The original text conveys a sense of 'leading,' 'prestigious,' and 'extensive' achievement. Your simplification to 'top researcher,' 'many papers,' and 'special job' loses the intensity and significance of these achievements. For example, 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' is reduced to 'special job. It was for her research. It was from the Royal Academy,' which omits the 'prestigious' quality and the specific type of award ('fellowship'). 2.  BERTScore Failure: Key terms and phrases from the original text were not adequately preserved or were replaced with overly simplistic or descriptive phrases that do not maintain lexical fidelity. Examples include: a.  'published extensively' was simplified to 'wrote many papers,' losing the adverb 'extensively.' b.  'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was replaced with 'very good science magazines. Other scientists check these papers first,' which is a descriptive explanation rather than a lexical match. c.  'international conferences' was replaced with 'talks. Scientists from many countries come to these talks,' again, a descriptive explanation. d.  The proper noun 'Simone Fielding' was entirely omitted. e.  'fellowship' was replaced with 'special job. It was for her research.' Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the core meaning of 'extensive,' 'highly regarded,' and 'prestigious' using A2-appropriate vocabulary. Ensure proper nouns like 'Simone Fielding' are retained. Aim for a closer lexical match where possible, even with simplification, to improve BERTScore.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved.

Specific instances of lexical deviation include: - The term 'leading researcher' was simplified to 'very important researcher', losing the specific nuance of 'leading'. - 'Published extensively' was replaced with 'wrote many, many papers', losing the lexical detail of 'published extensively'. - 'Highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was simplified to 'very important science magazines. Other scientists check these papers first.', losing 'highly regarded' and replacing 'journals' with 'magazines'. - 'Frequently speaks at international conferences' was rephrased as 'often gives talks to scientists from many countries', losing 'frequently' and 'international conferences' as direct lexical matches. - 'Prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was simplified to 'very important award. It was the Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship.', losing 'prestigious'. - 'Smart home she designed herself' was changed to 'smart house.

Suggestion: While simplifying for A2, ensure that the chosen A2 vocabulary maintains a closer lexical match to the original where possible, without increasing complexity.
