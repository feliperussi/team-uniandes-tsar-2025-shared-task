    "grade": 4,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8935 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved. While simplification is necessary for A2, the lexical fidelity to the original must remain high. Specific instances of lexical deviation include: - The term 'leading researcher' was simplified to 'very important researcher', losing the specific nuance of 'leading'. - 'Published extensively' was replaced with 'wrote many, many papers', losing the lexical detail of 'published extensively'. - 'Highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was simplified to 'very important science magazines. Other scientists check these papers first.', losing 'highly regarded' and replacing 'journals' with 'magazines'. - 'Frequently speaks at international conferences' was rephrased as 'often gives talks to scientists from many countries', losing 'frequently' and 'international conferences' as direct lexical matches. - 'Prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was simplified to 'very important award. It was the Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship.', losing 'prestigious'. - 'Smart home she designed herself' was changed to 'smart house. She made the plans for this house herself.', replacing 'home' with 'house' and 'designed' with 'made the plans for'. Suggestion: While simplifying for A2, ensure that the chosen A2 vocabulary maintains a closer lexical match to the original where possible, without increasing complexity. For example, 'journals' could potentially be retained if deemed A2, or a closer synonym used. Re-evaluate replacements to maximize lexical overlap while adhering to A2.",
