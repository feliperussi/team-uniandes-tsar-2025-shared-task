The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level, despite successfully passing the factual and meaning preservation checks. The B2 classification is likely due to two main issues. First, the opening sentence is too long and structurally complex, combining a non-defining relative clause ('which are large rocks in space') with a subordinate clause. Second, the text retains the B2-level adverb 'Potentially' from the original. Suggestion: Simplify the opening by splitting the first sentence into two. For example: 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids are large rocks in space. They are considered dangerous because they can pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit.' This would improve readability and better align with B1 sentence structure expectations.",
