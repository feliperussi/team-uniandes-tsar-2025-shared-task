They saw leopards on the streets of Mumbai. And they saw wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Do people like them? Or do people think they are a danger or a pest? A pest is an animal that causes problems for people.",

The final question could have been rephrased to avoid this term entirely, for example: 'Or do people think they are a danger or a problem?' The rest of the text is a strong simplification, but this single vocabulary violation results in failure."

The replacement of terms like 'world's press' with 'newspapers and TV news' and 'pest' with 'problem' is exemplary. No violations of the rules were found."
