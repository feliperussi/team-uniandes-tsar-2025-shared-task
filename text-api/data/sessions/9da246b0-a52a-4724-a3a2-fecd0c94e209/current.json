    "text_translated": "You can often see small animals like birds, squirrels, mice and insects in many cities and towns. But in the last few years, newspapers and TV news have many stories about wild animals. More and more wild animals are coming into cities. For example, people saw bears in parks in Vancouver. They saw leopards on the streets of Mumbai. And they saw wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when bigger animals come into our cities? Do people like them? Or do people think they are a danger or a problem?",
