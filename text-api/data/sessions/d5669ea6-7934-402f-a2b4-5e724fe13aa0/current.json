    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that serves as a model for B1 text. The output successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.80) and BERTScore (0.94) are both well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The handling of the keyword 'graffiti' is outstanding; it was defined clearly and naturally within the first sentence. Vocabulary choices were excellent, such as replacing the B2 word 'council' with 'cities' and using the B1 verb 'decorate' to add nuance. The clarification of 'free to paint' to 'can paint and write on walls legally' is a sophisticated improvement that enhances clarity for the target audience. No improvements are necessary.",
