        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7377 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This failure is likely due to a subtle but significant change in meaning in the first sentence. The original text states councils encourage artists 'not to paint graffiti randomly', which implies redirecting the behavior. The output changes this to encouraging artists 'to stop painting graffiti', which implies a complete cessation of the activity. This alters the core message. To correct this, the sentence should be revised to better capture the original's intent of redirection, for example: 'Some cities have tried to stop artists from painting graffiti in random places by giving them special areas to work in.' Despite this critical failure, the submission correctly passed the factual integrity check, achieved the target B1 CEFR level, and successfully defined the keyword 'graffiti'.",

The MeaningBERT (0.80) and BERTScore (0.94) are both well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The handling of the keyword 'graffiti' is outstanding; it was defined clearly and naturally within the first sentence. Vocabulary choices were excellent, such as replacing the B2 word 'council' with 'cities' and using the B1 verb 'decorate' to add nuance. The clarification of 'free to paint' to 'can paint and write on walls legally' is a sophisticated improvement that enhances clarity for the target audience. No improvements are necessary.",
