    "grade": 4,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8947 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Deviation: Key terms like 'leading researcher' and 'peer-reviewed' were replaced with overly simple phrases. This caused the fidelity score to drop below the minimum threshold.\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2: The text includes the B1 word 'scientific'. The proper noun 'Royal Academy' contains B1 ('royal') and C1 ('academy') level words, increasing complexity.\n- Structural Complexity Exceeds A2: The sentence 'Julie lives with her family in a smart home she designed herself' uses a reduced relative clause, a B1 grammatical structure. The use of the present perfect tense ('has written') is also a B1 indicator.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore lexical fidelity. Replace 'scientific' with 'science'. Split the sentence containing the reduced relative clause into two simple sentences. Change 'has written' to the simple past 'wrote'.",
