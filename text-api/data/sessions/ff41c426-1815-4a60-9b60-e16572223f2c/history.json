This indicates a significant loss of key descriptive words from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Error: Key concepts were oversimplified, causing the metric failure. The original text's 'prestigious' award was reduced to just 'an award', losing the core information about its importance.\n- Vocabulary Compliance Failure: The text is not A2 compliant. You failed to simplify B1, B2, and C1 level words. The phrases 'highly regarded peer\u2011reviewed journals' and 'Royal Academy' contain multiple words ('highly', 'peer', 'royal', 'academy') that are too advanced for an A2 reader.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore lost meaning. Change 'an award' to 'a very important award'.\n- Suggestion: Remove all non-A2 vocabulary. Replace 'highly regarded peer\u2011reviewed journals' with a simple A2 phrase like 'very good science magazines'. Explain the proper noun 'Royal Academy' in simple terms, such as 'a special group for science'.",

The proper noun 'Royal Academy' contains B1 ('royal') and C1 ('academy') level words, increasing complexity.\n- Structural Complexity Exceeds A2: The sentence 'Julie lives with her family in a smart home she designed herself' uses a reduced relative clause, a B1 grammatical structure. The use of the present perfect tense ('has written') is also a B1 indicator.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore lexical fidelity. Replace 'scientific' with 'science'. Split the sentence containing the reduced relative clause into two simple sentences. Change 'has written' to the simple past 'wrote'.",
