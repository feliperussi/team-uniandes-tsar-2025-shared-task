        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required thresholds for both meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.72 is below the required 0.75, indicating a slight loss of the original's core message intensity. The BERTScore of 0.89 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n\nDeviation 1: MeaningBERT Score. The original text conveys a strong sense of urgency and the broad societal danger of 'completely unethical and dangerous for humanity' and 'very cautious indeed'. While the simplified text covers the points, the intensity and nuance of the original message are slightly diluted. For example, 'I think this is very bad. It is morally wrong.' is less impactful than 'completely unethical and dangerous for humanity'. The core message's emotional and ethical weight is not fully preserved at the required level.\n\nDeviation 2: BERTScore. Key lexical items from the original were replaced with simpler, less specific phrasing, leading to a loss of fidelity. Examples include 'terrifying Terminator' replaced by 'the robot that kills people. It steps on people's heads.', 'military machines' replaced by 'Army robots', 'gun turrets and sentry robots' simplified to 'robots with guns' and 'robots that watch', and 'autonomous' replaced by a descriptive phrase 'choose who to kill by themselves'. While these simplifications are appropriate for A2, the BERTScore metric specifically measures the retention of original phrasing, which was not met.\n\nDeviation 3: CEFR Compliance. The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. This indicates that the text contains linguistic elements above the A2 level, making it too complex for the target audience.\n\nDeviation 4: Vocabulary Audit. The word 'Campaign' is explicitly listed as a B1 word in the provided vocabulary candidates, yet it is used in the sentence 'Its name is 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots''. This is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard. Additionally, the phrase 'morally wrong' contains 'morally', which is a B1 concept, further contributing to the B1 classification.\n\nSuggestion: To improve MeaningBERT, ensure the emotional and ethical weight of the original message is fully conveyed, even with simpler words. For BERTScore, while simplification is necessary for A2, try to retain more direct lexical links where possible without increasing complexity. For CEFR compliance and vocabulary, strictly adhere to A2 word lists. Replace 'Campaign' with an A2 word like 'group' or 'organisation'. Rephrase 'morally wrong' to 'very bad' or 'not good' to avoid B1 vocabulary.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to adequately preserve the core message and lexical detail of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6613 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original's intent and tone. The BERTScore of 0.8942 is also below the required 0.90, showing a dilution of key vocabulary and phrasing. Deviations are as follows: 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text conveys a strong, urgent warning about the ethical implications and dangers of autonomous weapons. Your version, while stating 'very bad' and 'wrong for people', loses the specific ethical dimension of 'unethical' and the urgency of 'very cautious indeed'. The phrase 'I think this is very bad. It is wrong for people. It is very dangerous for all people.' is a weaker expression of 'completely unethical and dangerous for humanity'. The original's direct contrast 'Forget the movie image... and think of what's happening right now' is broken into less impactful, separate sentences. 2. Fidelity Failure: Key lexical items and specific phrasing from the original have been lost or overly simplified, contributing to the low BERTScore. For example, 'terrifying Terminator stamping on human skulls' is reduced to 'robots in films... They are scary'. 'military machines', 'gun turrets', 'sentry robots' are replaced by generic descriptions like 'robots with guns' and 'robots that watch places'. The term 'unethical' is completely absent. 3. Vocabulary Dilution: While aiming for A2, the simplification has removed crucial B1-level concepts that are essential to the original's message, such as 'unethical' and 'humanity' in its broader sense, without finding suitable A2 equivalents that retain the full meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the strong warning tone and the specific ethical concerns. Use A2 vocabulary to convey the concepts of 'unethical' and 'humanity's danger' more directly. Ensure that specific examples like 'Terminator' and 'gun turrets' are either retained or replaced with equally vivid and accurate A2 descriptions to maintain lexical fidelity. Strengthen the connection between the movie image and the real-world threat.",

The phrase 'dangerous for humanity' is rendered as 'dangerous for all people. It is very dangerous for everyone.', which is redundant and less impactful than the original. The lexical choice of 'Army robots' instead of 'military machines' contributes to the lower BERTScore. Suggestion: Rephrase to better capture the original's persuasive tone and the specific concept of 'unethical'. Ensure key terms, even when simplified, retain more of their original lexical weight. Review the simplification of 'unethical and dangerous for humanity' to ensure the full impact is preserved.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7185 is below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a strong ethical warning using terms like 'completely unethical' and 'dangerous for humanity', and emphasizes the concept of 'autonomous' decision-making. Your version simplifies 'unethical' to 'very wrong' and 'humanity' to 'all people', which dilutes the specific ethical concern and the scope of the danger. The nuance of 'autonomous' is also less precise when described as 'choose who to kill by themselves'. The BERTScore of 0.899 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific terms from the original such as 'gun turrets', 'sentry robots', 'human input', and 'cautious indeed' were replaced with less precise or more descriptive phrases like 'robots with guns', 'robots that watch places', 'People control them very little', and 'very, very careful'. While these replacements are simpler, they do not maintain the required lexical fidelity to the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific ethical weight of 'unethical' and the precise meaning of 'autonomous'. Ensure key descriptive nouns like 'gun turrets' and 'sentry robots' are either retained or defined in a way that preserves their specific meaning more closely, if A2 vocabulary allows.",
