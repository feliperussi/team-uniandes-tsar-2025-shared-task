    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text as required by the protocol. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7185 is below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a strong ethical warning using terms like 'completely unethical' and 'dangerous for humanity', and emphasizes the concept of 'autonomous' decision-making. Your version simplifies 'unethical' to 'very wrong' and 'humanity' to 'all people', which dilutes the specific ethical concern and the scope of the danger. The nuance of 'autonomous' is also less precise when described as 'choose who to kill by themselves'. The BERTScore of 0.899 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific terms from the original such as 'gun turrets', 'sentry robots', 'human input', and 'cautious indeed' were replaced with less precise or more descriptive phrases like 'robots with guns', 'robots that watch places', 'People control them very little', and 'very, very careful'. While these replacements are simpler, they do not maintain the required lexical fidelity to the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific ethical weight of 'unethical' and the precise meaning of 'autonomous'. Ensure key descriptive nouns like 'gun turrets' and 'sentry robots' are either retained or defined in a way that preserves their specific meaning more closely, if A2 vocabulary allows.",
