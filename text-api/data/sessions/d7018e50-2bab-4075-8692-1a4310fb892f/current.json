It also has two ways to stop an asteroid that could hit our planet.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7151 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This failure is caused by the removal of critical data from the original text, specifically the number of asteroids ('1,400') and the proximity definition ('7.5 million kilometres'). Replacing these facts with general terms like 'many' and 'very close' significantly weakens the core message. The submission also fails on a second high-priority check: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is a result of oversimplification; the text consists of short, disconnected sentences that lack the complexity and flow required for B1. To correct this, you must reintroduce the key numbers to restore the original meaning. Additionally, combine some of the short sentences using B1-level connectors to achieve the target CEFR level. For example: 'Although NASA has mapped 1,400 of these asteroids, it does not expect any to be a threat in the next hundred years.'",
