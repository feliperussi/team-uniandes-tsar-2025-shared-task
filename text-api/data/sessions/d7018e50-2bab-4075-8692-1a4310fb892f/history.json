The original text specifies 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', but the output incorrectly shortens this to 'Hazardous Asteroids'. This changes the scientific meaning, as the term 'potentially' is a critical part of the official classification. Accuracy must be the top priority. Additionally, the output failed the CEFR compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the required 'B1'. This is likely because the word 'means' was used, which is classified as a B2 level vocabulary item. The sentence 'This means it can track these objects...' raised the overall complexity. To correct this, first restore the full, accurate term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. Second, to achieve a B1 level, rephrase the final sentences. For example, instead of 'NASA has the technology it needs. This means it can track...', try a more direct B1 construction like 'Using its technology, NASA can track these objects and predict a possible impact.'",

The factual accuracy and meaning preservation were excellent, with high BERTScore (0.925) and MeaningBERT (0.869) scores. However, the sentence structures are too advanced. The sentence 'They are rocks that pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit' uses a long relative clause, and the final sentence uses a conditional 'If...' clause. These structures likely pushed the classification to B2. Suggestion: To correct this, simplify the sentence structures. For example, split the complex sentence into two simpler ones: 'These are rocks that can pass close to Earth. They can pass within 7.5 million kilometres of our orbit.'",

The output is factually correct and successfully preserves the core meaning of the original, passing the first two priority checks. However, it fails on the target CEFR level. The B2 classification is likely due to the density of specific technical information. Phrases like '7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit' and the number '1,400', even when presented in simple sentences, can increase the conceptual load and be interpreted by the classifier as too complex for the B1 level. To improve, consider breaking down these technical concepts further. For instance, 'They can pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth\u2019s orbit' could be simplified to 'They can travel in space and pass very close to our planet, Earth' to make the concept more accessible.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7151 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This failure is caused by the removal of critical data from the original text, specifically the number of asteroids ('1,400') and the proximity definition ('7.5 million kilometres'). Replacing these facts with general terms like 'many' and 'very close' significantly weakens the core message. The submission also fails on a second high-priority check: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2' instead of the target 'B1'. This is a result of oversimplification; the text consists of short, disconnected sentences that lack the complexity and flow required for B1. To correct this, you must reintroduce the key numbers to restore the original meaning. Additionally, combine some of the short sentences using B1-level connectors to achieve the target CEFR level. For example: 'Although NASA has mapped 1,400 of these asteroids, it does not expect any to be a threat in the next hundred years.'",
