This is a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary error is the definition of 'vandalism'. The original text states that writing on property is considered vandalism. Your text defines vandalism as 'when someone breaks something that is not theirs'. This is a different meaning and fundamentally alters the source text's argument. The BERTScore of 0.8928 is also below the 0.90 minimum, caused by replacing key terms like 'public or private property' with less precise phrases. Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of vandalism to align with the original text. It must be defined as the act of painting or writing on property that you do not own. Do not introduce the concept of 'breaking something'.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text presents a nuanced conflict between 'point of view' and the legal definition of 'vandalism'. Your version oversimplifies this into 'Some people think it is art. But other people think it is a crime', which loses the essential contrast between opinion and law.\n- Secondary Deviation (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.897 is below the required 0.90. This is caused by replacing specific, key terms from the original. For example, 'city councils' was replaced with the vague phrase 'People who run the cities', and 'pay fines' was reduced to 'pay money'. This damages the factual precision of the text.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning. Restore the contrast between personal opinion ('point of view') and the legal reality ('considered vandalism'). Use more precise A2 vocabulary to increase fidelity; for example, 'city leaders' is better than 'people who run the cities'.",

These words are too advanced for an A2 reader.\n\n- B1 Structural Violation: The sentence 'Vandalism is when someone paints on property that is not theirs' uses a 'when-clause' to provide a definition. This is a B1-level grammatical structure. An A2 text must use simpler, more direct sentences.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace 'property' with 'buildings' or 'things that are not theirs'. Replace 'private property' with 'buildings that people own'.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the definition of vandalism. Example: 'Vandalism is a problem. Someone paints on a building.
