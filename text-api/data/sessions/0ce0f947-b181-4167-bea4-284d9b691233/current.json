    "text_translated": "Around the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that the things we see in our dreams represent feelings that are hidden from our normal, awake mind. Freud had an idea about this. He believed that if we understand our dreams, we can understand these hidden feelings and the problems they cause.\n\nHowever, the other theory was the opposite. It said that dreams are just a collection of activity without a pattern in the brain. This happens while the brain organizes memories from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these unplanned images and feelings, so we put them together into a story.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.96) metrics confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are excellent. For example, replacing the complex concept 'conscious mind' with the more accessible 'normal, awake mind' is very effective. Similarly, simplifying 'random activity' to 'activity without a pattern' is a precise and clear choice for the B1 level. The decision to split a longer, more complex sentence into two shorter ones also significantly improves readability without losing meaning. This is a strong example of successful text simplification.",
