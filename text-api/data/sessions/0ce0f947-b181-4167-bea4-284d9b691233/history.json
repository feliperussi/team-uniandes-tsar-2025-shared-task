        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to the use of long, multi-clause sentences and B2-level vocabulary. For example, the sentence 'Freud believed that if we understand what our dreams are telling us, we can understand these hidden feelings and the problems which they cause' contains multiple nested clauses, which increases its complexity. Similarly, the sentence about the 'other theory' is a long compound-complex sentence. The use of the word 'random' (a B2-level word) also contributes to the higher classification. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, break these complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones. For instance, the Freud sentence could be split into: 'Freud had an idea about this. He believed that if we understand our dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause.' Also, consider replacing 'random' with a simpler B1 alternative like 'unplanned' or 'without a pattern'. On a positive note, the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with excellent scores, indicating the core message was kept intact.",

        "feedback_text": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.96) metrics confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are excellent. For example, replacing the complex concept 'conscious mind' with the more accessible 'normal, awake mind' is very effective. Similarly, simplifying 'random activity' to 'activity without a pattern' is a precise and clear choice for the B1 level. The decision to split a longer, more complex sentence into two shorter ones also significantly improves readability without losing meaning. This is a strong example of successful text simplification.",
