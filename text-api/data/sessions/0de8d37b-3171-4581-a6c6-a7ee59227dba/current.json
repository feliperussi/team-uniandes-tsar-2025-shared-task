    "feedback": "PASS. The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. The B1 keyword 'Earthquake' is correctly defined at the start. Complex vocabulary such as 'engineers', 'structures', 'collapse', and 'resistant to movement' has been skillfully replaced with A2-level equivalents like 'people who build bridges', 'buildings and bridges', 'fall down', and 'does not move so much'. Sentence structures are simple and declarative. Factual accuracy is maintained. No violations detected.",
