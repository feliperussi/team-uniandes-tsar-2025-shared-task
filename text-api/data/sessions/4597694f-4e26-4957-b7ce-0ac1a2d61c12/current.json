The text is correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: Passed. Vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structure is exemplary for the A2 level; complex ideas are deconstructed into short, simple declarative statements. The simplification of the final sentence into four distinct parts is a model of A2 writing.",
