No discrepancies were found.\n- Meaning Preservation: Metrics are strong. The MeaningBERT score of 0.84 and BERTScore of 0.90 confirm that the core message and key lexical items were preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The linguistic features are appropriate for the target level.\n- Vocabulary Audit: All vocabulary is within the A1-A2 range. The use of 'mind', 'brain', and 'feelings' is appropriate for A2. No B1 or higher vocabulary was detected.\n- Structural Analysis: The writer correctly broke down the original complex sentence about the brain into four simple, sequential sentences. This is an exemplary A2 simplification technique. The consistent use of short sentences and basic connectors meets the standard precisely.",
