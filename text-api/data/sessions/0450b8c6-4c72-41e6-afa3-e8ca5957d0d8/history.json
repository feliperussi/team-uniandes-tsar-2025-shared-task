The term 'nuclear weapon' was replaced with 'big bombs', and the specific detail 'eight-ton rockets' was removed. These are key facts, not optional details.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (Classifier): The text was classified as B1, not A2. The word 'means' is a B2-level vocabulary item. The definitional structure 'X means Y' is too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Error: The sentence 'PHA means a space rock that could hit Earth' uses a relative 'that-clause' which, combined with the B2 vocabulary, increases complexity beyond the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the term 'nuclear bombs'. It is a critical fact. Rephrase the definitions to eliminate the word 'means'. Use simple, separate sentences. Example: 'A PHA is a space rock. It could hit Earth.' and 'HAMMER is a plan from NASA.

The replacement of 'nuclear' with 'special' is the primary cause of this low score.\n\nThe core concept of using a 'nuclear weapon' is central to the original text. Replacing it with 'special bombs' fundamentally alters the meaning and removes the most important detail.\n\nWhile the sentence structure and most vocabulary choices are A2-compliant, the failure to preserve a critical fact is a non-negotiable error.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the term 'nuclear bombs'. The word 'nuclear' is essential for factual accuracy. It cannot be replaced. If a B1 word is critical to the meaning, it must be kept and defined for the A2 reader.",
