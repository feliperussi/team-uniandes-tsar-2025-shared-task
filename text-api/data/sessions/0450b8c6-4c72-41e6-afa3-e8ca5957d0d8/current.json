    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The text fails on the most critical check. The original text specifies the use of 'nuclear bombs', a key fact. Your output replaces this with 'a big thing', which is factually incorrect and meaningless. This error is also reflected in the metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.69 is well below the required 0.75, indicating a severe loss of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.87 is also below the 0.90 threshold, showing a failure to retain key terms.\n* The primary error is replacing a specific, important concept with a vague, inaccurate placeholder.\n* Suggestion: Restore the core fact. Rephrase the last two sentences. Use the A2-level word 'bomb'. A correct simplification would be: 'If the asteroid is close, the rockets would carry special bombs. These bombs would blow the asteroid up.'",
