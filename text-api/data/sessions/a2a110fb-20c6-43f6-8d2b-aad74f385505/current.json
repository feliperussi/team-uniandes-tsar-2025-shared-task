    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5882 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text provides a cohesive explanation of venom's purpose, but your output is a disconnected list of facts that fails to convey this central message. This is an instant and total failure.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8783 is below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a significant loss of key vocabulary and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of unacceptable vocabulary choices.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text contains multiple words that are not on the A2 list. This is a severe error. The words 'used' (B1), 'prey' (C1), 'species' (B1), 'bite' (B1), 'rarely' (B1), and 'tiny' (B1) were all found in the output. This is non-negotiable.\n\n- Corrective Action: You must remove all vocabulary above the A2 level. Replace 'prey' with 'the small animals they eat'. Replace 'species' with 'kinds of spiders'. Replace 'rarely' with 'do not often'. Rewrite the text to restore the original's core message about the purpose of venom.",
