The text fails on fundamental content preservation metrics.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score is too low because the logical structure of the original text was discarded. The original text moves from a general statement about venom to specific examples. Your output begins with a specific example, defines a term, then presents the general statement, destroying the logical flow and thus altering the core message.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is too low due to excessive simplification of key vocabulary. Replacing 'fatalities' with 'died', 'prey' with 'food', and 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs' with 'throw tiny hairs' resulted in a significant loss of lexical fidelity from the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The text uses multiple B1-level words, which is a direct violation of the A2 standard. The words 'poisonous', 'poison', 'bite', 'rarely', and 'tiny' are not A2-compliant.\n\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text to match the original's logical order. Start with the general fact about most spiders, then introduce the specific examples. Replace all B1 vocabulary. Replace 'poisonous' with 'can make you very sick'. Replace 'rarely' with 'not often'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary failure is a catastrophic loss of meaning and fidelity, confirmed by metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5616 is far below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8768 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates the simplification process destroyed the core message and lexical integrity of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains the *purpose* of venom (to kill prey) and contrasts this with its effect on humans. Your version presents these as disconnected facts, losing the central explanatory point. The phrase 'stop their food' is a poor substitute for 'stunning or killing their prey'.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key lexical items like 'prey', 'deadly', 'fatalities', and 'defend' were removed. Their replacements were too simple and failed to carry the original meaning, causing the low BERTScore.\n\n- CEFR Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'bite', which is classified as B1 level. This word was not included in the keywords for definition. Unapproved B1 vocabulary is an automatic failure for an A2 text.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. While A2 requires simplicity, the complete lack of connectors like 'and' or 'because' makes the text choppy and contributes to the loss of logical flow between ideas.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by explicitly stating venom is for food, not for people. Replace the B1 word 'bite' with an A2 phrase like 'when a spider puts its teeth in you'. Connect related sentences with simple A2 conjunctions to improve readability and logical flow.",

The BERTScore of 0.8617 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key lexical details from the source.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.60): The original text explains concepts with cause and effect. Your version breaks these into disconnected statements, losing the logical connections. For example, the original links venom's purpose to prey, contrasting it with its effect on humans. Your version lists these as separate, unrelated facts.\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.86): Key terms were replaced with overly simple words, losing precision. 'Fatalities' became 'died', and 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs' became 'use small hairs'. This simplification is too extreme and damages the factual detail.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of using unapproved B1 vocabulary. The words 'bite' and 'defend' are B1 level and were not simplified.\n- Quality Control Failure: The sentence 'When they feel scared, they use small hairs to defend themselves.' is duplicated.

Key lexical details were lost. For example, 'ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs' was oversimplified to 'throw tiny hairs', losing the specific meaning of the original phrase.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 classification was caused by using vocabulary above the A2 level. The word 'bite' is B1 and was used twice. The word 'tiny' is also B1. These words are not permitted.\n\n- Suggestion: Re-write the text to combine sentences using A2 connectors like 'so' and 'because' to restore logical meaning. Replace all B1 vocabulary. For 'bite', use an A2-level description like 'when a spider puts venom in you'. For 'tiny', use 'very small'.",

The core message of the original text was not preserved.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text establishes a critical contrast: venom is for prey, NOT for attacking humans. Your version completely omits this contrast, fundamentally altering the message.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8629 is below the required 0.90. This confirms that key lexical details and phrasing from the original text were lost during simplification.\n\n- Tertiary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The classifier rated the text as B1, which is an automatic failure. The text is too complex for the A2 standard due to specific grammatical structures.\n\n- Structural Deviations from A2 Standard:\n  - The sentence 'They use venom to stun or kill the animals they eat' contains a relative clause ('they eat'). This is a B1 structure.\n  - The sentence 'Anti\u2011venom is a medicine that stops venom' contains a relative clause ('that stops venom'). This is a B1 structure.\n  - The sentence 'Because anti\u2011venom exists, no one has died...' begins with a subordinate clause. This is a B1 structure.\n\n- Corrective Path:\n  - Restore the core meaning. The text must state that spiders use venom for prey and not for humans.\n  - Eliminate all B1 structures. Split sentences with relative clauses into two simple sentences. Example: 'Anti-venom is a medicine. It stops venom.'\n  - Do not start sentences with 'Because'. Rephrase to place the 'because' clause after the main clause. Example: 'No one has died since 1981 because doctors have anti-venom.'",

The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8525, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains the purpose of venom (for prey, not humans).

This fragmentation is the direct cause of the low MeaningBERT score.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses unapproved vocabulary above the A2 level. The word 'prey' is C1. The words 'bite', 'rarely', and 'tiny' are B1. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n- Structural Failure: The text has been oversimplified into a fragmented list. A2 level requires simple sentences, but not to the point that all logical flow is eliminated. Basic connectors like 'and' or 'but' are expected and necessary.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to connect ideas. Combine sentences using A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', and 'so'. Replace all vocabulary rated B1 or higher. 'Prey' must be replaced with an A2 phrase like 'the small animals that spiders eat'. 'Rarely' must be replaced with 'not often'. 'Tiny' must be replaced with 'very small'.",

Focus on keeping the original logic. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', and 'because' to link ideas instead of just listing them.
