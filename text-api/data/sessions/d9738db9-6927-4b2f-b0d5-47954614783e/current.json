    "text_translated": "Asteroids are large rocks that fly in space. NASA is now working to find and record information about smaller asteroids. These are asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far. This means 17,000 of them are still not found. This is a serious problem because even a small asteroid can be dangerous. For example, an asteroid that was only 19 metres wide exploded over a city in Russia in 2013. It hurt 1,200 people. So, these bigger asteroids would be a very serious danger if they come near Earth.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text is clear, coherent, and logically structured. You have successfully demonstrated the ability to write connected text by using connectors like 'but', 'because', and 'so' to link your ideas and provide reasons (e.g., 'This is a serious problem because...'). Your use of varied sentence structures, including sentences with relative clauses like 'an asteroid that was only 19 metres wide', is a strong indicator of B1 competence. The vocabulary is appropriate and well-managed, and all the key information from the original text is included accurately. This is a very strong performance.",
