    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.78) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 classification is accurate. The writer demonstrated strong simplification skills by replacing complex vocabulary with simpler, high-frequency alternatives (e.g., 'A large number' to 'Many', 'collapses' to 'fall down'). Furthermore, the restructuring of the final sentence into two, linked by the causal clause 'When this mistake happens', is a model technique for improving clarity and flow for a B1 audience. No improvements are necessary.",
