        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. This is likely due to the use of B2-level vocabulary, specifically the words 'being' and 'collapse', which were identified as candidates for replacement but were retained in the final text. Additionally, the passive voice construction 'is being built' adds complexity. Suggestion: Replace 'is being built' with a simpler active construction like 'while workers build the bridge'. Replace 'collapse' with a B1-friendly alternative like 'fall down'. Splitting the first long sentence into two shorter ones would also help reduce complexity and improve readability for a B1 audience.",

The MeaningBERT (0.78) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 classification is accurate. The writer demonstrated strong simplification skills by replacing complex vocabulary with simpler, high-frequency alternatives (e.g., 'A large number' to 'Many', 'collapses' to 'fall down'). Furthermore, the restructuring of the final sentence into two, linked by the causal clause 'When this mistake happens', is a model technique for improving clarity and flow for a B1 audience. No improvements are necessary.",
