    "text_translated": "Julie Wong is an important researcher. She studies robots and computers that can think.\n\nShe wrote more than 50 papers. She wrote some papers alone and some with other people. The papers are in good science magazines.\n\nShe often speaks at big meetings in different countries. In 2012, she won a very important prize.\n\nJulie lives with her family. They live in a special smart home with computers. She made the plan for the house herself.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6267 is well below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The secondary BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the 0.90 requirement, confirming a loss of key factual terms.\n\n- The original text establishes the subject as a 'leading researcher' in her field, a concept of high status and expertise. Your version weakens this to 'important researcher', which does not carry the same meaning of being at the top.\n- The phrase 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was replaced with 'good science magazines'. This is an unacceptable oversimplification that loses the critical meaning of academic quality and scientific validation.\n- The 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was reduced to 'a very important prize'. This loses specific factual information and the distinction between a prize and a fellowship, which is a significant alteration of the facts.\n\nSuggestion: The goal is simplification, not meaning erasure. Restore the concept of the subject being a 'top' or 'leading' expert. The simplification of complex terms like 'peer-reviewed journals' must still explain the concept, not just replace it with a vague, weaker term. Do not remove specific names of awards; simplify around them if necessary.",
