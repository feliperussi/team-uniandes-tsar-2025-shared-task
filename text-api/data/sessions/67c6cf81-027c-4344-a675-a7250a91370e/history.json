        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6267 is well below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The secondary BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the 0.90 requirement, confirming a loss of key factual terms.\n\n- The original text establishes the subject as a 'leading researcher' in her field, a concept of high status and expertise. Your version weakens this to 'important researcher', which does not carry the same meaning of being at the top.\n- The phrase 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was replaced with 'good science magazines'. This is an unacceptable oversimplification that loses the critical meaning of academic quality and scientific validation.\n- The 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was reduced to 'a very important prize'. This loses specific factual information and the distinction between a prize and a fellowship, which is a significant alteration of the facts.\n\nSuggestion: The goal is simplification, not meaning erasure. Restore the concept of the subject being a 'top' or 'leading' expert. The simplification of complex terms like 'peer-reviewed journals' must still explain the concept, not just replace it with a vague, weaker term. Do not remove specific names of awards; simplify around them if necessary."
