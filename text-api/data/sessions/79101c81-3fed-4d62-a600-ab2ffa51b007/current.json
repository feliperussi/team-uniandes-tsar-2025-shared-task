    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully simplifies the original content to a clear A2 level while passing all metric checks.\n\n- Sentence Structure: The original complex sentences were correctly broken down into short, simple sentences. The first long sentence was correctly split into three distinct ideas, which is a model simplification.\n- Vocabulary: All vocabulary is strictly within the A1-A2 range. The B1-level word 'connecting' was appropriately replaced with the A2 word 'link'.\n- Metrics: All metrics are well above the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.8669 and BERTScore at 0.9184 confirm high fidelity to the original message.\n- Clarity: The final output is exceptionally clear and easy for an A2 learner to understand. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
