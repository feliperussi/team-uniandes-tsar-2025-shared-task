    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8867 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates that too many key words and phrases from the original text were removed or over-simplified, damaging the text's fidelity.\n\n- Lexical Loss: The term 'planetary defence team' was reduced to 'planetary team'. The concept of 'defence' is critical and was lost.\n- Meaning Dilution: The original's 'achieve its goal' (finding the remaining NEOs) was simplified to 'find asteroids'. This loses the specific objective of completing a search.\n- Over-simplification: While simplification is necessary for A2, the aggressive reduction of phrases like 'work out how to defend' and 'being hit by' contributed to the low fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce key terms to meet the fidelity requirement. Change 'planetary team' to 'planetary defence team'. Combine the final two sentences to restore context: 'The team must protect the planet from truly worrying asteroids called PHAs.'",
