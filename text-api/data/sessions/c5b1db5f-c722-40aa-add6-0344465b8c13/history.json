        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.7047, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.885, which is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text establishes a clear dependency: 'Whether NASA can find... depends on getting the money'. Your version, 'NASA wants to find... It needs money', weakens this critical cause-and-effect relationship into two separate statements, altering the core meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The simplification of key terms was too aggressive, reducing fidelity. Replacing 'planetary defence team' with 'a team that keeps the planet safe' and 'defend the planet' with 'stop very bad asteroids' created too much lexical distance from the source text, causing the score to drop below the minimum.\n\n- Structural Issue: The sentence 'After that, a team that keeps the planet safe has more work' uses a defining relative clause ('that keeps the planet safe'). While simple, this structure is borderline B1 and should be avoided for strict A2 compliance. It could be simplified further.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the direct link between money and the ability to find asteroids. Rephrase using simpler cause-effect language like 'NASA needs money because it wants to find...'. Re-evaluate simplifications of key terms to stay closer to the original meaning; for example, 'protect the planet' is a better A2 simplification of 'defend the planet' than 'stop very bad asteroids'.",

Replace 'could work' with a phrase that captures the original meaning, such as 'could find the asteroids'. Replace the B1 word 'used' with 'for'. Replace the B1 word 'defence' with an A2 phrase like 'team that protects'. Rephrase the passive sentence into an active one, for example: 'NASA will use the money to build NEOCam'.",

This indicates an unacceptable loss of key phrasing and lexical precision from the original text due to oversimplification.\n\n- Deviation: The original concept 'work out how to defend the planet' was replaced with the vague and repetitive 'will have work. It will have more work.' This loses the core meaning of the team's task, which is problem-solving and planning a defense.\n\n- Deviation: The original phrase 'truly worrying asteroids' was simplified to 'very dangerous asteroids'. This replacement, while close in meaning, contributes to the overall drop in lexical fidelity measured by the BERTScore.\n\n- Deviation: The sentence 'a planetary team that protects the planet' uses a defining relative clause ('that protects...'). This is a B1-level grammatical structure and is too complex for the A2 standard.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the specific action of the planetary team. State that the team must 'find a way to protect the planet'.\n\n- Suggestion: Combine the two sentences 'It will have work.
