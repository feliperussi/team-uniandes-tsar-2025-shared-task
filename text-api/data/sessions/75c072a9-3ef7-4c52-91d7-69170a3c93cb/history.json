Example: 'The art world now says street art is a real type of art.' This phrasing is A2 compliant and more accurately reflects the original meaning.\n- Suggestion: The low BERTScore, while close, is a result of cumulative small changes.

The primary failure is the oversimplification of key concepts, which reduced lexical fidelity. The phrase 'giving more recognition to street art as a legitimate art form' was reduced to 'says street art is a real art'. This loses the specific concepts of 'recognition' and 'legitimate'. The word 'neighbourhood' was replaced with the more generic 'area', losing precision. The phrase 'in the future' was replaced with 'next', which is a less precise temporal marker in this context. While the text successfully achieves an A2 classification and preserves the general meaning, it does so by sacrificing too much of the original's specific vocabulary, causing the fidelity score to fall below the minimum requirement. Suggestion: Revise the text to re-introduce more precise vocabulary from the original while maintaining simple A2 sentence structures. The goal is to increase fidelity without increasing complexity. For instance, rephrase 'The art world now says street art is a real art' to something like 'The art world now accepts street art as a real kind of art'.",

For example, instead of 'thinks street art is a real art,' write 'The art world now says street art is a real type of art.' This phrasing is still A2 but is more faithful to the original meaning. Retain specific nouns like 'neighbourhood' when they do not violate A2 vocabulary constraints.",
