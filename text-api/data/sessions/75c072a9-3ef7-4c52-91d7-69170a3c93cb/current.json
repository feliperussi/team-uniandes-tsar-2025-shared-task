    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8889 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text due to overly aggressive simplification.\n\n- The phrase 'giving more recognition to street art as a legitimate art form' was oversimplified to 'More people in art world say street art is real art'. This loses the important concepts of 'recognition' and 'legitimacy'.\n- The concept of 'certain trends are emerging' was reduced to 'New things happen'. This is too vague and loses the original meaning.\n- The phrase 'art world' is grammatically incorrect. It must be 'the art world'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the core concepts while maintaining A2 simplicity. Instead of 'say street art is real art', use 'think street art is a real type of art'. Instead of 'New things happen', use 'Some new things are starting'. Correct the grammatical error.",
