The sentence structure is strong, effectively using connectors like 'that' and 'so' to build longer, coherent sentences (e.g., '...a management style that cares more about its people'). The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for the B1 level, successfully paraphrasing more complex ideas into clear, appropriate terms (e.g., 'positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'positive feedback and praise'). Factual accuracy is maintained perfectly, with all key points from the original text included. This is a high-quality example of B1 writing."
