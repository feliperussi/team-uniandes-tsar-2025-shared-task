    "text_translated": "Based on these results, we suggest that Girox Foods should use a management style that cares more about its people. As part of this, we should look for ways to offer working hours that can be changed and allow employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers also need to think about different ways to challenge their staff and give them more positive feedback and praise for their work. Finally, spending more on professional training could help create a positive environment so employees can do their best work, especially training in social skills and communication with people from different cultures.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent submission that clearly demonstrates B1-level writing competence. The text passes the preliminary metrics check and excels in the linguistic assessment. The sentence structure is strong, effectively using connectors like 'that' and 'so' to build longer, coherent sentences (e.g., '...a management style that cares more about its people'). The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for the B1 level, successfully paraphrasing more complex ideas into clear, appropriate terms (e.g., 'positive reinforcement and recognition' became 'positive feedback and praise'). Factual accuracy is maintained perfectly, with all key points from the original text included. This is a high-quality example of B1 writing.",
