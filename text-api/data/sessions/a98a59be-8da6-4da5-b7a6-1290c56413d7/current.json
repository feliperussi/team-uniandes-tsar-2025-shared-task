    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5788 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is an instant failure.\n\n- Core Message Distortion: The original text explicitly states the games are a form of 'punishment for rebelling'. Your version replaces this critical concept with weaker phrases like 'remind people about the past' and 'show that the Capitol is still in control'. This fundamentally changes the reason for the event and constitutes a severe loss of meaning.\n- Vocabulary: While the removal of the B1 word 'remind' was correct, the replacement did not carry the same weight or meaning.\n- Structure: The sentence structure and vocabulary choices are otherwise appropriate for the A2 level, but this cannot compensate for the failure to preserve the core message.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the concept of 'punishment'. Rephrase the section to communicate this idea in simple terms. For example: 'The Capitol uses the games to punish the other parts of the country because they fought the Capitol in the past.'",
