The severity and oppressive nature of the event are lost.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'district' was used. This is above the A2 level and was not simplified. An A2 text cannot contain unapproved B1 vocabulary.\n- Structural Simplification Error: The simplification of 'forced to watch' to 'must watch' also lessens the meaning. 'Forced' implies a lack of choice and control, which is central to the original's tone.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. The text must explicitly state that the games are a 'punishment'.
