This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Lost: Key terms were over-simplified, causing the score drop. The original's 'beloved jazz' was replaced with the generic 'favorite music'. The word 'chatter' was replaced with 'talking'. This loss of specific vocabulary is unacceptable.\n- Structural Degradation: The text has been broken into excessively short and unnatural sentences. The sequence 'Sounds included talking. There was TV.' is grammatically simple but stylistically poor and reads like a list, not a description.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore key lexical items from the original text. The word 'jazz' is A2-appropriate and must be retained for fidelity.\n- Suggestion: Combine overly fragmented sentences to create more natural A2-level structures. For example, 'The evening sounds were talking, the TV, and her dad's favorite jazz music.'",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, even though the core meaning was preserved.\n\n- Primary Cause: The text was over-simplified. The original, longer sentences were broken down into excessively short, choppy sentences. This fragmentation caused the loss of connecting words and phrasing, leading to the low fidelity score.\n- Example of Failure: The original sentence '...the house filled up with the evening sounds of chatter, television or her dad listening to his beloved jazz...' was broken into three separate, disconnected sentences. This lost the natural flow and specific phrasing like 'filled up'.\n- Lexical Loss: Minor but contributing word changes like replacing 'arrived' with 'came' and omitting 'later' and 'beloved' also reduced the fidelity score.\n- Structural Issue: While the text is correctly classified as A2, its structure is so simple it borders on A1. This extreme simplicity is the direct cause of the fidelity failure.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine some of the fragmented sentences to restore natural flow and lexical fidelity. The goal is simplification, not deconstruction. A sentence like 'The house would soon fill with sounds like chatter, the TV, and her dad's jazz music' is still A2 but is closer to the original's structure and vocabulary.",
