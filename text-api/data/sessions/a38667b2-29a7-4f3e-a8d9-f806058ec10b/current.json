The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Structural Simplification: The primary complex sentence from the original text was expertly deconstructed into several short, simple sentences. This is a model execution of A2 simplification principles.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels, with no deviations. This demonstrates perfect adherence to the A2 lexicon.\n\nNo corrective actions are required. The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",
