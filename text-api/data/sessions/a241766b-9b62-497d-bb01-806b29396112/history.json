        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6818 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original text's core message. The writer's output fails to convey the specific contribution of George Lucas as 'one of the early film directors to directly base his story on the 17 stages of the hero's journey'. Instead, it simplifies this to 'George Lucas made films. He used a special story idea. It is called 'the hero's journey.'', which loses the crucial nuance of Lucas's pioneering and detailed application of the concept. Additionally, the introductory definition 'An adventure is a new and exciting thing. It can be a bit dangerous.' is an unrequested addition that distracts from the original text's focus on the hero's journey narrative. The omission of 'to Obi-Wan Kenobi' from the message description also removes a specific factual detail from the original. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to clearly state George Lucas's significant role in using the detailed 'hero's journey' framework. Remove the extraneous definition of 'adventure'. Ensure all key factual details, such as the recipient of the message, are retained.",
