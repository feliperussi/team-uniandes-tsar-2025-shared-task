For example, are there genes that mutated and gave us the ability to speak? **Genes** are the instructions inside our bodies that decide how we grow. Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, which seems to be connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It is too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the retention of B2-level vocabulary and complex sentence structure. The verb 'undergo' is a B2 word and should have been simplified to a phrase like 'did not have this change'. Additionally, the sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, which seems to be connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' is too long and complex for a B1 level. To fix this, split this sentence into two or three shorter sentences. On a positive note, the text successfully preserved all facts and meaning, and the definition provided for the keyword 'genes' was clear and effective.",
