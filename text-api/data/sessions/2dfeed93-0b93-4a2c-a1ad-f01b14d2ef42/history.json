While the output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, the simplification was too aggressive. The sentence structures are very basic, and key verbs like 'mutated' were simplified to the more generic 'change'. This combination lowered the overall complexity too much. To reach the B1 level, try to use slightly more varied sentence structures. For example, instead of 'did a change in our genes give us the ability to speak?', you could write 'did our ability to speak come from a change in our genes?'. This maintains clarity while being more characteristic of the B1 level.",

The primary reason for this is the retention of B2-level vocabulary and complex sentence structure. The verb 'undergo' is a B2 word and should have been simplified to a phrase like 'did not have this change'. Additionally, the sentence 'Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, which seems to be connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' is too long and complex for a B1 level. To fix this, split this sentence into two or three shorter sentences. On a positive note, the text successfully preserved all facts and meaning, and the definition provided for the keyword 'genes' was clear and effective.",
