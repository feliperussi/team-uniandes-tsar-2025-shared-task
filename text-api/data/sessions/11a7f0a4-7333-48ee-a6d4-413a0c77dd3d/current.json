    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 CEFR readability standards and accurately conveys the original message. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8083 and BERTScore of 0.9003 confirm strong meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A1/A2 range, with no complex terms identified for replacement. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using A2-appropriate connectors like 'But' and 'So'. This is a well-executed simplification.",
