This indicates an oversimplification that sacrifices critical information.\n\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5945 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text describes 'accusations of various unethical acts' and 'growing consumer backlash' leading to a 'pact promising to transform packaging'. Your version simplifies this to 'did bad things' and 'people were angry', losing the nuance of formal accusations, organized public pressure, and a structured corporate response. The specific nature of the 'pact' and its 'transformation' goal is also diluted.\n*   Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8883 is below the required 0.90. Key terms and phrases from the original text, such as 'major supermarket chains', 'unethical acts', 'tonnes of food', 'suppliers', 'excessive plastic waste', 'environment', 'consumer backlash', 'pact', 'transform packaging', and 'cut plastic wastage', are either replaced with overly generic terms or omitted. For example, 'unethical acts' becomes 'bad things', 'suppliers' becomes 'farmers', and 'transform packaging and cut plastic wastage' becomes 'change how they pack food. They will use less plastic'. This results in a significant loss of specific lexical detail.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain more specific details and the formal nature of the original text's events, while still adhering to A2 vocabulary. For instance, 'accusations' could be 'people said supermarkets did bad things'. 'Consumer backlash' could be 'many people were very angry'. The 'pact' should be described as a more formal agreement, not just 'a promise'.",

MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics are below the required thresholds. This indicates a significant loss of information and precision. Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5955 is significantly below the required 0.75. The simplified language has stripped away too much nuance. For example, 'People said big supermarkets did bad things for ten years' is a very weak representation of 'supermarket chains have come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts over the past decade', losing the specific concepts of 'accusations' and 'unethical acts'. The phrase 'They understand' is too vague for 'starting to sit up and take notice' in the context of consumer backlash. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8908 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Terms like 'unethical acts', 'tonnes', 'suppliers', 'excessive plastic waste', 'packaging', 'environment', 'consumer backlash', 'pact', 'transform packaging', and 'cut plastic wastage' have been replaced with overly simplistic or generic phrases, diminishing the precision of the message. Suggestion: Reintroduce more specific vocabulary from the original text where possible, ensuring it remains within A2 comprehension. Focus on retaining the specific nature of the 'bad things' and the 'agreement'. Ensure the connection between 'consumer anger' and 'supermarkets listening' is clearer and more direct, as in the original 'In response to growing consumer backlash'.",

The A2 simplification process resulted in too many lexical deviations from the source material. For example: 1.

'over the past decade' was changed to 'for ten years'. 3. 'underpaid their suppliers' became 'did not pay their suppliers enough money'. 4. 'contributed to excessive plastic waste' became 'put too much plastic'. 5. 'growing consumer backlash' was simplified to 'Many buyers were very angry'. 6. 'cut plastic wastage' was changed to 'use less plastic'. These consistent lexical substitutions, while aiming for simplicity, collectively reduced the BERTScore below the acceptable threshold. Suggestion: While simplifying for A2, ensure that key nouns, verbs, and specific phrases are retained as much as possible, or replaced with very close synonyms, to maintain lexical fidelity.
