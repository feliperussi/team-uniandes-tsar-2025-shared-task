    "text_translated": "People from different places can act in different ways. It is good to know this because it helps us talk to people without problems. But we must be careful with this knowledge. We should not use stereotypes. Stereotypes are simple ideas about a group of people, and these ideas are often not true. Using stereotypes is bad for business and can stop good relationships. Many things make us who we are. Our country is one part. The place we live in is also important. The groups we know are important. Our age and if we are a man or a woman are important. The company we work for is important. Our own life is also important. So, remember that people can be different. But do not use this idea to think you know what a person is like before you meet them. Every person is different.",

It clearly states the failure reason ('Meaning Preservation Failure') and provides concrete evidence by contrasting the original's 'nuanced advice for a professional, business context' with the output's 'generic, elementary lesson'. The suggestion to 'Restore the professional context' and the example for simplifying 'pigeonholing' are highly constructive.",
