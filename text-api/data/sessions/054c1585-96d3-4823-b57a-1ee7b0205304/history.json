The simplification has removed the original text's strong sense of warning. The original uses words like 'detrimental' and 'pigeonhole' to emphasize the serious danger of stereotypes in business. Your version softens this to 'bad' and 'think all people... are the same', losing the core message about the damaging consequences of prejudice. The text also fails on CEFR compliance and vocabulary.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.5596 is unacceptable. The nuance and cautionary tone of the original text have been lost.\n*   **CEFR Compliance:** The classifier result is 'B1', not the required 'A2'. This is caused by sentence structures that are too complex for the A2 level.\n    *   Evidence 1: 'It is good to know that people can be different.' The use of a 'that-clause' is a B1 structure.\n    *   Evidence 2: 'The country we are from can change how we act and think.' The use of a 'how-clause' is a B1 structure.\n*   **Vocabulary Violation:** The word 'making' (B2) was used in 'making good business connections'. This is not an A2-level word.\n\nCorrective Path:\n\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase the text to restore the original's strong warning. Use simple A2 words to explain that stereotypes are very harmful and can break business relationships.\n*   **Suggestion:** Eliminate all B1 sentence structures. Split complex sentences. For example, 'It is good to know that people can be different' must be rewritten as 'People can be different. It is good to know this.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Remove the word 'making'. Replace the phrase with 'They are bad for good business connections.'"

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n*   **Meaning Loss:** The original text makes a nuanced argument: that awareness of cultural differences should be kept 'at the back of our minds' and not used to 'pigeonhole' people. Your output simplifies this to 'we must not think all people from a country are the same.' This loses the essential instruction on *how* to apply cultural knowledge subtly, which was the central point of the original argument.\n*   **CEFR Compliance Failure:** The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a secondary but critical failure. The repeated sentence structure 'The place we live is important' or 'The groups we are part of are important' uses an implied relative clause ('the place *that* we live in'), which is a B1-level grammatical structure. This structure is too complex for an A2 reader.\n\n**Corrective Path:**\n1.  **Restore Meaning:** You must rephrase the conclusion to capture the original's advice. Instead of just stating a fact, give a simple instruction. Suggestion: 'Think about these differences. But remember every person is different. Do not use one idea for all people from a country.'\n2.  **Simplify Structure:** Eliminate the B1-level sentence structures. Break them down into simpler forms. Suggestion: Instead of 'The place we live is important,' write 'Where we live is important.' or 'The place is important. We live there.'"

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The original text presents a nuanced argument: be aware of cultural differences but hold this knowledge in reserve, avoiding its use to 'pigeonhole' people. Your output over-simplifies this to a generic 'don't use stereotypes' message, losing the crucial balance and the specific warning against rigid categorization. This is a critical error.\n\nSecondary to this, the text fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n\n*   **Meaning Preservation:** The MeaningBERT score of 0.5409 provides quantitative proof that the central, sophisticated idea of the original was lost during simplification.\n*   **CEFR Compliance:** The classifier correctly rated the text as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n*   **Structural Violations:** The B1 classification is justified. The text is filled with grammatical structures that are too complex for the A2 level.

The message is not just 'stereotypes are bad'. It is 'understand that cultural differences might exist, but do not use this idea to judge one person.'\n*   **Deconstruct Sentences:** Eradicate all complex clauses identified above. Each idea must be in its own simple sentence. For example, instead of 'Where we live is also important,' you must write 'We live in a place. This place is also important.'
