        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, as indicated by the low MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6249 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text conveys an 'extraordinary story' of a boy 'shipwrecked' and 'trapped in a lifeboat' with a 'ferocious tiger'. Your version breaks this into many simple sentences, such as 'His boat sank. He was alone in a small boat. He was in the big ocean. This was very dangerous. A big, wild tiger was also in the boat with him.' This fragmentation loses the narrative impact and the specific, extraordinary nature of the predicament. The phrase 'This was very dangerous' is a weak and generic replacement for the detailed and specific danger described in the original. The BERTScore of 0.8982 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. For example, 'extraordinary story' was replaced with 'very special story', 'teenage boy' with 'young boy', 'shipwrecked' with 'boat sank', 'trapped in a lifeboat' with 'alone in a small boat', 'Pacific Ocean' with 'big ocean', 'ferocious tiger' with 'big, wild tiger', and 'diplomat' with 'father worked in other countries'. These replacements, while simpler, dilute the lexical richness and precision of the original text. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain the specific and 'extraordinary' nature of Pi's situation. Ensure key descriptive adjectives and nouns are retained or replaced with A2 equivalents that convey similar precision, rather than generic terms. Combine related ideas to avoid excessive fragmentation and improve narrative flow, while still adhering to A2 sentence structures.",

Your version fragments this into multiple short, disconnected sentences, such as 'The book is 'Life of Pi'. It tells an amazing story. It is about a young boy, Pi, from India. His ship broke in the Pacific Ocean. Pi was trapped in a small boat with a dangerous tiger.' This approach, while simplifying vocabulary, breaks the semantic flow and weakens the direct causal relationship between the events and the story's 'amazing' quality, which was central to the original's meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain a stronger connection between the story's nature and the events described, even with simple A2 structures. For example, combine related ideas using simple connectors like 'and' or 'because' to preserve the narrative's coherence.",

While the text is factually accurate and simplified to an A2 level, it fails to fully capture the core meaning and nuance of the original text. This is a critical deviation from the protocol.\n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The original's 'extraordinary story' was simplified to 'amazing story'. While 'amazing' is A2, 'extraordinary' conveys a stronger sense of uniqueness and wonder that is lost.\n- The original's 'ferocious tiger' was simplified to 'very dangerous tiger'. 'Ferocious' is a more specific and impactful adjective, and its replacement diminishes the intensity of the description.\n- The phrase 'finds himself trapped' in the original implies a more active or emergent situation. The simplification to 'was trapped' loses this subtle nuance of how Pi came to be in that situation.\n- The term 'diplomat' was simplified to 'worked for his country in other places'. While this is an A2 explanation, it loses the specific professional role and status implied by 'diplomat', thus reducing the fidelity of the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the intensity and specific meaning of key descriptive words. Consider how to convey the 'extraordinary' nature and the 'ferocious' quality without exceeding A2 vocabulary. Ensure that the simplified explanations for concepts like 'diplomat' retain as much of the original's specific meaning as possible.",

This indicates a significant loss of the core message and specific nuances from the original text. The original text conveyed a sense of the story's extraordinary nature, the intensity of the tiger's ferocity, and the specific official role of a diplomat. Your simplified version, while using simpler vocabulary, made these concepts more generic and less specific. For example, 'extraordinary story' was reduced to 'amazing story', losing the sense of something truly unique. 'Ferocious tiger' became 'fierce tiger', diminishing the intensity of the danger. Most significantly, 'diplomat' was simplified to 'father had an important job. He worked for his country in other places.', which is a broad description that fails to capture the specific international and official nature of a diplomat's role. Suggestion: Rephrase these sections to restore the specific meaning and intensity of the original concepts while maintaining A2 level vocabulary. For 'extraordinary story', consider phrases like 'a very special story, not like normal stories'. For 'ferocious tiger', use 'a very dangerous tiger'. For 'diplomat', aim for a more precise A2 explanation of the role, such as 'a person whose job is to work for their country in other countries to help them'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6592 is below the required 0.75. The text loses significant nuance and impact from the original. The BERTScore of 0.914 is acceptable, but the meaning loss is critical. The following specific deviations were identified: The phrase 'extraordinary story' was simplified to 'very special story', which diminishes the unique and remarkable quality of the original description. The adjective 'ferocious' describing the tiger was reduced to 'very wild', losing the intensity and danger implied in the original text. The specific professional role of 'diplomat' was generalized to 'father worked for his country in other countries'. While an A2 simplification, it loses the precise meaning of the original term. Suggestion: Rephrase to capture more of the original's descriptive power while remaining within A2 vocabulary. For example, consider 'a truly amazing story' instead of 'very special story', or 'a dangerous wild tiger' instead of 'very wild tiger'. Ensure that simplifications do not dilute the core descriptive meaning.",
