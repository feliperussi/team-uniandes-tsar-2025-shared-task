    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6592 is below the required 0.75. The text loses significant nuance and impact from the original. The BERTScore of 0.914 is acceptable, but the meaning loss is critical. The following specific deviations were identified: The phrase 'extraordinary story' was simplified to 'very special story', which diminishes the unique and remarkable quality of the original description. The adjective 'ferocious' describing the tiger was reduced to 'very wild', losing the intensity and danger implied in the original text. The specific professional role of 'diplomat' was generalized to 'father worked for his country in other countries'. While an A2 simplification, it loses the precise meaning of the original term. Suggestion: Rephrase to capture more of the original's descriptive power while remaining within A2 vocabulary. For example, consider 'a truly amazing story' instead of 'very special story', or 'a dangerous wild tiger' instead of 'very wild tiger'. Ensure that simplifications do not dilute the core descriptive meaning.",
