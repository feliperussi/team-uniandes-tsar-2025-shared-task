Since then, it has sold more than seven million copies all over the world, and it has also won many prizes and been translated into 41 languages.

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity was maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified texts. MeaningBERT (0.9236) and BERTScore (0.9789) metrics are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level.\n\nThe simplification strategy was effective and subtle. Lexical changes such as 'extraordinary' to 'amazing', 'teenage boy' to 'young boy', 'worldwide' to 'all over the world', and 'several prizes' to 'many prizes' are appropriate for a B1 audience, making the text more accessible without losing any nuance. The rephrasing of 'Martel is the son of a diplomat' to 'Martel's father was a diplomat' also contributes to clarity. While 'diplomat' is classified as C1, its context within the sentence is clear enough for a B1 reader, and the overall sentence structure remains simple, which is why the CEFR classifier correctly identified it as B1. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. This is a very well-executed simplification.",
