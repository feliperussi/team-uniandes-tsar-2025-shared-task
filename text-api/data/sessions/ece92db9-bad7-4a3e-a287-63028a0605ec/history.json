        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7203 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a subtle but significant loss of the original text's core message or emphasis. Specifically, the original text describes Pi as 'trapped in a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger', highlighting the extreme nature of his predicament. The simplified output states he 'finds himself in a lifeboat with a dangerous tiger'. The change from 'trapped' to 'in' and 'ferocious' to 'dangerous' reduces the intensity and the unique challenge of Pi's situation, which is central to the 'extraordinary story' mentioned in the original. While not a factual error, this dilution of intensity alters the core emotional and narrative impact. Additionally, the output adds a definition for 'diplomat' which, while helpful for simplification, was not part of the original's core message about Martel's background and slightly shifts the semantic focus.",

MeaningBERT (0.9236) and BERTScore (0.9789) metrics are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level.\n\nThe simplification strategy was effective and subtle. Lexical changes such as 'extraordinary' to 'amazing', 'teenage boy' to 'young boy', 'worldwide' to 'all over the world', and 'several prizes' to 'many prizes' are appropriate for a B1 audience, making the text more accessible without losing any nuance. The rephrasing of 'Martel is the son of a diplomat' to 'Martel's father was a diplomat' also contributes to clarity. While 'diplomat' is classified as C1, its context within the sentence is clear enough for a B1 reader, and the overall sentence structure remains simple, which is why the CEFR classifier correctly identified it as B1. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. This is a very well-executed simplification.",
