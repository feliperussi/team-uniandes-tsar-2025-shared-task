Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8743 is below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key lexical details.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text emphasizes 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and 'cultural norms and practices' leading to 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication' regarding 'business etiquette'. Your version simplifies this to 'business rules can be very different' and 'If you do not know these rules, there can be problems. You can think bad things about people. You can not understand each other. You can have problems talking.' This simplification loses the specific, nuanced meaning of cultural differences in business communication and their precise negative impacts.\n*   Fidelity Failure: Key terms from the original text were not adequately preserved. For example, 'international borders' was simplified to 'other countries', 'nuances and expectations' was reduced to 'business rules', and 'cultural norms and practices' and 'business etiquette' were both broadly replaced by 'rules' or 'rules for how to act in business'. This lexical simplification results in a loss of specific detail.\n*   Unnecessary Addition: The opening definition 'Culture is how people in a country do things. It is also how they think.' is an addition not present in the original text's core message. While defining keywords is acceptable, this specific placement and phrasing detracts from the primary focus of the original text, which is about business communication across cultures.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to more accurately convey the specific concepts of 'nuances', 'expectations', 'cultural norms', 'practices', and 'business etiquette' in a simplified A2 manner. Ensure that the consequences of not understanding these are clearly linked to 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication', rather than generic 'problems'.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6606 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's depth and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8922 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant deviation from the original's specific terminology and phrasing. While the text is simplified, it loses too much of the original's content. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6606 is too low. The original text emphasizes 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and 'cultural norms and practices' leading to 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies these to 'what people expect in business talk' and 'own ways to do business' and 'problems talking', which loses the specific, detailed meaning of the original. Deviation: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8922 is below the required 0.90. This is due to the replacement of key phrases such as 'conducted across international borders' with 'work with other countries', 'global business community' with 'Most business people', 'business acquaintances' being removed, and 'stand you in good stead' with 'help you a lot'. These replacements, while simpler, significantly reduce lexical overlap and precision. Deviation: Vocabulary. The word 'judge' is classified as B1. An A2 text must avoid vocabulary above the A2 level. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore the specific meaning of 'nuances', 'expectations', 'cultural norms', and 'breakdowns in communication' using A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Reintroduce key lexical items or their A2 equivalents to improve fidelity. Suggestion: Replace 'judge' with an A2 alternative such as 'think badly of' or 'make a bad opinion about'.",

The text also failed CEFR compliance. Lexical Deviation: The text consistently replaces original key terms with simpler synonyms or rephrased structures, which reduces lexical fidelity. For example, 'majority of the global business community' was replaced with 'Most people in business around the world', 'nuances' with 'small details', 'business communication' with 'talking in business', 'cultural norms and practices' with 'culture's ways and rules', 'unfair judgements' with 'bad judgements', 'breakdowns in communication' with 'Talking can stop', and 'business etiquette' with 'rules for good behaviour'. While these changes simplify the language, they deviate too much from the original phrasing for a high BERTScore. CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. While much of the vocabulary is at an A2 level, the sentence structures are occasionally too complex for a strict A2 classification. For instance, the sentence 'If you do not know these culture's ways and rules, you can make bad judgements about business acquaintances' combines an 'if' clause with a main clause and a long prepositional phrase, which pushes it beyond typical A2 sentence complexity. Similarly, 'There are three main differences in rules for good behaviour in business around the world' is also structurally dense for A2. Suggestion: To improve BERTScore, retain more of the original key vocabulary and phrasing where possible, while still simplifying grammar. To achieve A2 CEFR compliance, further simplify sentence structures. Break down longer sentences into multiple, very short sentences. Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2 or A1.",

While simplification is necessary for A2, it must not sacrifice the lexical fidelity to this extent. Specific deviations: The phrase 'majority of the global business community' was replaced with 'Most people in business around the world'. This loses the specific lexical detail of 'global business community'. The terms 'nuances' and 'communication' from 'nuances and expectations of business communication' were lost, replaced by 'how people talk in business'. Key terms like 'norms', 'practices', and 'acquaintances' from 'cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances' were replaced with 'rules and ways of business' and 'people you meet from other cultures'. This oversimplifies the original meaning. The idiomatic expression 'stand you in good stead' was replaced with 'help you a lot', which is a significant lexical deviation and loss of original phrasing. The term 'etiquette' from 'business etiquette' was replaced with 'business manners', which is acceptable for A2 but contributes to the overall lexical drift. Suggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification process to retain more of the original text's key vocabulary and phrasing where possible, even when simplifying sentence structures. Aim for a balance between A2 simplicity and lexical fidelity to the source. For example, 'global business community' could be simplified to 'business people around the world' to retain 'global' and 'community' concepts more closely. 'Business etiquette' can be simplified to 'business rules' or 'good business ways' but 'manners' is also acceptable. The main issue is the cumulative effect of many such changes.",

It is a common language.\nBut there are small ways of talking in business. What people expect in business communication is also different. This can be very different from culture to culture. Culture means the way a group of people live and think.\nIf you do not know the cultural ways and rules, problems can happen. This is with people you meet for business.\nYou might judge people wrongly. You might not understand them. It can cause communication problems.\nThere are three main parts of business rules. These are different around the world.\nKnowing them can help you very much. This is for when you work with people from other cultures.",

While simplification for A2 is necessary, this score indicates a significant loss of key words and specific factual phrasing from the original text. The text deviates too much lexically from the source. For example, 'majority of the global business community' was replaced with 'Most business people in the world', 'nuances' was lost, 'cultural norms and practices' became 'cultural ways and rules', 'business acquaintances' became 'people you meet for business', and 'business etiquette' became 'business rules'. These changes, while simplifying, reduce the lexical fidelity to the original. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain more of the original specific vocabulary where possible, while still simplifying sentence structure. For instance, 'cultural norms and practices' could be simplified to 'cultural rules and ways of doing things' to retain more of the original meaning and lexical content.",
