It is a common language.\nBut there are small ways of talking in business. What people expect in business communication is also different. This can be very different from culture to culture. Culture means the way a group of people live and think.\nIf you do not know the cultural ways and rules, problems can happen. This is with people you meet for business.\nYou might judge people wrongly. You might not understand them. It can cause communication problems.\nThere are three main parts of business rules. These are different around the world.\nKnowing them can help you very much. This is for when you work with people from other cultures.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8941 is below the required 0.90. While simplification for A2 is necessary, this score indicates a significant loss of key words and specific factual phrasing from the original text. The text deviates too much lexically from the source. For example, 'majority of the global business community' was replaced with 'Most business people in the world', 'nuances' was lost, 'cultural norms and practices' became 'cultural ways and rules', 'business acquaintances' became 'people you meet for business', and 'business etiquette' became 'business rules'. These changes, while simplifying, reduce the lexical fidelity to the original. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain more of the original specific vocabulary where possible, while still simplifying sentence structure. For instance, 'cultural norms and practices' could be simplified to 'cultural rules and ways of doing things' to retain more of the original meaning and lexical content.",
