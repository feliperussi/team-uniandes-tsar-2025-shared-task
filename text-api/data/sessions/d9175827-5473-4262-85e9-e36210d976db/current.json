    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6387 is too low, falling significantly below the required 0.75. The original text clearly states that engineers 'design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement', highlighting the specific engineering solution and its purpose. Your version separates the idea of 'Engineers learn to design bridges' from 'They build these bridges on strong land. This land does not move much in an earthquake', which weakens the direct causal link between the design choice and the land's resistance to movement. The core message about the specific engineering strategy for earthquake resistance is diluted. Suggestion: Rephrase the section about engineers to more directly connect the design process with the choice of resistant land, ensuring the purpose of the design is clear.",
