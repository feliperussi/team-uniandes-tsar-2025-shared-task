The writer's output introduces a definition of 'earthquake' ('An 'earthquake' is when the ground shakes a lot.') which is not present in the original text. The original text immediately discusses the effects and mitigation of earthquakes, assuming prior knowledge of what an earthquake is. Adding this definition fundamentally alters the core message and intent of the original source material. This is a direct violation of factual integrity and fidelity to the source. \n\nAdditionally, the text fails on critical metrics:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5621 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original message's nuance, particularly regarding the specific engineering solutions and the concept of 'earthquake zones' and 'areas resistant to movement'.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8746 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical details from the original, such as 'structures', 'collapse', 'relatively infrequent', 'modern bridges', 'earthquake zones', and 'resistant to movement', have been replaced with overly simplistic or less precise terms like 'many things', 'fall down often', 'new bridges', 'strong', and 'stop the shaking'.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the introductory definition.

The original text states engineers design bridges to be 'much more resistant to movement'. Your output simplifies this to 'Engineers make these bridges strong.

The core message about a specific design strategy for enhanced resistance is not fully preserved. The BERTScore of 0.8988 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a failure to retain key lexical information. The phrase 'much more resistant to movement' from the original is not adequately represented, leading to a loss of fidelity.

While 'earthquake zones' is defined, the base word 'earthquake' itself is used multiple times without an A2 equivalent. Suggestion: Rephrase the section about engineers' actions to explicitly state that they design bridges to resist movement.

For example, 'Engineers build bridges that fight the shaking ground very well.' or 'Engineers make bridges that do not shake much, even when the ground moves a lot.'

The BERTScore of 0.8967 is also below the required 0.90, showing a loss of key lexical detail. This failure at Priority 2 is critical. The CEFR classifier rating of A2 is irrelevant given these fundamental issues. \n\n*   Meaning Preservation: The original text's primary focus is on how engineers design bridges to be resistant to earthquake movement. Your version introduces a general definition of earthquakes and then oversimplifies the engineers' role to merely 'choosing places', losing the crucial concept of 'designing bridges... on areas that are much more resistant to movement'. The core message about proactive engineering design for resistance is diluted. \n*   Lexical Fidelity: Key terms and phrases from the original text were not adequately preserved or replaced with sufficiently precise A2 equivalents. For example, 'damage all structures' was replaced with 'break buildings. They can break bridges too', which adds 'buildings' and loses the generality of 'all structures'. 'Relatively infrequent' was simplified to 'not fall down often', losing the nuance of 'relatively'. 'Modern bridges' became 'New bridges'. Crucially, 'Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement' was reduced to 'Engineers know how to make bridges. They choose places for bridges. These places do not shake much', losing the specific concepts of 'learned', 'design', 'earthquake zones', and 'resistant to movement'. \n*   Unnecessary Information: The opening sentence 'Earthquakes are when the ground shakes' is a definition not present in the original text and detracts from the main subject of bridge design and safety. \n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the original text to identify its precise main point. Ensure your A2 version directly conveys this main point without adding extraneous information. Restore the concept of engineers actively 'designing' bridges to be 'resistant' to movement, using appropriate A2 vocabulary.

The text also exhibits several other deviations from the A2 standard. Specific issues include: The original text states 'all structures', but your version changes this to 'many buildings', which alters the scope and generality of the statement. The specific term 'collapse' from the original was replaced with the more general phrase 'fall down', losing precision. The nuance of 'Engineers have learned to design' was simplified to 'Engineers build', which omits the concept of acquired knowledge and refined engineering. The phrase 'much more resistant to movement' was weakened to 'do not move much', reducing the strength of the resistance concept. Suggestion: Restore the original scope of 'all structures'. Use a more precise A2 equivalent for 'collapse'. Rephrase to convey the idea of engineers learning and designing for resistance.",

The core message regarding the engineers' specific design strategy for bridges in earthquake zones has been diluted. The original text emphasizes 'Engineers have learned to design bridges in earthquake zones on areas that are much more resistant to movement,' implying a sophisticated design process for the structures themselves in relation to the ground. Your version simplifies this to 'Engineers learn to design new bridges. They choose parts of the land. These parts are strong. They do not move easily in an earthquake.' This shifts the focus primarily to land selection rather than the engineering design of the bridge structure for resistance, and the phrase 'do not move easily' is weaker than 'much more resistant to movement'. The nuance of the engineers' active role in making the *bridges* resistant is lost. Suggestion: Rephrase to clearly state that engineers design the bridges themselves to be strong against movement when built on certain land.",
