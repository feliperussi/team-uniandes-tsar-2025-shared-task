    "text_translated": "Lewis would like to increase the number of protected areas in the sea from 3 to 10 per cent, because he wants to fix the damage that is caused by human activities like overfishing, pollution and leaving rubbish. During his journeys, Lewis has seen this damage to nature with his own eyes. He has swum over coral reefs, which are underwater structures made by small animals, that have turned white because the water is warmer. He has also seen underwater deserts in the Red Sea which have no life and are covered in plastic. Pugh believes that nature can get better if we give it the space to do so, but he thinks we are running out of time. If we don't start taking care of our seas, we may soon have a problem that is impossible to solve.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary submission that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all key figures and actions accurately represented. The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.94 are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy was executed flawlessly; complex concepts like 'bleached' were simplified to 'turned white', and the idiom 'the clock is ticking' was effectively rephrased as 'we are running out of time'. Most impressively, the keyword 'coral reefs' was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence flow, serving as a model for how to handle required definitions. The final text is clear, fluent, and perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
