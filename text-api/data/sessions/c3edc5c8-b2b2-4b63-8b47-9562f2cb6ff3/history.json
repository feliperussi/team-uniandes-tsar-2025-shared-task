During his journeys, Lewis has seen this damage to nature with his own eyes. He has swum over coral reefs, which are underwater structures made by small animals, that have turned white because the water is warmer. He has also seen underwater deserts in the Red Sea which have no life and are covered in plastic. Pugh believes that nature can get better if we give it the space to do so, but he thinks we are running out of time. If we don't start taking care of our seas, we may soon have a problem that is impossible to solve.",

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct, accurately reflecting all key data and events from the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.79 and BERTScore of 0.94 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details have been preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The qualitative analysis is also very strong. The vocabulary substitutions are highly effective, for example, simplifying 'the clock is ticking' to 'we are running out of time' and 'witnessed... first-hand' to 'seen... with his own eyes'. Most notably, the handling of the keyword 'coral reefs' is exemplary; embedding a simple definition directly into the sentence ('which are underwater structures made by small animals') is a perfect strategy for a B1 audience. The final text is clear, accurate, and flows naturally.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.81 and BERTScore of 0.94 are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy was executed flawlessly; complex concepts like 'bleached' were simplified to 'turned white', and the idiom 'the clock is ticking' was effectively rephrased as 'we are running out of time'. Most impressively, the keyword 'coral reefs' was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence flow, serving as a model for how to handle required definitions. The final text is clear, fluent, and perfectly suited for a B1 audience.",
