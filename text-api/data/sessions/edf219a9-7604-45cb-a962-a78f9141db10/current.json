    "text_translated": "This horror film clich\u00e9 was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It usually begins with a group of teenagers who are enjoying themselves, yet it concludes with everyone dead apart from one girl. At the beginning, this girl is often innocent, shy, and not particularly strong. However, by the end of the film, she has become the toughest and most practical person, able to find solutions. This girl almost always wins in the end.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.915) and BERTScore (0.9672) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the text flows well, utilizing B1 connectors such as 'yet' and 'However' to improve cohesion and sentence variety. The simplification of 'resourceful' to 'practical, able to find solutions' is a particularly effective strategy for B1 learners, making the concept more accessible. While 'except' (A1) was changed to 'apart from' (B1) and 'ends' (A1) to 'concludes' (A2), these changes remain within the B1 range and contribute to a more varied and sophisticated B1 vocabulary without overcomplicating the text. The removal of 'in the world' is a minor but acceptable simplification. Overall, this is a very strong simplification.",
