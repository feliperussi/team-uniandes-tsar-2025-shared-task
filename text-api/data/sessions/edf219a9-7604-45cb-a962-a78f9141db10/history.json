It usually begins with a group of teenagers who are enjoying themselves, but then everyone dies except for one girl. At the beginning, this girl is often good, shy, and not very strong. However, by the end of the film, she has become the strongest and most clever person, and this last girl nearly always wins.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the required B1 level. The simplification strategy led to an overall reduction in lexical complexity and sentence structure that pushed the text below the B1 threshold. For example, the original term 'clich\u00e9' was simplified to 'story', 'innocent' to 'good', 'toughest' to 'strongest', and 'resourceful' to 'clever'. While these are simpler, they are predominantly A1/A2 level vocabulary. Additionally, the sentence structures, such as 'but then everyone dies' and the use of 'and this last girl nearly always wins' as a simple additive clause, contribute to an A2 classification. To achieve B1, the text needs to retain slightly more complex vocabulary and sentence structures, while still being accessible. For instance, consider using 'trope' instead of 'clich\u00e9', or retaining 'innocent' if appropriate, and finding B1 synonyms for 'toughest' and 'resourceful' that are not A2.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.915) and BERTScore (0.9672) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the text flows well, utilizing B1 connectors such as 'yet' and 'However' to improve cohesion and sentence variety. The simplification of 'resourceful' to 'practical, able to find solutions' is a particularly effective strategy for B1 learners, making the concept more accessible. While 'except' (A1) was changed to 'apart from' (B1) and 'ends' (A1) to 'concludes' (A2), these changes remain within the B1 range and contribute to a more varied and sophisticated B1 vocabulary without overcomplicating the text. The removal of 'in the world' is a minor but acceptable simplification. Overall, this is a very strong simplification.",
