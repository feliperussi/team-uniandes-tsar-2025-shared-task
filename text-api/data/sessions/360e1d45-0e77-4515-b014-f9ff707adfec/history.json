Your version, 'new tools helped children live longer. Health also,' breaks this critical link into two disconnected statements, fundamentally altering the logic of the text.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.889 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing precise terminology with vague approximations. The phrase 'global average number' was replaced with 'world\u2019s usual number', which is not an equivalent concept. Key lexical items like 'improvements' and 'availability' were completely lost.\n\n- Structural Defect: The sentence 'Health also.' is a fragment. While simple, it is grammatically incomplete and demonstrates a failure to construct a proper A2 sentence.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the first two sentences to restore the cause-and-effect relationship. Example: 'Because of better tools and health, more children lived for a long time.' Suggestion: Restore the meaning of 'global average'. Use 'the average number for the whole world'.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The sentence 'Those children grew up6.' contains a numerical error. The number '6' is incorrect and corrupts the meaning of the sentence. Adherence to factual integrity is the absolute first priority; this error constitutes an instant failure.\n\nIn addition to the primary failure, the text also fails on a secondary metric.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.897 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a loss of key lexical detail. The concept 'survived into adulthood' was oversimplified to 'grew up', contributing to this score drop.\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is excessively fragmented. The sequence 'Big families had many children. Those children grew up. They had children.' breaks a single, connected idea from the original text into three choppy, disconnected statements.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the numerical error immediately. Combine the fragmented sentences to restore the original's logical flow using a simple connector. Rephrase to improve fidelity. Example: 'These big families had many children, and those children grew up to have their own families.'",

The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with this level.\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 words. Terms like 'technology', 'population', and 'birth control' are appropriate for the A2 level.\n- Structural Analysis: The use of short, simple sentences connected by basic conjunctions like 'so' and 'and' is an exemplary execution of A2 structural requirements. The text is clear and easy to follow.",
