The word 'tags' (referring to graffiti) is generally considered to be B1 or higher. An A2 learner would likely not understand this specific term without context or definition. The task requires strict adherence to A2 vocabulary. While the MeaningBERT score (0.7817), BERTScore (0.93), and CEFR classifier result (A2) are acceptable, a single non-A2 word constitutes a failure in a rigorous audit.

The original text specified 'identical twin brothers' and 'paint everything from tags to huge, colourful pictures'. Your version omits 'identical' and simplifies 'everything from tags' to 'small drawings', which, while an A2 simplification, slightly reduces the fidelity of the original's specific examples and comprehensive scope.\n\nSuggestion: Ensure all key descriptive adjectives and specific examples, even when simplified, retain their original intent.
