    "text_translated": "Wasfia Nazreen was a small girl. She saw a hula hoop for the first time. (A hula hoop is a toy ring.) A child from another country was visiting Bangladesh. The child was playing with the hula hoop. Wasfia wanted to play. But girls in her country did not play with hula hoops. People believed this. Girls also did not ride bikes. So, Wasfia watched. She did not like to just watch.\n\nNow, Wasfia is a woman. She climbed the Seven Summits. These are very high mountains. Everest and Kilimanjaro are two of them. Only a few people in the world did this. She was the first to use a hula hoop on every mountain. She did this for women and girls. She wants them to feel strong. In her country, people do not want girls to do sport. She wants to change this.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6616 is below the required 0.75. The core message of the original text, specifically Wasfia's reason for her actions, has been significantly diluted. The original states her reason is \"to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.\" Your version simplifies this to \"She wants them to feel strong. In her country, people do not want girls to do sport. She wants to change this.\" The critical concept of \"empower\" (to give power or authority) is not adequately conveyed by \"feel strong.\" While feeling strong is a result, it is not the act of empowerment itself. Furthermore, \"discourages them from doing sport\" is a more specific and active concept than \"people do not want girls to do sport.\" The overall impact and purpose are weakened. Suggestion: Rephrase the purpose to more accurately reflect the act of empowerment and the specific nature of the discouragement, using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of \"She wants them to feel strong,\" consider \"She wants to help women and girls have more power\" or \"She wants to help women and girls be strong and make their own choices.\" For \"people do not want girls to do sport,\" consider \"people tell girls not to do sport.\"",
