        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.666 is too low, falling significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The primary reason for this failure is the introduction of new information at the beginning of the text, specifically the definition of 'A hula hoop is a big ring. You put it around your body and move it.' This content is not present in the original text and alters the initial focus and meaning by shifting the introduction from Wasfia's personal experience to a general object definition. Additionally, the nuance of 'reluctantly stood by and watched' from the original is not fully captured by 'Wasfia just watched. She did not want to just watch.', which loses the implication of external pressure or internal hesitation due to societal norms. The strong concept of 'empower women and girls' is also diluted to 'help women and girls', which, while simpler, does not convey the full depth of the original's message of active agency against societal barriers. The text also includes the phrase 'people thought this: Girls must not play with hula hoops. Girls must not ride bikes.' The use of 'this:' is an awkward and non-standard construction for A2. Suggestion: Remove the introductory definition of the hula hoop. Rephrase 'She did not want to just watch' to better reflect the 'reluctantly' aspect, perhaps by stating 'She had to watch, but she did not like it.' Rephrase 'help women and girls' to convey a stronger sense of empowerment, possibly 'make women and girls strong' or 'give women and girls power'. Correct the awkward 'people thought this:' construction to a more natural A2 phrasing like 'people thought that girls must not play...'",

While the factual information is present, the core message and nuance of the original text have been diluted. The simplification has resulted in a loss of the deeper meaning regarding Wasfia's motivation and the societal context. Specific deviations include:\n\n1.  Meaning Loss: The phrase 'to empower women and girls' from the original text is simplified to 'She wants to make women and girls strong'. While 'make strong' is an A2 phrase, it fails to capture the full meaning of 'empower', which implies giving power, confidence, or authority, not just physical strength. This significantly weakens the purpose of Wasfia's actions.\n2.  Meaning Loss: The original 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' is simplified to 'In her country, people say girls should not do sport'. 'Discourages' implies an active societal or cultural barrier and opposition, whereas 'people say' is a passive statement of belief that does not convey the same level of active hindrance or pressure. This diminishes the challenge Wasfia is addressing.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the purpose to more accurately reflect the concept of 'empowerment' in A2 terms, perhaps by focusing on giving girls confidence or the freedom to choose. Rephrase the societal context to convey active 'discouragement' more clearly, such as 'people stop girls from doing sport' or 'it is hard for girls to do sport'.",

Additionally, 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' is simplified to 'In her country, people stop girls from doing sport'. 'Discourages' implies a societal pressure or lack of encouragement, whereas 'stop' suggests a more direct and absolute prohibition. This changes the nature of the challenge Wasfia is addressing. Suggestion: Rephrase the motivation to better reflect the active sense of 'empowerment' at an A2 level, perhaps by using 'She wants to help women and girls be strong and free'.

The core message of Wasfia's personal journey, specifically the nuance of her 'reluctantly' watching and the societal 'discouragement' that directly links to her current 'empowerment' mission, is not fully captured. The simplified text presents facts but loses some of the emotional and causal depth of the original narrative. For example, 'reluctantly stood by and watched' is simplified to 'She wanted to play, but she did not', which loses the nuance of societal pressure. Additionally, the word 'spin' used in the definition of 'hula hoop' ('You spin it around your body') is classified as C1, which is too advanced for an A2 text. This is a direct vocabulary violation. Suggestion: Rephrase the section about Wasfia's childhood to better convey the feeling of reluctance and the societal pressure she faced. Ensure the connection between her past experience and her current mission is more explicit. Replace the word 'spin' with a simpler A2 verb or phrase, such as 'move it quickly' or 'turn it'.",

Your version 'She wanted to play with it. But girls in her country could not play with hula hoops. People believed this. So, Wasfia just watched. She did not want to just watch.' simplifies this to a direct desire versus an inability, losing the nuance of 'reluctance' and the deeper societal pressure. The original 'empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' conveys a systemic issue. Your version 'She wants them to feel strong. She wants them to have power. In her country, people tell girls not to do sport. She wants to change this.' simplifies 'discourages' to direct instruction ('people tell girls not to do sport'), weakening the systemic impact and the core message of her activism. Suggestion: Restore the nuance of 'reluctantly' to reflect the internal conflict. Rephrase the reason for her actions to more accurately reflect the systemic nature of 'discourages' rather than simple direct telling, ensuring the full weight of her mission is preserved.",

The child was playing with the hula hoop. Wasfia wanted to play. But girls in her country did not play with hula hoops. People believed this. Girls also did not ride bikes. So, Wasfia watched. She did not like to just watch.\n\nNow, Wasfia is a woman. She climbed the Seven Summits. These are very high mountains. Everest and Kilimanjaro are two of them. Only a few people in the world did this. She was the first to use a hula hoop on every mountain. She did this for women and girls. She wants them to feel strong. In her country, people do not want girls to do sport. She wants to change this.",

The core message of the original text, specifically Wasfia's reason for her actions, has been significantly diluted. The original states her reason is \"to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.\" Your version simplifies this to \"She wants them to feel strong. In her country, people do not want girls to do sport. She wants to change this.\" The critical concept of \"empower\" (to give power or authority) is not adequately conveyed by \"feel strong.\" While feeling strong is a result, it is not the act of empowerment itself. Furthermore, \"discourages them from doing sport\" is a more specific and active concept than \"people do not want girls to do sport.\" The overall impact and purpose are weakened. Suggestion: Rephrase the purpose to more accurately reflect the act of empowerment and the specific nature of the discouragement, using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of \"She wants them to feel strong,\" consider \"She wants to help women and girls have more power\" or \"She wants to help women and girls be strong and make their own choices.\" For \"people do not want girls to do sport,\" consider \"people tell girls not to do sport.\"",
