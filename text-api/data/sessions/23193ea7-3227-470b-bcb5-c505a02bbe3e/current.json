    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7128 is below the 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8867 is below the 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and specific terminology. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that does not adequately represent the source material.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing key original terms. Words like 'leading', 'Robotics and AI', 'peer-reviewed', 'international conferences', and 'prestigious' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same weight or specificity. This damages the factual precision of the text.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The low MeaningBERT score shows that the core message about the subject's high status and specific achievements was diluted. 'Leading researcher' becoming 'very important researcher' loses the concept of being at the forefront of a field.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text includes the words 'royal' (B1) and 'academy' (C1). These words are above the A2 level. Their inclusion, even as part of a proper name, is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. You must find A2-level phrasing that more closely preserves the meaning of the original's key terms. The goal is to increase both the MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics above their respective thresholds without introducing B1-level vocabulary or sentence structures.",
