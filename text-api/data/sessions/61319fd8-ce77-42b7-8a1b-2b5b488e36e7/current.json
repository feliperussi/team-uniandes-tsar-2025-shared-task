    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8942 is below the required 0.90. This is because the phrase 'make predictions about possible impact' was simplified to 'guess if one could hit Earth', losing key technical wording, and 'defence solutions could be launched' was reduced to 'stop an asteroid in two ways', omitting 'defence'. Suggestion: Restore the original phrasing for precision, including 'make predictions about possible impact' and 'defence solutions could be launched'.",
