    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6674 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8404 is also below the minimum 0.90, confirming a significant loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text discusses 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'. Your version, 'how they see problems in work' and 'how they see good things in work', is an oversimplification that loses the nuance of perception and complexity. This is the primary cause of the low score.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items from the original text such as 'global survey', 'participated in a study', and 'perceptions' were completely removed. This loss of fidelity to the source is unacceptable.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text B1, not the required A2. This is a direct result of using unsimplified B1 and B2 vocabulary. The words 'workplace', 'communication', 'development', and 'balance' are not A2-level terms and must be rephrased.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is a series of disconnected, robotic sentences. While avoiding complex structures, this fragmentation damages readability and contributes to the loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the original meaning regarding 'perceptions of threats and opportunities'. Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary with A2-level explanations. For example, 'workplace culture' must become 'how people feel at work'. 'Communication' must become 'how people talk to each other'. Combine some of the repetitive sentences using 'and' to create a more natural flow.",
