The BERTScore of 0.8728 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message and lexical content.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5293 shows that the core meaning was lost. The original text is about two specific, large-scale corporate surveys. Your output oversimplifies this to 'a big company that does research', which loses the formality and significance of the original message.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8728 reflects an excessive replacement of key terms. Replacing 'millennial and non-millennial responses' and 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities' with much simpler phrases created too much distance from the source text's specific vocabulary.\n\n- Over-simplification: While the text achieves an A2 classification, it does so by sacrificing essential information and nuance. The goal is to simplify, not to strip the text of its core purpose.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to preserve more of the original meaning. Do not reduce the concept of a 'global survey' to just 'a survey all over the world'. Retain key terms like 'millennial' and provide a simple definition. The simplification of the Deloitte survey's purpose from 'perceptions of threats and opportunities' to 'how they see problems and chances' is too drastic and must be revised to be more faithful to the source.",

Your output, 'problems at work and about good things at work', is a gross oversimplification that fails to capture the meaning of 'perceptions' and 'opportunities'.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: Key lexical items from the original text such as 'workplace culture', 'career development', and 'work-life balance' were completely lost. Your replacements are too generic and do not maintain fidelity to the source material.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The B1 word 'communication' was used directly. This is unacceptable.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'communication' must be replaced. It is not A2-compliant.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. You must restore the original meaning using only A2 vocabulary and structures. Replace 'communication' with an A2 phrase like 'how people talk to each other'. Rephrase the section about the Deloitte survey to better reflect the concepts of 'threats' and 'opportunities' without using those specific words. For example: 'The survey asked what millennials think is difficult or bad for their jobs, and what they think is helpful or good for their jobs in the future.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary failure is a catastrophic loss of meaning and fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7018 is well below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8694 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates that your simplification has removed too much of the original text's core message and key vocabulary. A secondary, but also critical, failure is the CEFR compliance. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.7018 shows a failure to preserve the original meaning. The original text mentions a study about millennials' 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'. Your version, 'threats and opportunities for their jobs', is an oversimplification that loses the crucial concepts of 'perception' and 'complexity'.\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8694 confirms a significant loss of key words. Terms like 'responses', 'participated', and 'perceptions' were completely removed, damaging the text's fidelity to the source.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is rated B1. This is unacceptable. The cause is the direct use of B1 and B2 vocabulary without simplification.\n- Vocabulary Violation: You used the words 'global' (B1), 'communication' (B1), 'development' (B1), 'balance' (B1), and 'workplace' (B2). These words are not on the A2 list and must be replaced.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary immediately. 'Global' must be changed to 'in many countries'. 'Workplace culture' must be rephrased to something like 'how people work together'. 'Career development' must be simplified to 'getting a better job in the future'.\n- Restore the lost meaning. The text must explain that the Deloitte survey was about what young people *think* or *feel* about problems and good things at work.",
