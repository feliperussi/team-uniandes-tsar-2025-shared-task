Baboons are a type of wild animal. They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards. Some baboons are not afraid. They even go into people's houses and take food from kitchen cupboards and fridges. Baboons can be dangerous. They are attacking pet animals. Because of this, many people in the city do not want the baboons there.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.8331 and BERTScore at 0.9612 confirm excellent meaning and lexical preservation. The CEFR_Classifier_Result is correctly identified as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly A2. The simplification of 'aggressive' to 'dangerous' and 'brave' to 'not afraid' is correct and effective. The B1 word 'edge' is acceptable in the common collocation 'edge of the city'.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences connected by appropriate A2-level conjunctions ('and', 'Because of this'). The structure is a model of A2 clarity.\n- Simplification Strategy: The addition of the sentence 'Baboons are a type of wild animal' serves as an effective in-text definition, which is an exemplary A2 technique. No deviations were found.",
