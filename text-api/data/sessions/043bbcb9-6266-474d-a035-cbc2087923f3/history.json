The text fails to capture the core message of the original.\n\n- The primary failure is a loss of meaning. The original text describes a human-animal conflict and a specific problem for residents. Your version is a simple, neutral description of animal behavior, which is not the same message.\n\n- The simplification of key concepts was too extreme. Changing 'aggressive' to 'angry' and 'attacked' to 'hurt' weakens the sense of danger and conflict that is central to the original text's meaning.\n\n- You added new information. The sentence 'Baboons are a type of big monkey' was not in the original text. Adding external facts, even for simplification, is a deviation that dilutes the source message and contributed to the low meaning score.\n\n- The causal link is weak. The original's 'so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence' strongly connects the baboons' aggression to the residents' feelings. Your version, 'So, many people in the city are not happy', is a much weaker statement.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to focus on the concept of a 'problem'. Do not add information that was not in the original source. Restore the strong connection between the animals' actions and the residents' negative reaction.",

Additionally, the words 'on the edge of the city' and 'orchards' were removed, reducing the text's descriptive detail. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore the original meaning of a recent and ongoing event. Use phrases like 'are now coming' instead of just 'come'.

The CEFR_Classifier_Result is correctly identified as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly A2. The simplification of 'aggressive' to 'dangerous' and 'brave' to 'not afraid' is correct and effective. The B1 word 'edge' is acceptable in the common collocation 'edge of the city'.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text uses short, simple sentences connected by appropriate A2-level conjunctions ('and', 'Because of this'). The structure is a model of A2 clarity.\n- Simplification Strategy: The addition of the sentence 'Baboons are a type of wild animal' serves as an effective in-text definition, which is an exemplary A2 technique.
