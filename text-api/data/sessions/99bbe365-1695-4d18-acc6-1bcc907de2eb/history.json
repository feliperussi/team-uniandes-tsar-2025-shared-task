First, the sentence 'The next step could be autonomous murder\u2011bots, which are robots that can decide by themselves who to kill, even though they only follow orders' is too complex. It combines multiple clauses (a relative clause with 'which' and a concession clause with 'even though'), a structure more typical of B2. Suggestion: Split this into two or three simpler sentences. Second, the C1-level vocabulary word 'cautious' was kept from the original text. It should have been replaced with a simpler B1 alternative, such as 'careful'. Correcting these two points would likely bring the text to the required B1 level.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The submission alters the core logic of the original text's central warning. The original text states that murderbots are dangerous because they are \"following orders but ultimately deciding who to kill on their own.\" The word \"but\" is critical, as it highlights the dangerous conflict between the two actions. Your output separates this into two sentences: \"These are robots that can decide who to kill on their own. They only follow orders.\" This phrasing removes the conflict and creates a logical contradiction, fundamentally misrepresenting the nature of the threat. A better phrasing would be: \"Even though they follow orders, they can still decide for themselves who to kill.\" Additionally, the submission fails on CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B2, not the required B1. This is because it uses grammatical structures that are too complex for the B1 level, specifically the parenthetical clause in the first sentence and the semicolon in the second. To meet the B1 requirement, these should be replaced with simpler, separate sentences.",

The primary reason for this is likely the use of the B2-level word 'unethical' and the structurally complex sentence, 'Military machines such as drones, gun turrets and sentry robots already kill with only a small amount of human control.' To correct this, replace 'unethical' with a simpler phrase like 'morally wrong' or 'not right'. Also, split the long sentence into two for better readability at the B1 level. For example: 'Military machines like drones and gun turrets already kill people. They do this with only a small amount of human control.'
