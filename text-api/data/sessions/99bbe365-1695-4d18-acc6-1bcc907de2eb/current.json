Forget the scary movie picture of a Terminator crushing people. Look at what is happening now. Military machines like drones and gun turrets already kill people. They do this with only a small amount of human control. The next step could be autonomous murderbots. Autonomous murderbots are robots that can decide who to kill on their own. These robots follow orders, but they can still decide for themselves who to kill. This is clearly not right and it is dangerous for people, so we must be very careful about what we ask machines to do.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and aligns perfectly with the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.86 and BERTScore of 0.93 are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved the target B1 level. The handling of the specific tasks was exemplary. The keywords 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots' and 'autonomous murderbots' were defined clearly and integrated naturally into the text. The strategy of breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones was highly effective for the target audience. Vocabulary simplification, such as changing 'unethical' to 'not right', was also very well done. The work is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of B1 simplification principles.",
