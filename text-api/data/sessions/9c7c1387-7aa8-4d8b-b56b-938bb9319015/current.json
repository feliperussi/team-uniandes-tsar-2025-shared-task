    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards. No deviations were found. Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers, names, and the core message from the original text are accurately preserved. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8649 (above the required 0.75) confirms excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9218 (above the required 0.90) indicates strong lexical fidelity to the original. CEFR Compliance: The CEFR classifier correctly rated the text as A2. Qualitative Audit: Vocabulary: All vocabulary used is appropriate for the A2 level. The word 'hunger' is part of a proper noun ('The Hunger Games') and is therefore exempt from the general vocabulary level assessment for simplification. Structure: The text uses short, simple sentences. Connectors are limited to 'So', which is appropriate for A2. The simplification of complex phrases such as 'flipping between channels' to 'watched TV', 'US invasion of Iraq' to 'US was in a war in Iraq', 'competing to win a million dollars' to 'wanted to win money', and 'merge together in a disturbing way' to 'started to mix. It felt strange to her' demonstrates effective A2-level simplification without losing core meaning.",
