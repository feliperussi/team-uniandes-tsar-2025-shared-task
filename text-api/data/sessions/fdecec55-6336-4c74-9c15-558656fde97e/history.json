However, a deep qualitative audit reveals a critical vocabulary error.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Usage: The text uses the word 'forever', which is classified as B1 level. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 standard. The sentence 'She likes that her street art does not stay forever' contains this non-compliant word.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'forever' with an A2-compliant phrase. Use 'for a long time' or 'always'.",

This confirms the core message and key lexical items have been preserved with high fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance: The text is correctly classified as A2. A manual audit confirms this classification is accurate.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Complex concepts from the original, such as 'temporary' and 'cycle of endings and new beginnings', have been expertly rephrased into simple, declarative sentences appropriate for the target level. Sentence structure is consistently simple and clear.",
