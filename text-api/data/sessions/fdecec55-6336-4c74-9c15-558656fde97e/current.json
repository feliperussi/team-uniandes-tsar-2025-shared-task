This confirms the core message and key lexical items have been preserved with high fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Compliance: The text is correctly classified as A2. A manual audit confirms this classification is accurate.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Complex concepts from the original, such as 'temporary' and 'cycle of endings and new beginnings', have been expertly rephrased into simple, declarative sentences appropriate for the target level. Sentence structure is consistently simple and clear.",
