    "text_translated": "In the last ten years, people have criticized many big supermarkets for doing bad things. They have wasted a lot of food and paid their suppliers too little money. They also created too much plastic waste with their packaging, which has damaged our environment. However, supermarkets are now starting to pay attention because customers are very unhappy about the large amount of plastic waste. As a result, some of the biggest UK supermarkets have made an agreement. They promise to change their packaging and use less plastic.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. \n\nStructure and Flow: You have created a well-structured and coherent paragraph. Your use of connectors is a key strength, for example, using 'which' to add information ('...packaging, which has damaged our environment') and 'because' to explain a reason ('...pay attention because customers are very unhappy'). The use of transition words like 'However' and 'As a result' effectively links the ideas between sentences, creating a logical flow. \n\nVocabulary and Paraphrasing: Your vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level. You have skillfully paraphrased complex ideas from the original text into simpler, clearer language. For instance, changing 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' to 'criticized... for doing bad things' and 'consumer backlash' to 'customers are very unhappy' shows a strong ability to communicate meaning effectively without using advanced words. \n\nFactual Accuracy: The summary is factually accurate and includes all the key information from the original text without adding any personal opinions.",
