A CEFR B1 assessment requires evaluating a piece of connected text to judge structure, flow, vocabulary in context, and factual accuracy. Without the text, it is impossible to determine if the writer can meet the B1 'Can-Do' statements, such as writing simple, connected text on familiar topics. The provided vocabulary list alone is insufficient for a valid assessment."

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. \n\nStructure and Flow: You have created a well-structured and coherent paragraph. Your use of connectors is a key strength, for example, using 'which' to add information ('...packaging, which has damaged our environment') and 'because' to explain a reason ('...pay attention because customers are very unhappy'). The use of transition words like 'However' and 'As a result' effectively links the ideas between sentences, creating a logical flow. \n\nVocabulary and Paraphrasing: Your vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level. You have skillfully paraphrased complex ideas from the original text into simpler, clearer language. For instance, changing 'come under fire with accusations of various unethical acts' to 'criticized... for doing bad things' and 'consumer backlash' to 'customers are very unhappy' shows a strong ability to communicate meaning effectively without using advanced words. \n\nFactual Accuracy: The summary is factually accurate and includes all the key information from the original text without adding any personal opinions."
