    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about how genes work with our brain and language. Did a gene change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be about speaking. It is also about how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a gene like this one, but their gene did not change. It is too early to say how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA. DNA is the thing in our bodies that has all our genes.",
