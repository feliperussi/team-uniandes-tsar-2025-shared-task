Did a gene change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems connected to speaking. It is also connected to how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but their gene did not change. It is too early to say how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA. DNA is the material in our bodies that has all our genes.",

The goal is to use vocabulary the learner already knows, not to introduce new B1 terms. While the sentence structure is appropriately simple, the vocabulary is unacceptable. The definition of DNA, while helpful, introduces another complex term and uses the B1 word 'material'."

Higher-level words from the original text, such as 'mutation' and 'influence', have been expertly replaced with A2 equivalents ('change', 'important'). Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and perfectly suited for the A2 level. Factual accuracy is fully maintained. No corrections are necessary."
