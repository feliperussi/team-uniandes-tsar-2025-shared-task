    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.91) and BERTScore (0.93) are both excellent, confirming high fidelity to the original message. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The vocabulary strategy is particularly strong. Replacing the difficult concept of 'prophecy' with the clear phrase 'prediction of the future' is a perfect B1 simplification. Similarly, changing 'coincidence' to 'happen by chance' makes the meaning immediately accessible. The use of the B1 verb 'tend' is also a skillful choice. The final text is fluent, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the target level.",
