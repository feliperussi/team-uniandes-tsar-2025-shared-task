    "text_translated": "For the last ten years, people were angry with many big supermarkets. People said they did bad things. They threw away a lot of food. They did not pay enough money to the people who gave them the food. They also used too much plastic for their packaging. Packaging is the material, like plastic, that covers food in a shop. This was bad for our environment. But now, supermarkets are starting to listen. People are very angry about all the plastic rubbish. So, some big supermarkets in the UK made a promise. They are going to change their packaging and use less plastic.",
