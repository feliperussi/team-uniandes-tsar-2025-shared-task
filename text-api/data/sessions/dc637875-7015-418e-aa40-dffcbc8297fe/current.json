    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed. The text maintains factual integrity and meaning, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.8379 and BERTScore of 0.9376, both well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms excellent adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary has been simplified appropriately (e.g., 'pest' to 'problem', 'world's press' to 'news'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, with complex sentences from the original text effectively broken down into multiple, easy-to-understand A2-level sentences. Connectors used ('and', 'but', 'or') are all A2 appropriate. This is a model A2 simplification.",
