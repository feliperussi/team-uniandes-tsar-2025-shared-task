Vocabulary is strictly controlled, using almost exclusively A1 words with one appropriate A2 word ('public'). Sentence structures are short, simple, and direct, avoiding any B1-level complexity. The definitions provided for 'graffiti' and 'street art' are clear and use basic A2 language. The submission is flawless.",
