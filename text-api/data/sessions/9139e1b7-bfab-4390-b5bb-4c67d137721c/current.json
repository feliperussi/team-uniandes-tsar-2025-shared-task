    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: All key facts, names, locations, and actions from the original text have been accurately preserved. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.94 and BERTScore of 0.95 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key vocabulary were maintained. CEFR Compliance: The output correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategy was effective, particularly in splitting the final complex sentence into two shorter, more direct sentences. This improves readability significantly. For future improvement, consider identifying complex nouns like 'adventurer' or 'expeditions' as keywords that might require a definition for a B1 learner.",
