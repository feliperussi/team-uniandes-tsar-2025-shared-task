While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning very well, it has been oversimplified. The simplification of vocabulary such as 'expeditions' to 'trips' and the use of very direct sentence structures likely contributed to the lower CEFR rating. To elevate this text to B1, consider combining the two sentences to create a more complex structure that demonstrates a clearer relationship between his personal achievements and his community work, without losing clarity.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the sentence structure. The output combines four simpler original sentences into one very long and grammatically complex sentence: 'Erik Weihenmayer, an American adventurer who has been blind since he was 13, has ridden a bike across Morocco\u2019s deserts, kayaked in the Grand Canyon and climbed Mount Everest; besides his travels, he encourages people with disabilities to lead active lives and leads groups of young blind people on climbing expeditions.' The use of a non-defining relative clause ('who has been blind...') and a semicolon to link major ideas are grammatical features more typical of a B2 level. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, break this sentence into two or three shorter sentences, using simpler connectors. This will improve readability and align with the target CEFR level.",

Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.94 and BERTScore of 0.95 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key vocabulary were maintained. CEFR Compliance: The output correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategy was effective, particularly in splitting the final complex sentence into two shorter, more direct sentences. This improves readability significantly. For future improvement, consider identifying complex nouns like 'adventurer' or 'expeditions' as keywords that might require a definition for a B1 learner.",
