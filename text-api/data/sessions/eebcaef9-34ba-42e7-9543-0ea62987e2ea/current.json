    "text_translated": "Over the last ten years, people have said that big supermarkets do bad things. For example, they have wasted a lot of food. They also paid the companies that provide their products too little money. They have also created too much plastic waste with their packaging. This has had a bad effect on our environment. But now, supermarkets are starting to pay attention. Customers are very angry about the huge amount of plastic waste from packaging. Because of this, some of the biggest UK supermarkets have made a promise. They promised to change their packaging and reduce plastic waste.",
