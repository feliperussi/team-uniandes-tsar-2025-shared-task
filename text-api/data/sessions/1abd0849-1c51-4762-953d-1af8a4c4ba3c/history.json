This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text presents a nuanced argument about balancing cultural awareness against the dangers of stereotyping.

The score of 0.5295 confirms this significant meaning shift.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8639 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to the replacement of specific, important phrases like 'miscommunication', 'detrimental to building good business relationships', and 'pigeonhole' with overly generic A2 language. This has resulted in a loss of lexical fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1-level word 'stereotype' is used in the text. The A2 standard requires replacing complex vocabulary, not merely defining it and then using it. The word itself must be removed and its meaning conveyed using only A2-level words.\n\n- Corrective Action: You must rewrite the text to restore the original's argument. Do not simply list facts. Show the relationship between knowing about culture and the mistake of thinking everyone is the same. Remove the word 'stereotype' entirely and use its simple definition in its place throughout the text.",

Your output reduces this to a generic message about not using 'simple ideas'. The central argument is lost.\n\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8693 is below the required 0.90. This reflects the loss of key concepts from the original text. Words like 'awareness', 'expectations', 'miscommunication', and 'detrimental' were removed, and their meaning was not adequately replaced with A2-level equivalents.\n\n- Example of Meaning Loss: The original specifies a wide range of influences beyond national culture, including 'the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences'. Your version reduces this to 'their age and their family... The company they work for... the things that happen in their life', which is a significant loss of detail and meaning.\n\n- Suggestion: The task is not merely to write a simple text on the topic of culture. The task is to rewrite the original text at an A2 level. You must restore the original's core argument about the correct and incorrect ways to use cultural knowledge in professional relationships.

The BERTScore of 0.8539 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's central theme is the nuanced danger of misusing cultural knowledge in a professional context, specifically how stereotypes are 'detrimental to building good business relationships'. Your output reduces this to a generic and simplistic warning ('Stereotypes are very bad when we work with people'), completely losing the specific context of 'building relationships' and the sophisticated concept of knowledge being 'detrimental'.\n\n- Lexical Failure: Key B1/B2 concepts from the original like 'miscommunication', 'business relationships', 'corporate culture', and 'pigeonhole' have been completely erased. This oversimplification is the direct cause of the low BERTScore.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'stereotype' is a C1-level term. Including it in an A2 text is an immediate failure, regardless of whether a definition is provided. The task is to explain the concept using A2 vocabulary, not to define a C1 word.\n\n- Structural Simplification: The text uses excessively short, repetitive sentences ('It can change... It can change...'). This A1-level structure further contributes to the loss of meaning by breaking down connected ideas into isolated, simplistic statements.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to restore the original meaning. Focus on the idea that wrong ideas about groups of people can break professional relationships. Do not use the word 'stereotype'; describe the action of thinking all people from a country are the same. Combine the short, repetitive sentences to show how different factors (age, job, home area) are all important parts of one person.",

This loss of nuance is a critical failure.\n- BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items from the original were completely removed, not simplified. Terms like 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', 'corporate culture', and 'pigeonhole' carry significant weight. Their removal resulted in a text that does not faithfully represent the original's vocabulary.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is incorrectly classified as B1, not A2. This is due to unacceptable grammatical complexity. The sentence 'If they are a man or a woman is also important' uses a subordinate clause as the subject, which is a B1 structure.\n- Corrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. The text must communicate the idea of holding knowledge in reserve, not just having it. Rephrase the final paragraph to reflect this.\n- Suggestion: Fix the B1 grammar. Rephrase the complex sentence. Use 'It is also important if a person is a man or a woman.' This is a simpler A2 structure.\n- Suggestion: The simplification was too aggressive, leading to meaning loss.
