Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

        "feedback_text": "The text violates the strict A2 vocabulary rule. The word 'affect' is B1 level. The word 'similar' is B1 level. The term 'DNA' is B2 and was not defined, making it incomprehensible to an A2 learner. While 'gene' was correctly defined as per the instructions, this does not excuse the other vocabulary failures. The text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary."

        "feedback_text": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It correctly identifies and defines the key B2 term 'gene' using A1 vocabulary. All sentences are simple, declarative, and grammatically correct for the A2 level. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range, with excellent substitutions like 'scientists' for 'researchers' and 'change' for 'mutation'. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary."
