    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body. It tells your body how to grow and work. We have more questions about genes. We want to know what they do to our brain and language. Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a gene that is almost the same. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. DNA is the information inside every part of your body. One day we might find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It correctly identifies and defines the key B2 term 'gene' using A1 vocabulary. All sentences are simple, declarative, and grammatically correct for the A2 level. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range, with excellent substitutions like 'scientists' for 'researchers' and 'change' for 'mutation'. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary.",
