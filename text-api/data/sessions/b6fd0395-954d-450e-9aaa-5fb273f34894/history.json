        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates the strict A2 vocabulary rule. The word 'protect' is B1 level. Replacing the B1 word 'defence' with another B1 word is an unacceptable error. The goal is exclusive use of A2 vocabulary, not substitution with vocabulary of the same complexity. The rest of the text shows a good attempt at simplification, but this single violation results in failure."

All complex vocabulary from the original text ('potentially', 'orbit', 'threat', 'predictions', 'impact', 'defence solutions') has been expertly replaced with simple A1/A2 equivalents ('can be', 'fly very close', 'danger', 'say if', 'hit', 'plans to keep us safe'). Sentence structures are simple, declarative, and immediately understandable. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are necessary."
