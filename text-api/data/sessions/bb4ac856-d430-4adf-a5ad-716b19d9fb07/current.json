    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification and meets all protocol requirements without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is 100% factually consistent with the original text.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.8161 and BERTScore at 0.9244 confirm excellent meaning and fidelity preservation. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'focus' and 'themselves' are used appropriately for the target level.\n- Structural Simplification: Sentence structure is consistently simple and short. The use of connectors is limited to 'and', 'but', and 'so', which is ideal for A2. Complex concepts from the original, such as 'distractions' and 'co-working space', were correctly rephrased into simple A2 terms ('Many things stopped me from working', 'a special office').\n- Keyword Definition: The keyword 'freelancer' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms at the beginning of the text. This is a model execution.",
