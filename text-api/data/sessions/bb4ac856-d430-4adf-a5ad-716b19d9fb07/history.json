No information has been lost or altered.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8161 and BERTScore of 0.9244 are well above the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of meaning and lexical detail.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct. The text is a model of A2-level writing.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates exemplary adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is appropriately restricted. The key term 'freelancer' is defined immediately using simple A2 language. Sentence structures are short, clear, and use only basic connectors ('and', 'but', 'so'). The simplification of concepts like 'distractions' and 'office environment' is executed perfectly.",

MeaningBERT at 0.8161 and BERTScore at 0.9244 confirm excellent meaning and fidelity preservation. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'focus' and 'themselves' are used appropriately for the target level.\n- Structural Simplification: Sentence structure is consistently simple and short. The use of connectors is limited to 'and', 'but', and 'so', which is ideal for A2. Complex concepts from the original, such as 'distractions' and 'co-working space', were correctly rephrased into simple A2 terms ('Many things stopped me from working', 'a special office').\n- Keyword Definition: The keyword 'freelancer' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms at the beginning of the text. This is a model execution.",
