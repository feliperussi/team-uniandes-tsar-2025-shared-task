    "text_translated": "Graffiti is writing or pictures painted on walls and buildings, and people often ask if it is art or vandalism. Vandalism is the crime of breaking property that doesn't belong to you. The answer depends on your opinion, but in many countries, it is considered vandalism when people write or paint on public or private property. Because of this, many street artists have been caught by the police, and some have had to pay money as a punishment. In addition, city governments often complain about how much it costs to clean the graffiti from buildings, buses and trains.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.8572) and BERTScore (0.931) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key details. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The submission's key strength lies in its vocabulary strategy: it successfully defines the keywords 'graffiti' and 'vandalism' at the beginning, which is an excellent technique for a B1 audience. Furthermore, the use of B1 connectors like 'Because of this' and 'In addition' improves the text's flow and cohesion. This is a model example of a successful B1 simplification.",
