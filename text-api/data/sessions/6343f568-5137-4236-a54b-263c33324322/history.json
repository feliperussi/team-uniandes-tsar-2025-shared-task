The BERTScore of 0.8596 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key lexical information. The text oversimplifies critical concepts, losing the specific meaning and fidelity of the original. \n\nDeviations:\n- Meaning Preservation: The original text discusses employees 'perceiving positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value'. Your version simplifies this to 'they think the good feedback is not real. They think it is just to make the bad feedback easier. So, the good feedback is not helpful.' This loses the specific concept of 'sugarcoating' and the 'diminishing value' of the positive feedback itself, replacing it with a more general 'not real' or 'not helpful' sentiment.\n- Fidelity: Key phrases from the original, such as 'sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments' and 'reinforce and encourage good performance', are not adequately preserved. While the general idea is present, the specific wording and lexical detail are lost, contributing to the low BERTScore. For example, 'reinforce and encourage good performance' is reduced to 'help people do better work. It should make them want to do well', which is a less precise and less direct translation of the original intent.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to more accurately convey the specific meaning of 'sugarcoating' and 'diminishing value' without increasing complexity.

'Diminishing its value' is simplified to 'It loses its power to help.', which is a weaker and less accurate representation of 'value'. 'Reinforce and encourage good performance' is broken into 'make good work stronger.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6925 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8904 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant deviation from the original's key words and phrasing. Specific deviations include: The original concept of 'employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives' is simplified to 'They think good comments just make bad things seem good', which loses the specific nuance of 'sugarcoating' and the psychological aspect of 'perceive'. The phrase 'thus diminishing its value' is simplified to 'It loses its worth', which is less precise. Key lexical items such as 'inject some positivity', 'rely on sandwiching', 'cushion the negative', and 'reinforce and encourage good performance' were replaced with less specific or lexically dissimilar phrases like 'want to make their feedback positive', 'use a special way. They put bad feedback between two good comments', 'hide bad things', and 'make good work stronger and help people do it more'. These changes, while simplifying, resulted in an unacceptable loss of lexical and semantic fidelity as measured by the metrics. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain more of the original's specific meaning and key vocabulary, even when simplifying for A2. For example, 'sugarcoating the negatives' could be 'making bad things seem better' to retain more meaning. 'Diminishing its value' could be 'it becomes less useful'. Ensure that the core concepts are not just simplified, but accurately represented with A2 vocabulary.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and its nuances. The BERTScore of 0.8836 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key lexical items from the original text. \n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The central concept of 'feedback' (a keyword for definition) has been entirely replaced with 'comments about work'. While 'comments about work' is simpler, it dilutes the original's focus on a structured process of evaluation and guidance, shifting the meaning from a strategic discussion of 'feedback' to more general 'comments'. This is a major contributor to the low MeaningBERT score.\n- The phrase 'diminishing its value' from the original is simplified to 'It becomes less useful'. While understandable, the original conveys a stronger sense of loss of inherent worth, which is slightly softened in the simplified version.\n- The nuanced phrase 'reinforce and encourage good performance' isified to 'make good work stronger. It should help people do good work more.' This simplification loses some of the specific intent of 'reinforce' and 'encourage' in a professional context.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce the concept of 'feedback' using simple A2-level definitions. For example, 'Feedback is when managers tell people about their work.' Ensure that the core terms from the original, even if simplified, retain their specific meaning and context. Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the strategic implications of feedback, rather than just general comments.",
