    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. No discrepancies were found.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are within the required parameters. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7752 and BERTScore of 0.924 confirm high preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR Classifier correctly identified the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The use of 'horror' and 'empty' is appropriate for the target level. No words above A2 were detected.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's clauses have been successfully deconstructed into short, simple sentences. The use of fragments ('For example, an old hospital.') is an effective and acceptable simplification strategy for this level. The text is a model example of A2 compliance.",
