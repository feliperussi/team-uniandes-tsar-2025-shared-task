    "feedback": "The output is factually accurate and retains all key details from the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.879 and BERTScore of 0.9584 confirm strong meaning preservation, and the text is correctly classified at B1 level. The sequence of events is clear and the vocabulary choices are appropriate for B1. To improve flow, consider varying your connectors: for example, use \u201cwhile\u201d instead of \u201cduring\u201d in the first sentence (\u201cOne night in 2003, while the US was invading Iraq, Suzanne Collins\u2026\u201d) or start the third sentence with \u201cBecause\u201d to show cause and effect (\u201cBecause she could only find those programmes\u2026\u201d). The parenthetical note \u201c(the title of her book)\u201d is accurate but could be integrated smoothly: \u201cThen she had the idea for The Hunger Games, which became the title of her book.\u201d These changes will make the narrative even more engaging and cohesive for B1 learners.",
