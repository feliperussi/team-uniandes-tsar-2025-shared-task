For example, the sentence \u201cShe says these two kinds of programmes started to mix in her mind in a worrying way, and the idea for The Hunger Games, which is a story about a cruel TV competition where teenagers have to fight to survive, came to her.\u201d contains a long non-restrictive relative clause and multiple subordinate structures that exceed B1 complexity. To meet B1 requirements, split this into shorter sentences and simplify clauses. For instance, you could write: \u201cShe says the two types of programmes began to mix in her mind in a worrying way.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.879 and BERTScore of 0.9584 confirm strong meaning preservation, and the text is correctly classified at B1 level. The sequence of events is clear and the vocabulary choices are appropriate for B1. To improve flow, consider varying your connectors: for example, use \u201cwhile\u201d instead of \u201cduring\u201d in the first sentence (\u201cOne night in 2003, while the US was invading Iraq, Suzanne Collins\u2026\u201d) or start the third sentence with \u201cBecause\u201d to show cause and effect (\u201cBecause she could only find those programmes\u2026\u201d). The parenthetical note \u201c(the title of her book)\u201d is accurate but could be integrated smoothly: \u201cThen she had the idea for The Hunger Games, which became the title of her book.\u201d These changes will make the narrative even more engaging and cohesive for B1 learners.",
