    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8875 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n*   Primary Deviation: The simplification process removed too much of the original's specific vocabulary, causing the fidelity score to drop. Key concepts like 'waste time commuting', 'flexibility', and 'downside' were replaced with phrases that are too distant from the source material.\n*   Factual Omission: The original text specifies a 'global IT company'. Your output reduces this to 'a company', which is a loss of a key fact.\n*   Structural Simplification: The text has been broken down into a list of short, disconnected sentences. This is an overly simplistic structure that fails to connect ideas as the original did.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to re-introduce key vocabulary from the original in an A2-compliant manner. Restore the 'IT company' detail. Combine some sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'but' to better reflect the relationships between ideas in the original text.",
