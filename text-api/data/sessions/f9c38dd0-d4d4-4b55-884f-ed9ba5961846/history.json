This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and concepts from the original text due to oversimplification.\n\n- Lexical Loss: Key concepts like 'flexibility' and 'valuable' were completely removed. The original text explains WHY the work style is good; your version only states the consequence ('I can easily take time off'). This is a critical loss of meaning.\n\n- Nuance Loss: The phrase 'waste time commuting' was replaced with 'do not travel to work'. This loses the negative meaning of 'waste time', which is an important part of the original message.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The original text uses connectors like 'because' to show relationships between ideas. Your version breaks every clause into a separate, simple sentence. This makes the text choppy and removes the logical flow. The text is a list of facts, not a coherent paragraph.\n\n- Suggestion: Reintroduce the core concepts. You must explain that the work is 'flexible' and this is 'good' or 'valuable'.\n\n- Suggestion: Use simple A2 connectors like 'so' and 'because' to link related ideas. Do not break every single clause into a new sentence.\n\n- Suggestion: Revise phrases to retain their original nuance. 'I do not waste time travelling to work' is a more faithful A2 simplification than 'I do not travel to work'.",

This is the primary reason for failure.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The score is low because key lexical details from the original text were lost. The phrase \"global IT company\" was simplified to \"company that works in many countries,\" which omits the critical \"IT\" detail. The concept of \"flexibility is very valuable\" was replaced with the less precise \"This means a lot to me.\" These changes reduce the text's fidelity to the source.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word \"means\" is used twice. In the context of \"This means I can change my work time,\" it functions as a B1/B2 level vocabulary item. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n- Suggestion: Restore the \"IT\" detail by stating it is a \"computer company\" or \"IT company\". Rephrase the sentences using \"means\". Replace \"This means I can change my work time easily\" with \"So, I can change my work time easily.\" Replace \"This means a lot to me\" with \"This is very good for me.\" These changes will improve fidelity and adhere to the A2 vocabulary.",

While simplification is necessary for A2, it must not come at the cost of lexical fidelity.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low. Key terms from the original text such as 'commuting', 'colleagues', 'flexibility', and 'valuable' were replaced with overly generic phrases. This caused the fidelity score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'global' was used in the first sentence. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the text to increase lexical precision while maintaining simplicity. Restore some of the original's key terms in a simplified context or find closer A2-level synonyms. Remove the word 'global' and replace it with an A2 phrase, for example, 'a company that is in many countries'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1 word 'flexibility' was used twice. This is a severe violation of the A2 standard. Advanced vocabulary must be rephrased using simple A2 terms, not included directly.\n- Lexical Loss: The oversimplification caused a loss of important concepts. The original's 'valuable' was replaced with the generic 'good'. The concept of a 'downside' was removed entirely, altering the balanced perspective of the original text. This contributed to the low BERTScore.\n- Structural Oversimplification: The text is broken into excessively short, choppy sentences. While A2 requires simplicity, this level of fragmentation is more characteristic of A1 and damages the natural flow of the text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to remove the word 'flexibility'. Use a simple A2 sentence to explain the concept, such as 'I can change my work hours when I need to.' Combine some of the very short sentences to improve readability while maintaining A2 structure. For example: 'I work online from home, so I do not travel to work.'",
