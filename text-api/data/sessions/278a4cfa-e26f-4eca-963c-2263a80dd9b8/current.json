    "feedback": "PASS: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to the CEFR A2 readability standard. All diagnostic checks were successfully passed. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original text and the writer's output. Meaning preservation is strong, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8579, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original's lexical content is also high, with a BERTScore of 0.9289, exceeding the 0.90 requirement. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms strict A2 compliance. Vocabulary is consistently at the A1/A2 level, with no B1 or higher words detected. Sentence structures are short, simple, and direct, using appropriate A1/A2 connectors such as 'So', 'and', and 'But'. The definition provided for 'lifeboat' is clear and uses only A1/A2 vocabulary, effectively supporting comprehension. This is a well-executed simplification.",
