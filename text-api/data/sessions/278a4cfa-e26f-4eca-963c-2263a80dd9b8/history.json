The MeaningBERT score of 0.6319 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a failure to preserve the core message and narrative coherence of the original text. While the BERTScore for lexical fidelity is acceptable, the overall meaning has been diluted. Specific deviations include: The original text's causal links, such as 'new government is elected that his parents don't support. Worried about the future, Pi's parents decide...', are broken into overly simplistic, disconnected sentences like 'New leaders come to his country. Pi's parents do not like these leaders. They are worried about the future. So, Pi's parents close their zoo.' This fragmentation loses the nuanced cause-and-effect relationship. The dramatic contrast and emotional impact conveyed by 'Tragically... but Pi finds himself...' is lost. The writer's output uses 'Pi's family and the ship's sailors die in the water. This is very sad.' and then immediately inserts a definition: 'A lifeboat is a small boat. It helps people when a ship sinks.' This insertion of explanatory text, while potentially for A2, disrupts the narrative flow and was not present in the original, further contributing to the meaning degradation. The definition of 'lifeboat' should be integrated more subtly or assumed if the context is clear enough for A2. The original's 'enormous tiger' is simplified to 'very big tiger', which is acceptable for A2, but the overall impact is diminished by the other issues.",

While individual facts are present, the core meaning and causal relationships from the original text are weakened. The original text clearly links the political situation ('new government is elected that his parents don't support') to the decision to leave ('Worried about the future, Pi's parents decide to close the zoo and emigrate to Canada'). Your version fragments this into multiple short sentences ('New leaders come to his country. Pi's parents do not like these leaders. They are worried about the future. So, Pi's parents close their zoo. They decide to move to Canada.'), which dilutes the strong causal connection and the specific nuance of 'emigrate' (a permanent, often politically motivated departure) compared to 'move'. This fragmentation reduces the overall semantic coherence and impact of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase to maintain stronger causal links between events, even with simple A2 connectors. Ensure the full implication of 'emigrate' is conveyed.",

The extreme fragmentation of sentences and the removal of crucial connecting words have diluted the core narrative and the relationships between events, failing to preserve the original's meaning. Specific deviations include: The original text uses 'but' to highlight the tragic contrast between the family's death and Pi's survival with animals. Your version removes this crucial contrast, stating facts without the original's narrative tension. The original implies a direct cause-and-effect for the emigration ('Worried about the future, Pi's parents decide...'). Your version breaks this into separate, less connected statements, weakening the causal link. The original mentions 'a new government is elected that his parents don't support', conveying a specific political context. Your version simplifies this to 'New leaders come to his country. Pi's parents do not like these leaders', losing the nuance of 'elected government'. The word 'tragically' in the original, while B1, conveys a strong emotional tone that is completely absent in your factual recounting of deaths. Suggestion: Reintroduce the 'but' conjunction to preserve the contrast between the family's death and Pi's survival. A2 allows 'but'. Suggestion: Combine sentences using A2 connectors like 'so' or 'because' to better link causes and effects, for example, 'Pi's parents do not like these leaders, so they are worried about the future.' Suggestion: While simplifying vocabulary, ensure the core relationships and narrative flow are maintained. Do not sacrifice meaning for extreme brevity.",

This indicates a failure to fully preserve the core message and emotional tone of the original text. The text passed the BERTScore (0.9208) and CEFR classification (A2), but the meaning has been diluted. \n- The original text uses the word 'tragically' to convey the severe emotional impact of the family's death. Your version omits this, thereby losing a critical aspect of the original's meaning and tone. \n- The original describes the tiger as 'enormous'. Your version uses 'very big', which diminishes the intensity and scale implied by 'enormous'. \n- The original specifies that animals were sold to zoos in 'North America'. This detail is absent in your version, contributing to a loss of fidelity. \n- While sentence simplification is necessary for A2, the fragmentation of the narrative in your version, despite using connectors like 'So' and 'Because of this', dilutes the direct cause-and-effect and the overall impact of the parents' decision to emigrate due to their strong disapproval of the new government. \nSuggestion: Restore the emotional weight by including words like 'tragically' or an A2 equivalent. Use precise A2-level adjectives that maintain the original's intensity, such as finding an A2 equivalent for 'enormous' or rephrasing to convey the same scale. Ensure all key factual details, even minor ones like 'North America' if possible within A2 constraints, are retained.
