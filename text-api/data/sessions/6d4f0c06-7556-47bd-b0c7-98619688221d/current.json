    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 criteria without deviation.\n\n- Factual Accuracy: The core reasons for bridge collapse (low-quality material, part problems, weight limits) are correctly and fully preserved from the original text.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as A2. The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels, as confirmed by the vocabulary analysis. All words are appropriate for the target level.\n- Structural Simplicity: The use of short, simple sentences is exemplary. Complex ideas from the original are effectively broken down into separate, easy-to-understand statements. The structure is a model of A2 clarity.\n- Metric Adherence: Both MeaningBERT (0.77) and BERTScore (0.91) are well within the required ranges, confirming that core meaning and key terms were retained with high fidelity.",
