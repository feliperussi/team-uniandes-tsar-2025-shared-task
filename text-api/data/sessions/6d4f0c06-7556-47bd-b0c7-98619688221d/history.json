They have to study it carefully.'), which weakens this crucial cause-and-effect relationship.

It must be removed and explained using A2 vocabulary.\n- Vocabulary Compliance Failure: The word 'used' is B1 level. It must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning. Combine sentences to show that studying the bridge is how engineers find the reason. Remove the B1 word 'mystery' entirely.
