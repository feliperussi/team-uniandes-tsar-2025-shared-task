    "text_translated": "It is good to know that people can be different. This helps us talk to people without problems. But we must remember something very important. Stereotypes can be bad for our work with other people. Stereotypes are simple ideas about a group of people, and these ideas are often not true. The culture of a country can change how we act and think. But many other things are also important. The area we come from, the people we know, our age, and if we are a man or a woman are all important. The culture of our company and the things that happen in our life also change us. So, we should remember these possible differences. But we should not use this information to think all people from a country are the same.",
