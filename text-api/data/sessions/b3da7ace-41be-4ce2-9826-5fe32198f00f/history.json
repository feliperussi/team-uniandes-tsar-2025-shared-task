Cultural stereotypes can be bad for our work with other people. Stereotypes are simple ideas about a group of people, and these ideas are often not true. The culture of a country can change how we act and think. But many other things are also important. The area we come from, the people we know, our age, and if we are a man or a woman are all important. The culture of our company and our life experiences also change us. So, we should remember these possible differences. But we should not use this information to think all people from a country are the same.",

The rules demand exclusive use of A2 vocabulary. While many concepts were simplified well, the inclusion of B1 vocabulary results in an immediate failure. The text is not A2 compliant."
