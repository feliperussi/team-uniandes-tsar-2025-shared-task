    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6173 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core message and nuances of the original text have been lost or diluted through oversimplification and fragmentation. Specific issues include: The original text states 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology'. Your version separates this into 'Suzanne Collins loves old Greek stories. These stories are called Greek myths. They gave her an important idea for her book, 'The Hunger Games'.' This fragmentation weakens the direct causal link between her love of mythology and the inspiration for the book. The original's 'The youths are thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster' is split into 'Minos threw these young people into a labyrinth. A monster called the Minotaur lived there. It ate the young people.' This breaks the direct connection between the act of throwing them into the labyrinth and their intended fate, losing the nuance of the punishment. The phrase 'Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus' is a direct comparison of roles. Your version 'Suzanne thinks Katniss Everdeen is like Theseus in the future' is a weaker, more general similarity, losing the specific parallel. Additionally, the text contains B1 vocabulary that is not appropriate for an A2 level. The word 'punish' is a B1 word. The word 'Hunger' in 'The Hunger Games' is also a B1 word. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to clearly state that Suzanne's love of Greek mythology was the direct inspiration for 'The Hunger Games'. Suggestion: Combine sentences to clearly link the youths being thrown into the labyrinth with their fate of being eaten by the Minotaur as a punishment. Suggestion: Strengthen the comparison between Katniss and Theseus to reflect a direct role, such as 'Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a new Theseus for the future'. Suggestion: Replace B1 words like 'punish' and 'Hunger' with simpler A2 alternatives or rephrase sentences to avoid them.",
