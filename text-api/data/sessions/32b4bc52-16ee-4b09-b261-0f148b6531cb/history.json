This indicates a critical loss of core meaning from the original text. The simplified version fails to convey key narrative elements and the severity of the situation.\n\nSpecific Deviations:\n- The crucial concept of 'punishment' for the Athenians' rebellion is entirely omitted. The original states, 'As a punishment, Minos the king of Crete forces the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls'. Your version only states, 'This was a bad thing for them', which is a severe weakening and loss of the original's intent.\n- The active and forceful verb 'forces' (Minos forces the Athenians) is weakened to 'made' (He made Athens send). This reduces the sense of compulsion and the king's power.\n- The phrase 'thrown into the labyrinth' is weakened to 'went into a labyrinth'. This loses the violent and involuntary nature of the youths' entry into the monster's lair.\n- The definition of 'Minotaur' is added unnecessarily in the middle of the story's introduction. While simplifying, it disrupts the flow and is not a direct rephrasing of the original content at that point.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the concept of 'punishment' explicitly. Use stronger verbs to convey the forced nature of the tribute and the entry into the labyrinth. Ensure all critical plot points and their emotional weight are preserved, even in simpler language.",

The text describes the events of the myth but fails to convey the depth of its 'important inspiration' for 'The Hunger Games' as effectively as the original. Specific deviations include: The original's 'An important inspiration' is weakened to 'gave her an idea', losing the emphasis on the significance of the myth. The direct and impactful description of the youths' fate, 'thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster', is diluted into multiple, less connected sentences ('Minos sent these young people into a labyrinth. A Minotaur lived there. A Minotaur is a monster. It eats people. The Minotaur ate them.'), which diminishes the horror and direct consequence. The powerful comparison of Katniss as a 'futuristic Theseus' is softened to 'is like Theseus' with a separate, explanatory sentence 'Katniss lives in the future', which reduces the direct thematic link. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to emphasize the 'important inspiration'. Combine sentences to maintain the direct cause-and-effect of the youths' fate. Rephrase the Katniss comparison to be more direct and impactful, reflecting her role as a 'futuristic Theseus'.",

This indicates a loss of the core message's nuance and depth. The original text emphasizes 'Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology' as the 'inspiration', which is simplified to 'Suzanne Collins loves old Greek stories' and 'important idea'. This dilutes the specific emotional and literary connection. Additionally, 'forces the Athenians to send' is weakened to 'made Athens send', losing the stronger sense of coercion. The original's concise description of the youths being 'thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster' is broken into multiple sentences, which, while simpler, loses some of the direct impact and semantic connection.\n\nFurther deviations from A2 standard:\nVocabulary: The word 'punish' is classified as B1, but it is used in the sentence 'This was to punish Athens.' This word is above the A2 level.\nVocabulary: The word 'Hunger' in 'The Hunger Games' is classified as B1. While part of a proper noun, its presence indicates a B1 vocabulary item.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to capture the full semantic weight of the original text while maintaining A2 simplicity. For instance, find an A2 equivalent for 'punish' or rephrase the sentence to avoid it. Ensure that the emotional and specific nature of 'classical Greek mythology' and 'inspiration' is conveyed more accurately at an A2 level.",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuances, despite factual accuracy. The simplification has altered the semantic relationships between ideas too much. The original text states 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology.' Your version 'Suzanne Collins loves old Greek stories. These stories helped her write 'The Hunger Games'.' loses the specific nuance of 'important inspiration' and 'classical Greek mythology' by oversimplifying to 'old Greek stories' and 'helped her write'. The original phrase 'As a punishment, Minos the king of Crete forces the Athenians to send...' is a direct cause-and-effect. Your version 'Minos punished Athens for fighting back. He made Athens send...' separates these ideas, weakening the direct link and contributing to the meaning loss. The original 'Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus' presents a single, integrated concept. Your version 'Suzanne thinks Katniss Everdeen is like Theseus. Katniss lives in the future.' separates the 'futuristic' aspect from 'Theseus', diluting the original meaning of a 'futuristic Theseus'. Additionally, the word 'fighting' (B1) is used in 'Athens fought back' and 'punished Athens for fighting back'. This is above the A2 standard. The word 'hunger' (B1) is also present in 'The Hunger Games'. While a proper noun, the word itself is B1 and should be considered for simplification if possible, or acknowledged as a deviation if the goal is strict A2 vocabulary for all words.",

Specifically, the original text states 'the Athenians rebel', implying active resistance, which your version simplifies to 'did not obey', losing the strength of their defiance. Furthermore, the original identifies Theseus as 'one of the youths' sent as punishment, but your text refers to him as 'one young man', which diminishes his specific role as one of the victims. These changes subtly alter the narrative's emphasis. Suggestion: Rephrase 'did not obey' to 'rebelled' or 'fought back'. Rephrase 'one young man' to 'one of these young people' to maintain Theseus's specific context.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5927 is significantly below the required 0.75. While the factual information is present, the core message and nuance of the original text have been lost through oversimplification and fragmentation. The text fails to convey the depth of the original's meaning.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score: The score of 0.5927 indicates a substantial loss of the original's semantic content. For example, the original's 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology' is reduced to 'Suzanne Collins loves old Greek stories. These stories gave her a big idea for her book.' This simplification loses the specific nature of 'classical Greek mythology' and the emphasis on 'important inspiration' as the source, replacing it with a more generic 'big idea'.\n- Semantic Nuance Loss: The original's 'the city of Athens is ruled by Crete' is rephrased as 'Crete ruled Athens'. While factually similar, this shifts the grammatical focus and subtly alters the meaning's emphasis. Similarly, 'forces the Athenians to send' is weakened to 'made Athens send', losing the stronger sense of coercion.\n- Fragmentation of Integrated Concepts: The original's 'The youths are thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster that lives there called the Minotaur' is broken into multiple, disconnected sentences: 'Minos threw these young people into a labyrinth. A monster lived there. Its name was the Minotaur. It ate the young people.' This fragmentation, while simplifying sentence structure, disrupts the integrated description and weakens the semantic connection of the actions, contributing to the low MeaningBERT score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to retain more of the original's specific terminology and the integrated flow of ideas, even while simplifying grammar. Ensure that key concepts like 'inspiration' and 'classical mythology' are conveyed with more fidelity. Avoid excessive fragmentation that breaks the semantic links between actions and descriptions.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6173 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core message and nuances of the original text have been lost or diluted through oversimplification and fragmentation. Specific issues include: The original text states 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology'. Your version separates this into 'Suzanne Collins loves old Greek stories. These stories are called Greek myths. They gave her an important idea for her book, 'The Hunger Games'.' This fragmentation weakens the direct causal link between her love of mythology and the inspiration for the book. The original's 'The youths are thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster' is split into 'Minos threw these young people into a labyrinth. A monster called the Minotaur lived there. It ate the young people.' This breaks the direct connection between the act of throwing them into the labyrinth and their intended fate, losing the nuance of the punishment. The phrase 'Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus' is a direct comparison of roles. Your version 'Suzanne thinks Katniss Everdeen is like Theseus in the future' is a weaker, more general similarity, losing the specific parallel. Additionally, the text contains B1 vocabulary that is not appropriate for an A2 level. The word 'punish' is a B1 word. The word 'Hunger' in 'The Hunger Games' is also a B1 word. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to clearly state that Suzanne's love of Greek mythology was the direct inspiration for 'The Hunger Games'. Suggestion: Combine sentences to clearly link the youths being thrown into the labyrinth with their fate of being eaten by the Minotaur as a punishment. Suggestion: Strengthen the comparison between Katniss and Theseus to reflect a direct role, such as 'Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a new Theseus for the future'. Suggestion: Replace B1 words like 'punish' and 'Hunger' with simpler A2 alternatives or rephrase sentences to avoid them.",
