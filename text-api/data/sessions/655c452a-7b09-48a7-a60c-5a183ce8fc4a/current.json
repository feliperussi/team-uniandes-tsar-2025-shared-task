    "text_translated": "An asteroid is a small space rock that travels around the Sun. NASA is now working to record some of the smaller ones. These asteroids measure 140 metres wide or more. Scientists estimate there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. So far, only about 8,000 have been recorded. That leaves around 17,000 not yet recorded. In 2013, a 19-metre asteroid exploded above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk and injured 1,200 people. This shows that even a small object can be dangerous. These middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier labeled the text as \u2018A2\u2019, which means it is too simple for a B1 level. Most sentences are short and independent, for example: \u201cSo far, only about 8,000 have been recorded. That leaves around 17,000 not yet recorded.\u201d Such simple structures keep the overall level in A2. To raise the level to B1, combine ideas with connectors (for example: \u201cSo far, only about 8,000 have been recorded, leaving around 17,000 unaccounted for.\u201d), use more varied sentence structures (such as relative clauses: \u201cAsteroids, which are small space rocks orbiting the Sun, can measure 140 metres or more.\u201d), and include B1-level linking words like however, therefore, and although. This will make the text more complex and fluent while preserving its accuracy.",
