While the text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, the simplification was too aggressive. Key vocabulary from the original, such as 'infrequent' and 'resistant', was replaced with much simpler A1/A2 level phrases like 'not very common' and 'stronger'. This resulted in a text that lacks the lexical complexity expected for a B1 learner. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, reintroduce slightly more advanced vocabulary. For example, 'it is not very common for them to fall down' could be revised to 'this kind of collapse does not happen often'.",

The primary reason for this is the retention of the B2-level vocabulary word 'collapse'. The vocabulary analysis identified 'collapse' as a B2 word that should be replaced, but it was kept in the final text. Additionally, the first sentence is structurally complex for a B1 reader, combining multiple clauses. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, replace 'collapse' with a simpler phrase like 'this kind of damage'. Also, consider splitting the first long sentence into two shorter sentences to improve readability.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is effective. Splitting the second sentence into two parts ('Luckily, this kind of damage does not happen often. This is especially true for modern bridges.') is a strong technique that improves readability for the target level. Vocabulary substitutions, such as replacing 'infrequent' with 'does not happen often' and 'design' with 'build', are well-executed. The change from 'collapse' to 'damage' is a reasonable simplification, though it loses a small degree of specificity. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets the B1 criteria.",
