    "feedback": "The submission passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is effective. Splitting the second sentence into two parts ('Luckily, this kind of damage does not happen often. This is especially true for modern bridges.') is a strong technique that improves readability for the target level. Vocabulary substitutions, such as replacing 'infrequent' with 'does not happen often' and 'design' with 'build', are well-executed. The change from 'collapse' to 'damage' is a reasonable simplification, though it loses a small degree of specificity. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets the B1 criteria.",
