        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. While the simplification successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, as indicated by the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.96), it over-simplified the language. The issue likely stems from reducing phrases like 'news programmes about the war' to the very simple 'the news'. This, combined with a high density of A1/A2 vocabulary, pushed the text below the B1 threshold. Suggestion: To elevate the text to B1, reintroduce slightly more specific vocabulary. For instance, changing 'she still saw the news' to 'she still saw news reports about the war' would add lexical complexity without harming comprehension.",

The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.95) are exceptionally high, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key phrasing. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is very effective; for instance, replacing the phrase 'what was happening in the war' with 'details of the conflict' is a sophisticated use of B1 vocabulary to improve conciseness. Furthermore, adding the connector 'because' in the first sentence clarifies the causal link for the reader, improving overall flow and readability. No further improvements are needed.",
