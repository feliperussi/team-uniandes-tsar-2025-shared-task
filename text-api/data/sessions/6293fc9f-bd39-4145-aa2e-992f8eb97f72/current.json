This does not surprise me. He tells us our most basic stories about ourselves. When you listen to Born in the USA, his 1984 album that describes American life, you hear those stories. Those stories are as relevant today as they ever were.",

    "feedback": "PASS: This is a high-quality simplification that successfully meets all core requirements. Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message. The text correctly achieves a B1 classification. The handling of keywords is exemplary. Defining 'Springsteen' as a 'famous American singer\u2011songwriter' and 'Born in the USA' as 'his 1984 album that describes American life' provides essential context for the B1 reader. The simplification of 'fundamental' to 'basic' is also a good vocabulary choice. For future improvement, consider combining some of the very short sentences to improve flow, but the current version is clear and effective.",
