He also is still at the top of his game, which does not surprise me at all.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. The primary reason for this is the use of overly long and complex sentences. For example, the first sentence, 'Unlike many other best\u2011selling album, Springsteen, a famous American singer\u2011songwriter, is still releasing chart\u2011topping, stadium\u2011filling new music even though he is in his late 60s,' is too complex for a B1 reader. It combines multiple grammatical structures (an appositive phrase, compound adjectives, a subordinate clause) into a single unit. While the keyword definitions for 'Springsteen' and 'Born in the USA' were factually correct, inserting them directly into long sentences increased the complexity. Suggestion: Break down complex sentences and provide definitions in separate, simple sentences. For instance: 'Springsteen is a famous American singer-songwriter. He is still releasing popular new music even though he is in his late 60s.' This approach maintains factual accuracy while adhering to B1-level sentence structure.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message. The text correctly achieves a B1 classification. The handling of keywords is exemplary. Defining 'Springsteen' as a 'famous American singer\u2011songwriter' and 'Born in the USA' as 'his 1984 album that describes American life' provides essential context for the B1 reader. The simplification of 'fundamental' to 'basic' is also a good vocabulary choice. For future improvement, consider combining some of the very short sentences to improve flow, but the current version is clear and effective.",
