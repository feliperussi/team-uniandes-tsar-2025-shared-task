The use of 'Although' to begin the first sentence creates a complex sentence with a subordinate clause, which is a grammatical structure more typical of the B2 level. Additionally, the B2-level vocabulary word 'collapse' was retained from the original text. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, restructure the first sentence. For example: 'Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. However, this kind of collapse is not very common, especially with modern ones.' This uses a simpler structure and a common B1 connector."

However, it fails on the third priority check. The output was classified by the metrics as 'A2', which is below the required B1 target level, indicating an over-simplification. The linguistic evidence for this is the replacement of B1/B2 level vocabulary ('collapse', 'infrequent') with simpler A1/A2 phrases ('falling down', 'not very common'). While the resulting text is clear, it lacks the lexical complexity expected for a B1 learner. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, retain some of the more precise original vocabulary. For example, the word 'collapse' is a key term that a B1 learner would understand in this context. Keeping it would have maintained the text at the appropriate CEFR level."
