    "text_translated": "The Scallion, which is a newspaper, is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of about 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. A survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, to make their culture richer, and for work experience. However, the cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9807 both significantly exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. The writer effectively addressed the keyword 'Scallion' by providing an in-context definition ('which is a newspaper'), enhancing clarity for the target audience. Simplifications such as changing 'approximately' to 'about' and 'cultural enrichment' to 'to make their culture richer' are appropriate and contribute to the B1 readability without losing nuance. The addition of 'However' as a discourse marker improves the flow and cohesion of the text. While the B2 vocabulary candidates 'faculty' and 'furthermore' were retained, the overall text structure and vocabulary choices are well-suited for a B1 learner. For future refinement, consider if 'faculty buildings' could be simplified to 'university buildings' or 'department buildings' for even greater accessibility, though its current form is acceptable within B1.",
