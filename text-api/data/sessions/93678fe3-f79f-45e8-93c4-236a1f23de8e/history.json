About 10,000 students read it, and students completely write and make it. A survey shows that students and staff at the university like the newspaper very much for fun, for culture, and for work experience. However, making copies of the newspaper costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot easily get the paper because they can only get a copy if they go to the university. Another problem for the environment is that many copies become rubbish on the university area.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message or nuance. Specifically, the phrase 'cultural enrichment' in the original text, which implies an active benefit of making something better or more complete, was simplified to 'for culture'. This simplification loses the deeper meaning of the positive impact the newspaper has. While simplification is the goal, it must not come at the expense of the original's core message or the depth of its meaning. To improve, ensure that simplified phrases retain the full semantic weight of the original, even if expressed in simpler terms. For example, 'cultural enrichment' could be simplified to 'to help students learn more about culture' or 'to make their culture richer' to better preserve the meaning of 'enrichment'.",

A survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, to make their culture richer, and for work experience. However, the cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9807 both significantly exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. The writer effectively addressed the keyword 'Scallion' by providing an in-context definition ('which is a newspaper'), enhancing clarity for the target audience. Simplifications such as changing 'approximately' to 'about' and 'cultural enrichment' to 'to make their culture richer' are appropriate and contribute to the B1 readability without losing nuance. The addition of 'However' as a discourse marker improves the flow and cohesion of the text. While the B2 vocabulary candidates 'faculty' and 'furthermore' were retained, the overall text structure and vocabulary choices are well-suited for a B1 learner. For future refinement, consider if 'faculty buildings' could be simplified to 'university buildings' or 'department buildings' for even greater accessibility, though its current form is acceptable within B1.",
