This indicates a slight but critical loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the meaning is largely preserved, the lexical choices and additions deviate too much from the original wording to meet the strict fidelity requirement. Specific deviations include: 1. The phrase 'depends on your point of view' was replaced with 'People have different ideas about this', which is a lexical shift. 2. The specific term 'fines' was replaced with the more general 'money', reducing lexical precision. 3. The phrase 'complain about the high cost' was replaced with 'are unhappy. Cleaning graffiti costs a lot of money', which alters the original phrasing and lexical density. 4. The introduction of definitions for 'graffiti' and 'vandalism' at the beginning, while helpful for A2, adds content not present in the original text, contributing to the lower BERTScore. Suggestion: Ensure that while simplifying, the core vocabulary and phrasing from the original text are retained as much as possible to maintain a high BERTScore. Avoid adding new information that was not in the original source when aiming for high fidelity.",

While the vocabulary is appropriate for A2, the sentence structure is not consistently simple enough. The sentence 'In many countries, if people write or paint on public places or on other people's things, it is vandalism.' is too long and structurally complex for an A2 level. The combination of a conditional clause with multiple prepositional phrases within a single sentence pushes it into B1 territory. A2 requires shorter, more direct sentences that convey one main idea at a time. Suggestion: Split the complex conditional sentence into two or more simpler sentences to reduce its length and structural load. For example, 'In many countries, people write or paint on public places. They also paint on other people's things. This is vandalism.' or 'In many countries, it is vandalism. This happens if people write or paint on public places or on other people's things.'",
