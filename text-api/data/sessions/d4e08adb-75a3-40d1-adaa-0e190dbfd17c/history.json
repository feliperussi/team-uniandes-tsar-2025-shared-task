Young people fight to survive.' add information that is not in the original text. Your task is to simplify the source material, not to add external knowledge or plot summaries.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8882 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing. The original's 'merge together in a disturbing way' was replaced by 'began to join. It felt scary.', which loses the specific meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'survive' was used. This is not A2-level vocabulary. It must be replaced.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove all sentences not directly derived from the original text. Replace the word 'survive' with an A2-level phrase like 'stay alive'. Re-evaluate the text to ensure key concepts from the original are preserved with higher fidelity.",

Simplification Success: The replacement of 'merge' with 'mix' and 'disturbing' with 'scary' was appropriate for the A2 level. Suggestion: The vocabulary failure is absolute.
