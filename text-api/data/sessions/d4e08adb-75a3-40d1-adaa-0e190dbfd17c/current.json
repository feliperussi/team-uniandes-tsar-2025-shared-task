    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n- Factual Accuracy: The output preserves all key facts from the original text without error.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The use of 'scary' for 'disturbing' and 'mix' for 'merge' is appropriate.\n- Structural Simplicity: The original text's complex sentences have been correctly deconstructed into a series of short, simple sentences suitable for an A2 reader. The explanation of 'reality shows' as 'shows with real people, not people who act' is an exemplary simplification.\n- Metrics: All metrics are within the required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.85 and BERTScore at 0.90 confirm high fidelity to the source.",
