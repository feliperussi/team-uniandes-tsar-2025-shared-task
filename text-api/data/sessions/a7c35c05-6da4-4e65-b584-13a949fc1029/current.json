    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct failure of the primary objective. The vocabulary used is too advanced for an A2 learner. Specifically, the word 'annual' is a B1 level word. The word 'turnover' is a C1 level word, which is significantly above the A2 standard. The phrase 'employee turnover' is therefore too complex. The text must strictly adhere to A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. Suggestion: Replace 'annual employee turnover' with simpler A2 phrasing such as 'how many people leave the company each year'. Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2 level.",

This means 12 people out of 100 leave. The usual number for companies like ours is 7%. So, our `turnover` is high.\n\nThe main aim of this report is to find out why workers feel `employee engagement`. The report will offer ideas.
