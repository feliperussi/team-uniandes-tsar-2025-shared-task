It will also find out why people stay.', losing specific terms like 'principal objective', 'investigate', 'causes of employee engagement', and 'within the firm'.\n- 'offer recommendations to improve the employees' experience of the workplace and increase employee retention' was broken down and simplified, losing the specific phrasing of 'offer recommendations' and 'improve the employees' experience of the workplace'.\n\nSuggestion: While simplifying for A2, you must retain more of the original's specific vocabulary and phrasing where possible to meet the BERTScore threshold. For instance, instead of 'find out why people leave', consider 'find out why workers leave their jobs'.

For A2, this should be rephrased, e.g., 'every year'.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'standard' (B1) is used without simplification or definition. For A2, this should be rephrased, e.g., 'what is normal for other companies'.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'workplace' (B2) is used without simplification or definition. For A2, this should be rephrased, e.g., 'the place where people work' or 'the office'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to maintain a higher degree of lexical and structural similarity to the original while still adhering to A2 simplicity.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6386 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core meaning of the original text has been diluted. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8856 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of lexical fidelity. This text fails to accurately convey the original message at an A2 level. Deviations are as follows: 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The concept of 'employee engagement' (a complex idea involving commitment and motivation) has been oversimplified to 'why workers feel good about their jobs'. This loses the depth and professional context of the original meaning. 2. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low due to the replacement of specific, important terms with overly generic phrases. For example, 'industry standard' was replaced with 'For other companies', losing the specific benchmark concept. 'Investigate the causes of employee engagement' was reduced to 'find out why workers feel good about their jobs', which is a significant lexical and conceptual shift. 'Increase employee retention' was simplified to 'help more workers to stay', losing the specific business term 'retention'. 3. Vocabulary Imprecision: While aiming for A2, the chosen replacements are too vague and do not adequately represent the original terms. 'Turnover' is explained, but 'engagement' and 'retention' are not sufficiently captured. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to maintain the core meaning of 'employee engagement' and 'employee retention' using simple A2 definitions or explanations, rather than replacing them with less precise concepts. Ensure that key terms like 'industry standard' are conveyed with equivalent A2 phrasing that retains the original meaning. Focus on preserving the specific information and professional context of the original text while simplifying the language.",

The BERTScore of 0.884 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. This text does not meet the A2 standard for content preservation.\n\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's objective to \"investigate the causes of employee engagement\" and \"increase employee retention\" is diluted. Your version \"find out why workers want to work hard and stay at Girox Foods\" merges these distinct concepts too broadly. The specific focus on 'engagement' as a driver for 'retention' is lost.\n*   Lexical Fidelity Failure: Critical terms such as \"employee turnover,\" \"industry standard,\" \"principal objective,\" \"employee engagement,\" \"recommendations,\" \"improve the employees' experience of the workplace,\" and \"employee retention\" are either omitted or replaced with less precise A1 vocabulary. For example, \"turnover\" is explained but not used, and \"retention\" is only vaguely implied by \"help Girox Foods keep its workers.\" The phrase \"This is the normal number\" for \"industry standard\" is an oversimplification that loses the specific meaning of a benchmark.\n*   Structural Simplification: The original's formal objective (\"The principal objective of this report is to investigate... and... offer recommendations\") is reduced to an informal \"This report wants to find out... It will give ideas.\" This loses the professional tone and specific purpose of the report.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the specific concepts of 'employee engagement' and 'employee retention' by explaining them in simple A2 terms. Reintroduce the formal purpose of the report, stating it will 'look into reasons' and 'give ideas to make things better' while retaining the core lexical items where possible without exceeding A2 complexity. The explanation of 'industry standard' needs to be more precise than 'normal number'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, despite preserving the core meaning. While simplification is necessary for A2, the extensive rephrasing and introduction of explicit definitions for 'turnover' and 'retention' led to a reduced lexical overlap with the source material. For example, 'an annual employee turnover of about 12 per cent' was rephrased as '12 out of 100 people leave every year', and 'the industry standard is seven per cent' became 'Other companies usually have 7 people leave. This is the usual number for all companies.' These changes, while simplifying, deviate too much from the original phrasing. Suggestion: Maintain closer lexical fidelity to the original text while simplifying sentence structure and vocabulary. Avoid introducing entirely new sentences for definitions if the original phrasing can be directly simplified to convey the same information with more lexical overlap.",
