This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The simplification process has destroyed the meaning.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text is a formal recommendation based on findings. Your version, 'We have new information. So, we think Girox Foods should change,' is overly simplistic and loses the professional weight and specific meaning of a recommendation. The concept of a 'people-oriented management style' is a central idea that has been completely erased.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8888 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of removing, rather than simplifying, key factual phrases. Terms like 'positive reinforcement', 'recognition', and 'intercultural communication' were deleted, damaging the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Structural Issue: While the sentence structure is simple, the simplification has made the text choppy and disconnected. The logical flow from 'findings' to 'recommendation' is gone.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to preserve the original meaning. Restore the concept of a formal recommendation. Rephrase to include the idea of a 'people-oriented' approach. Do not simply delete key concepts like 'positive reinforcement' and 'intercultural communication'; find A2 ways to express them. For example, 'saying good job' is a weak substitute for 'positive reinforcement and recognition'.",

This is a direct result of replacing specific business concepts with overly general terms.\n- Meaning Loss (Reinforcement): The original specifies 'positive reinforcement and recognition'. Your version, 'show staff that their work is good and important', is a vague interpretation that loses the specific management action being recommended.\n- Meaning Loss (Challenge): The original suggests managers 'challenge our staff'. Your version, 'give staff difficult work', changes the meaning from a positive opportunity for growth to a potentially negative task.\n- Lexical Simplification Error: Key terms like 'professional development' and 'social and intercultural communication' were replaced with 'training' and 'talk to other people better'. This oversimplification caused the drop in both meaning and fidelity scores.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. You must preserve the specific meaning of key concepts from the original. Restore the concepts of 'positive reinforcement', 'recognition', and 'professional development' using simple A2 language without losing their meaning. For example, instead of 'show staff their work is good', use 'tell workers they did a good job often'.",
