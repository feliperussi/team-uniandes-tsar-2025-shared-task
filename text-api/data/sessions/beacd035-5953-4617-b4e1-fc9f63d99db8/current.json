The BERTScore of 0.8832 is below the required 0.90 and key phrases like prophecy and choosing to forget are missing. Suggestion: Reintroduce the concept of prophecy using simple A2 terms. Suggestion: Restore key vocabulary from the original text such as prophecy and choose to forget. Suggestion: Keep more of the original sentence structure to preserve the full meaning.",
