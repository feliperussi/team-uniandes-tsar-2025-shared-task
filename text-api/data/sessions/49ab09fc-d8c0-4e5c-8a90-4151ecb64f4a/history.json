Specifically, the non-defining relative clause in the first sentence ('...asteroids, which are at least 140 metres wide.') and the embedded question in the fifth sentence ('...showed how dangerous a 19-metre asteroid can be.') increase the complexity. To ensure a B1 classification, consider simplifying these structures. For example, the first sentence could be split into two: 'NASA is tracking smaller asteroids. These asteroids are at least 140 metres wide.' Despite the CEFR classification, the simplification is excellent in all other aspects.

While the simplification strategy of splitting the long final sentence was excellent and the vocabulary choices were appropriate, the resulting text likely has too high a density of complex grammatical structures for a B1 level. The paragraph contains a relative clause ('asteroids that are...'), a compound sentence, a noun clause ('showed that...'), and a conditional clause ('if they enter...'). This combination likely pushed the classification to B2. Suggestion: To lower the complexity, simplify one of these structures further. For example, change the first sentence to 'NASA is tracking smaller asteroids. These asteroids are at least 140 metres wide.' This would reduce the grammatical density and help achieve the target B1 classification. The submission is commended for its perfect factual accuracy and high meaning preservation scores.",

While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the core meaning, it has been oversimplified. The output consists of a series of very short, simple sentences that lack the complexity and flow expected at a B1 level. For example, the sentences 'They have recorded only about 8,000. That means about 17,000 are still unknown.' are choppy. To correct this, combine sentences using B1-level connectors to create more complex structures and improve readability.
