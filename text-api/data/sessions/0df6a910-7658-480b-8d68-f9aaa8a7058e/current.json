    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6243 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8914 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text describes formal research ('a global survey conducted by', 'responses were collected', 'participated in a study'). Your version simplifies this to 'did a survey' and 'answered questions'. This changes the meaning from a formal data collection process to a simple question-and-answer session, which is a significant semantic shift.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: Key phrases from the original were oversimplified, losing lexical fidelity. 'Perceptions of the threats and opportunities' became 'dangers and the good chances', and 'career development' became 'how to get a better job'. These changes are too distant from the source text, causing the score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification is too aggressive and has damaged the core meaning. Rephrase to retain the concept of a formal 'study'. For example, use 'people gave answers for a study' instead of 'people answered questions'. To improve fidelity, use phrasing that is closer to the original, such as 'what they think about problems and good chances at work' instead of 'dangers and the good chances they see in their jobs'.",
