This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8881, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5578 demonstrates that the simplification process has removed essential concepts. The original text specifies 'global surveys' about 'perceptions of threats and opportunities'. Your version reduces this to 'a big study' about 'ideas' and 'good things and bad things'. This is an unacceptable loss of meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8881 confirms a loss of lexical fidelity. Key factual terms from the original, such as 'global', 'survey', 'perceptions', 'threats', and 'opportunities', were completely removed instead of being simplified. This damages the text's connection to the source material.\n\n- Diagnostic Analysis: The attempt to simplify was too aggressive. While the resulting text uses A1/A2 vocabulary and sentence structures, it do so at the cost of the original message. The concept of a 'global' study is a key fact that was omitted. The nuance between 'perceptions' and 'ideas' was lost.\n\n- Suggestion: Re-write the text. You must reintroduce the concept that the studies were 'worldwide' or 'in many countries'. You must find a more accurate A2-level phrasing for 'perceptions of threats and opportunities', such as 'what they think is good and bad for jobs' or 'what they see as problems and chances at work'.",
