Classifier rated B1, not A2.\n- Found B2 word \"potentially\" in sentence 1.\n- Found B2 word \"means\" in sentence 3.\n- Sentence 1 uses the relative clause \"that might be dangerous\", a B1 structure.\nSuggestion: Replace \"potentially\" with \"maybe\". Remove the clause by using two simple sentences (e.g., \u201cA PHA is a space rock. It might be dangerous.\u201d). Change \"means\" to \"is\". Limit connectors to and, but, so, because.",
