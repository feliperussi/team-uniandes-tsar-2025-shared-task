    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.92) confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are very effective, particularly the decision to split the long sentence about the Sydney funnel-web spider into two shorter, clearer sentences. The in-text definition provided for this keyword was also a very strong choice. The only area for improvement is a minor grammatical error in subject-verb agreement. The text states: 'The Sydney funnel\u2011web spider... are famous...'. Since the subject 'spider' is singular, the verb should be 'is'. The corrected phrase is: 'The Sydney funnel\u2011web spider... is famous...'. Correcting this small error would make the submission nearly perfect.",
