Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, split the complex sentence into two simpler ones, for example: 'These irritating hairs can embed.

The classifier rated the output as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. This is likely due to several factors. First, the C1-level word 'notorious' from the original text was kept. For a B1 level, this should have been replaced with a simpler phrase like 'famous for being dangerous'. Second, the sentence 'It has not caused any fatalities...' uses the word 'fatalities', which is more complex than the simpler alternative 'deaths'. Finally, the last two sentences, 'These irritating hairs can stick. This shows they get stuck in the skin or eyes of the attacker,' are grammatically awkward and unnatural. The phrase 'This shows...' is confusing. A better B1 simplification of the original 'embed themselves' would be a single sentence like 'These irritating hairs can get stuck in an attacker's skin or eyes.'",

This failure occurred despite the text passing the higher-priority checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation. The B2 classification is likely due to complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'It has not caused any deaths since anti-venom was created in 1981' uses a passive voice construction ('was created') combined with a 'since' clause, which is a feature of B2 level grammar. Additionally, the first sentence is long and contains a relative clause with a dropped pronoun ('the animals they catch'), which increases its complexity. To correct this, simplify the complex sentences. Suggestion: Change 'since anti-venom was created in 1981' to 'since 1981. In that year, a special medicine called anti-venom was created.' This breaks the complex structure into two simpler B1 sentences. On a positive note, the strategy for defining the keyword 'Sydney funnel-web spider' in context was very effective.",
