There seems to be only a weak connection between the number of native speakers a language has and the number of people who learn it, but there is a stronger link between the number of learners and how many countries have speakers.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.88) and BERTScore (0.97) are both well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key phrasing. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The vocabulary substitutions are particularly effective; replacing 'correlation' with 'connection' and 'Overall' with 'Generally' are perfect examples of reducing complexity while retaining precise meaning for a B1 audience. The output is clear, fluent, and serves as a model for successful text simplification.",
