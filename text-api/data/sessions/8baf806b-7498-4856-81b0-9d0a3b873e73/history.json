The text is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, as shown by the high BERTScore (0.96) and MeaningBERT (0.88) scores. However, the simplification was too effective, resulting in a text that is linguistically too simple for the B1 level. This is likely because key B1/B2 vocabulary such as 'correlation' and 'overall' were replaced with simpler A2/B1 alternatives like 'connection' and 'in general'. To meet the B1 requirement, consider reintroducing slightly more complex but still clear vocabulary. For instance, 'There seems to be a weak connection' could be a suitable B1 alternative to 'There does not seem to be a strong connection'.",

The MeaningBERT (0.88) and BERTScore (0.97) are both well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key phrasing. The CEFR B1 classification is accurate. The vocabulary substitutions are particularly effective; replacing 'correlation' with 'connection' and 'Overall' with 'Generally' are perfect examples of reducing complexity while retaining precise meaning for a B1 audience. The output is clear, fluent, and serves as a model for successful text simplification.",
