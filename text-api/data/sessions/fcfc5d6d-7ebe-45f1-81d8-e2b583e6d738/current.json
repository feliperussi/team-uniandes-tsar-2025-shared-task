    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is an event that happens every year. The Capitol uses the games to do something bad to the people in the districts. The districts are the different parts of the country. The Capitol does something bad to them because they fought against the government. Every year, the Capitol chooses one boy and one girl from each district by chance. They are between 12 and 18 years old. People call these young people 'tributes'. A tribute is a person who must fight in the games. They all fight, but only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country must watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "This is a flawless A2 text. The writer correctly identified and replaced complex vocabulary (punish -> do something bad; rebelling -> fought against the government; lottery -> by chance; survive -> stay alive). The necessary keywords 'districts' and 'tributes' were defined immediately in simple terms, which is the correct procedure. Sentence structure is simple, declarative, and perfectly suited for the A2 level. Factual accuracy is maintained. No errors.",
