Instead of 'punish', use a simpler A2 phrase like 'do something bad to'. The text uses the passive voice in 'are chosen' and 'are called'. This structure is too complex for A2.

The writer correctly identified and replaced complex vocabulary (punish -> do something bad; rebelling -> fought against the government; lottery -> by chance; survive -> stay alive). The necessary keywords 'districts' and 'tributes' were defined immediately in simple terms, which is the correct procedure. Sentence structure is simple, declarative, and perfectly suited for the A2 level. Factual accuracy is maintained. No errors."
