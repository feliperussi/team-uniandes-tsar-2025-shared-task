    "text_translated": "Genes are small parts inside our body. They decide things like our hair color. Scientists want to know what genes do for our brain and language. Did a change in our genes give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in one gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected with speaking. It is also connected with how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not have this change. We do not know everything yet. But one day, we might find the answers in our DNA. DNA is where our genes are.",

    "feedback": "The text is a perfect example of A2 simplification. It correctly identifies 'genes' as a key term and provides a simple, effective definition at the beginning. The related term 'DNA' is also defined simply at the end. All sentences are short, declarative, and use high-frequency A2 vocabulary. The factual content of the original text is perfectly preserved. No corrections are necessary.",
