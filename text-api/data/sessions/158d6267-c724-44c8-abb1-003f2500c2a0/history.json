Did a change in our genes give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in one gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be linked to speaking. It is also linked to how our brains move our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not have this change. We do not know everything yet. But one day, we might find the answers in our DNA. DNA is where our genes are.",

An A2 text must exclusively use A2 vocabulary. The goal is not to teach B1 words, but to communicate using words the learner already knows. While the sentence structure is appropriately simple, the vocabulary errors result in an immediate failure."
