The text fails to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6188 is significantly below the required 0.75. The nuanced message of the original text, particularly regarding specific societal pressures, detailed stereotypes, and the psychological impact on girls (confidence, sense of belonging), has been overly simplified and diluted. For example, 'crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut' is reduced to 'strange, very clever, go to space', losing the specific archetypes. 'More confidence and a greater sense of belonging' is reduced to 'feel better' and 'fit in', which is a significant loss of the original's depth.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8762 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. Specific terms like 'humanities', 'physics', 'geeky', 'poor social skills', 'lonely and detached from the rest of the world', 'false stereotypes', and 'unappealing career path' were replaced with more generic and less precise A1/A2 vocabulary, leading to a loss of lexical detail.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification process. While aiming for A2, ensure that the core concepts and specific details are preserved, even if rephrased. Do not sacrifice the essence of the message for simplicity. Focus on retaining the specific examples of stereotypes and the precise nature of the impact on girls' career choices and self-perception. For example, instead of 'strange', consider 'not normal' or 'a bit odd' to capture 'geeky' or 'crazy'. For 'confidence and belonging', try 'feel strong and like they are part of the group'.",

The simplified text loses the nuance of 'unfortunate perception' and 'false stereotypes portrayed by the media', replacing it with a more direct statement of what people think, which dilutes the original message about societal influence and media portrayal. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8865 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key lexical detail and phrasing from the original text. This failure at Priority 2 means the text does not adequately preserve the core message and fidelity of the original.\n\nSpecific deviations:\n- The critical concept of 'unfortunate perception' and 'false stereotypes portrayed by the media' from the original text is simplified to 'People also think scientists are strange' and 'These ideas are wrong. Films and TV show these wrong ideas.' This simplification loses the crucial nuance of how these ideas are formed and perpetuated, impacting the core meaning.\n- Key terms and phrases such as 'role models', 'genius inventor', 'adventurous astronaut', 'geeky', 'poor social skills', 'lonely and detached from the rest of the world', 'confidence', and 'greater sense of belonging' were either omitted or replaced with less precise A1/A2 equivalents. For example, 'role models' became 'good women', and 'confidence' became 'feel more sure', which diminishes the original's lexical richness and specific meaning.\n- The original's cohesive structure, such as 'Coupled with this is...', which links ideas, is lost in the fragmented sentence structure. While simplification is necessary for A2, the complete breakdown of logical connections impacts the overall meaning flow and fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: Reintroduce the concept of 'perception' and 'stereotypes' using A2-appropriate language. Ensure that the specific negative attributes of scientists (e.g., 'geeky', 'poor social skills') are conveyed, even if simplified. Retain more of the original's key vocabulary where possible, or define them clearly if they are above A2. Re-evaluate sentence combining to maintain logical connections between ideas without increasing complexity beyond A2.",

While the text successfully simplifies to an A2 level, as confirmed by the CEFR classifier, it sacrifices too much lexical fidelity. The instruction is to preserve the core message AND key words/factual phrasing. Your output fails on the latter. Specific deviations include: the replacement of 'humanities' with 'arts'; the omission of 'positive' from 'positive female role models'; the change from 'youngsters' to 'young people'; the simplification of 'science-related jobs' to 'science jobs'; the substitution of 'Cartoons and stories' with 'Books and films'; the change from 'genius inventor' to 'clever inventors'; the rephrasing of 'adventurous astronaut' to 'brave astronauts who go to space'; the replacement of 'unfortunate perception' with 'wrong ideas'; the substitution of 'geeky' with 'strange'; the rephrasing of 'poor social skills' to 'not good at talking to people'; the rephrasing of 'detached from the rest of the world' to 'not connected to the world'; the change from 'portrayed by the media' to 'Films and TV show these wrong stereotypes'; the rephrasing of 'identify with scientists' to 'feel like scientists'; the rephrasing of 'unappealing career path' to 'do not want to choose science for a job'; and the rephrasing of 'greater sense of belonging' to 'feel more like they belong'. These numerous lexical alterations, while simplifying the text, collectively reduce the fidelity to the original's specific wording below the acceptable threshold.

It did not meet the required A2 standard.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8883 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the meaning was largely preserved, the lexical choices deviated too much. For example, 'favour arts and humanities' was replaced with 'like arts and humanities', 'leave maths and physics to the boys' became 'boys should like maths and physics', 'genius inventor' became 'very clever inventor', and 'unappealing career path' became 'not want to choose science for a job'. These replacements, while simpler, reduce the lexical overlap required for a high BERTScore.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. This is due to the presence of several words above the A2 level:\n  - 'confidence' (B1) is used in the sentence 'they would feel more confidence'.\n  - 'astronaut' (B1) is used in the sentence 'Or they are an astronaut who likes adventure'.\n  - 'related' (B1) is used in the phrase 'science-related jobs'.\n  - 'stereotype' (C1) is used multiple times, for example, 'These bad ideas are called stereotypes'. Even with a definition provided, the word itself is too advanced for A2.\n  - 'geeky' (B1/B2) is used in the sentence 'People think scientists are geeky'.\n  - 'social skills' (B1/B2) is used in the sentence 'They think scientists have poor social skills'.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- To improve BERTScore, rephrase sentences to use more direct lexical equivalents from the original text where possible, without increasing complexity. For example, instead of 'boys should like maths and physics', consider 'boys should do and maths and physics'.\n- To achieve A2 CEFR compliance, eliminate all vocabulary above the A2 level. Replace 'confidence' with phrases like 'feel sure about themselves' or 'feel good about themselves'. Replace 'astronaut' with 'person who goes to space'. Rephrase 'science-related jobs' to 'jobs about science'. Remove the word 'stereotype' entirely and only describe the concept using A2 vocabulary, such as 'wrong ideas about people'. Replace 'geeky' with 'not very social' or 'not good at talking to people'. Replace 'social skills' with 'talking to people'.",
