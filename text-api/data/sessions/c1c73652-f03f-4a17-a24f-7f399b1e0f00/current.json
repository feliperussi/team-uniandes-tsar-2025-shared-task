    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8925 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the core meaning is preserved, the lexical choices deviate too much from the source material. Specific examples of this lexical drift include: 'favour arts and humanities' was simplified to 'do arts and humanities', 'leave maths and physics to the boys' became 'boys should do maths and physics', 'science-related jobs' was reduced to 'science jobs', 'genius inventor' was rephrased as 'clever people who make things', 'adventurous astronaut' became 'people who travel in space', 'unfortunate perception' was changed to 'wrong ideas', 'false stereotypes' became 'false ideas', 'identify with scientists' was rephrased as 'feel like scientists', and 'unappealing career path' was simplified to 'do not want science as a job. It does not look good to them'. These substitutions, while simplifying the language, collectively reduced the lexical overlap below the acceptable threshold. Suggestion: When simplifying for A2, prioritize retaining the original key nouns, adjectives, and verbs as much as possible, or use their most direct A2 synonyms, to maintain higher lexical fidelity.",
