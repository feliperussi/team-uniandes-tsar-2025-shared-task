    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games is a hugely successful book for teenagers and young adults by the American author Suzanne Collins, which has sold millions of copies around the world and been translated into 26 different languages since it was published in 2008. It is also the first book for young readers that has sold more than a million electronic copies. The Hunger Games has now been made into a major Hollywood film that is just as successful, making 152.5 million dollars in North America alone during its opening weekend.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.95 and BERTScore of 0.98 are excellent, confirming that the core message and key details were fully preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The most notable success is the structural improvement; the writer skillfully combined the original short sentences into more complex, fluent B1-level sentences using a relative clause ('which has sold') and a participle clause ('making 152.5 million dollars'). This demonstrates a strong command of B1 grammar and improves the overall flow of the text. The decision to retain the B2-level words 'making' and 'opening' was also correct, as they are part of natural collocations essential for meaning and fluency.",
