While the simplification successfully preserved all facts and the core meaning, it was too aggressive. The original text was already at a low B1 level. By changing words like 'hugely' to 'very' and 'major' to 'important', the output lost the vocabulary complexity needed to remain at the B1 level. To correct this, the writer should be more selective in their vocabulary simplification, especially when the original text is already close to the target CEFR level. Retaining a word like 'major' would likely have been sufficient to meet the B1 requirement.",

While the text passes the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with excellent scores, it fails to meet the specific complexity level required by the task. The linguistic analysis shows that the output text, which is nearly identical to the original, relies on simple sentence structures and vocabulary predominantly at the A1/A2 level. The minor grammatical adjustments made were insufficient to elevate the text to a B1 standard. The core failure was not producing a text that registers as B1, even if that meant the original text required very little change.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.95 and BERTScore of 0.98 are excellent, confirming that the core message and key details were fully preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The most notable success is the structural improvement; the writer skillfully combined the original short sentences into more complex, fluent B1-level sentences using a relative clause ('which has sold') and a participle clause ('making 152.5 million dollars'). This demonstrates a strong command of B1 grammar and improves the overall flow of the text. The decision to retain the B2-level words 'making' and 'opening' was also correct, as they are part of natural collocations essential for meaning and fluency.",
