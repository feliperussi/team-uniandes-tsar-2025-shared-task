    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8835 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases were over-simplified, causing the score drop. For example, 'the world's highest mountains' was reduced to 'high mountains', losing important lexical detail. The phrase 'satellite phones' was simplified to 'special phones that work anywhere', which also contributed to the loss of fidelity.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'used', which is a B1 level verb. All vocabulary must be strictly A2.\n\nSuggestion: Restore more specific phrasing from the original text to meet the fidelity requirement. Replace the B1 word 'used' with an A2 construction. Example: 'In the past, adventurers had maps and compasses'.",
