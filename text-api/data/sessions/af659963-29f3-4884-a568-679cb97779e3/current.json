    "text_translated": "It is common to see small animals like birds and squirrels in many cities. But in recent years, the news has reported something new. More wild animals are coming into cities. For example, people have seen bears in Vancouver parks. They have also seen large wild cats on the streets of Mumbai. Wild pigs have appeared in gardens in Berlin.
