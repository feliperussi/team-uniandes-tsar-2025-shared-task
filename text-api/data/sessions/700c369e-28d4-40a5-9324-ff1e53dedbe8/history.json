The MeaningBERT score of 0.6766 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original text's core message and relationships. The BERTScore of 0.90 is acceptable, but meaning is paramount. Specific deviations are detailed below. The text also contains a B2 word. 1. Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text explicitly states, 'People might not realise they are part of the disposable clothing problem because they donate their unwanted clothes to charities.' Your version states, 'People do not know they are part of this problem. They give their old clothes to charity shops.' This removes the crucial causal link ('because') between their donation habits and their unawareness, fundamentally altering the meaning. 2. Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text establishes a clear causal chain from the characteristics of 'fast fashion' (goes out of fashion quickly, poor quality, not wanted second-hand) directly leading to 'Huge quantities end up being thrown away' and subsequent problems. Your version fragments these ideas into separate statements, weakening the direct cause-and-effect relationship that is central to the original's argument. 3. Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'means' is classified as B2 in your provided vocabulary list. For A2, simpler phrasing like 'is' or 'is when' should be used to define terms. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to explicitly state the causal relationship between people's actions (donating clothes) and their unawareness of contributing to the problem. Suggestion: Reconstruct sentences to clearly link the characteristics of fast fashion to the large-scale disposal problem. Suggestion: Replace 'means' with an A2-appropriate phrase like 'is' or 'is when'.",

Meaning and fidelity are absolute priorities. \n\n*   Meaning Preservation: The original text strongly links the 'disposable clothing problem' to the inability of charities to sell clothes, which then directly leads to clothes being sent abroad and causing 'economic and environmental problems'. Your version separates these ideas into distinct paragraphs, diluting the direct causal chain and the overall emphasis on the interconnectedness of these issues. The phrase 'So, these clothes are still a problem' is vague and does not fully capture the specific, severe consequences highlighted in the original. \n*   Lexical Fidelity: Key terms from the original were replaced with less precise or less specific phrasing. For example, 'economic and environmental problems' was simplified to 'money problems and problems for nature'. While these are A2 terms, they do not preserve the specific factual phrasing of the original, contributing to the low BERTScore. \n*   Lexical Fidelity: The term 'unwanted clothes' from the original was replaced with 'old clothes'. 'Unwanted' carries a specific nuance about the reason for donation that 'old' does not fully capture. \n*   Lexical Fidelity: The phrase 'Huge quantities' was simplified to 'many', which reduces the emphasis on the scale of the problem. \n*   Structural Fidelity: The original text uses a more cohesive flow to explain the problem, its causes, and consequences. Your version breaks the information into shorter, more isolated paragraphs, which, while simpler, disrupts the original's logical progression and the strength of its argument. \n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the structure to maintain the original's causal links more explicitly.

The core message regarding people's misunderstanding of how donating clothes contributes to the 'disposable clothing problem' is significantly weakened. The original text highlights that people 'might not realise they are part of the disposable clothing problem because they donate their unwanted clothes to charities. But charity shops can't sell all those unwanted clothes.' This establishes a direct causal link between the act of donating and the continued problem, implying a false sense of resolution. Your version states 'People do not know they cause a 'disposable clothing problem'. ... They give clothes they do not want to charity shops. But charity shops cannot sell all these clothes.' This separates the idea of 'not knowing' from the specific act of donating as the reason for the lack of awareness, losing the nuanced connection and the implication of a misguided solution. The original's emphasis on the *reason* for not realising is lost. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to explicitly link the act of donating with the misconception that it solves the problem, as in the original text.",
