    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7082 is below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the nuanced reason for people's unawareness of the 'disposable clothing problem' has been lost. The original text explicitly states that people 'might not realise they are part of the disposable clothing problem because they donate their unwanted clothes to charities'. Your version separates these ideas into two independent sentences: 'People give clothes they do not want to charity shops. They do not know they are part of the 'disposable clothing problem'.' This removes the crucial causal link and the implication that donating is the very action that contributes to their unawareness, thus diluting the original's central point about the problem's insidious nature. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to clearly link the act of donating with people's lack of awareness about their contribution to the disposable clothing problem. Ensure the causal relationship is maintained.",
