    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: All numbers, concepts, and logical connections from the original text were preserved with perfect accuracy. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.88 and BERTScore of 0.94 are excellent, indicating that the core message and key phrasing were maintained effectively. CEFR Compliance: The output correctly achieved the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification is very well executed. The replacement of 'coincidence' with 'chance' and 'not too difficult' with 'not hard' are excellent examples of effective B1-level vocabulary substitution. The sentence structure is clear and flows well. The only minor point for consideration is the replacement of the A1 word 'often' with the B1 word 'frequently'; while this is a valid B1 word, retaining the simpler original would also have been an effective strategy. Overall, this is a strong submission.",
