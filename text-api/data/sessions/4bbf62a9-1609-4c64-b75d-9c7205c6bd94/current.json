    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6969 is below the required 0.75. The core meaning and intensity of the original text have been diluted. While the factual information is present, the emotional and descriptive impact is significantly reduced. The BERTScore of 0.9113 indicates good lexical fidelity, but the semantic depth is compromised. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2, but this does not compensate for the loss of meaning. Specific deviations are listed below. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the original's descriptive power and emotional weight without exceeding A2 vocabulary or grammar. Focus on conveying the 'extraordinary' nature of the story and the 'ferocious' aspect of the tiger more effectively. For example, 'wild' is not as strong as 'ferocious'.",
