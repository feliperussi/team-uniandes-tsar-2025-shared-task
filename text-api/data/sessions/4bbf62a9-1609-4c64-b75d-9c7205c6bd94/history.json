Your version omits the specific fact that it is the author's third book. This is a direct factual omission and constitutes an instant failure. Additionally, the Meaning Preservation Failure is significant. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6548 is below the required 0.75.

For example, the original's 'extraordinary story' and 'ferocious tiger' are reduced to 'very special story' and 'wild tiger', which diminishes the intensity and specific detail of the narrative. The original's 'shipwrecked' and 'trapped in a lifeboat' are simplified to 'His boat sank' and 'in a small boat', losing the specific context of the event.

While the text accurately conveys the facts, it fails to preserve the core meaning and impact of the original story. The original text emphasizes the 'extraordinary' nature of the story and the specific situation of Pi being 'trapped' with a 'ferocious' tiger. Your version, by breaking down complex ideas into overly simplistic, disconnected sentences, dilutes this core message. For example, 'extraordinary story' becomes 'amazing story', which, while an A2 word, loses the unique emphasis. The nuance of being 'trapped' is also lost when simply stating 'He was in a small rescue boat'. The overall sense of wonder and peril from the original is not fully captured. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to better convey the 'extraordinary' aspect of the story and the specific, challenging situation of being 'trapped'. Combine related ideas where appropriate to maintain a stronger narrative flow without exceeding A2 complexity. For instance, instead of just 'amazing story', consider 'a very special and surprising story'. To convey 'trapped', you could say 'he could not get out of the boat with a dangerous tiger'.",

While 'surprising' and 'dangerous' are A2 concepts, 'extraordinary' conveys a sense of being remarkable, exceptional, or highly unusual, which is not fully captured by 'surprising and dangerous'. This simplification loses a significant aspect of the story's unique nature as presented in the original. Suggestion: Rephrase to better convey the 'remarkable' or 'exceptional' quality of the story while remaining within A2 vocabulary.",

The simplification of key descriptive elements from the original text, such as 'extraordinary story' to 'very special story' and 'ferocious tiger' to 'very dangerous tiger', diminishes the core impact and specific meaning of the narrative. Additionally, the original's concise phrasing 'shipwrecked and finds himself trapped in a lifeboat... with a ferocious tiger' is broken into multiple, less semantically dense sentences, which further dilutes the original message.

While the individual facts are present, the core meaning and dramatic impact of the original text have been diluted through excessive fragmentation and simplification. The original text conveys a singular, extraordinary predicament of being 'shipwrecked and finds himself trapped in a lifeboat... with a ferocious tiger'. Your version breaks this into several disconnected facts ('His ship sank. Pi was in a small boat... A wild tiger was in the boat too. Pi could not get away from the tiger.'), which loses the cohesive sense of the dire, extraordinary situation. The overall gist and narrative flow are compromised, reducing the fidelity of the message despite lexical simplification. The BERTScore of 0.906 is acceptable, indicating lexical fidelity, but the MeaningBERT failure is critical. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2, but this is irrelevant if the core meaning is not preserved. Suggestion: Rephrase the first paragraph to convey the sense of a single, extraordinary, and dangerous situation more cohesively, rather than listing separate facts. Combine related ideas to maintain the original's narrative impact while keeping sentences simple.",
