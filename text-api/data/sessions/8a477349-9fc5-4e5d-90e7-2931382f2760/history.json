        "feedback_text": "The text fails on two counts. First, the word 'Engineers' is B1 level, a clear violation of the A2 vocabulary rule. A simpler phrase like 'people who build bridges' is required. Second, the sentence 'the bridge was made to hold a certain amount of weight' uses the passive voice. A2 texts must use simple, active sentence structures. These errors make the text unacceptable."

        "feedback_text": "Flawless execution. The text adheres strictly to A2 standards in vocabulary, sentence structure, and factual accuracy. Simplification of concepts like 'engineers' to 'People who build bridges', 'inferior-quality' to 'bad', and 'defect' to 'problem' is exemplary. The avoidance of passive voice ('was used', 'was designed') is perfect. No corrections are necessary."
