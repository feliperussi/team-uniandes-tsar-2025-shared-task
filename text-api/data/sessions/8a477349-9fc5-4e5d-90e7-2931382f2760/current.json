    "text_translated": "Sometimes bridges fall down and we do not know why. People who build bridges have to do a complete study to understand the reason. Sometimes, this happens because people built the bridge with bad material. Or it happens because an important part of the bridge had a problem. In other cases, a bridge can only hold a certain amount of weight. It cannot hold more weight than that.",

    "feedback": "Flawless execution. The text adheres strictly to A2 standards in vocabulary, sentence structure, and factual accuracy. Simplification of concepts like 'engineers' to 'People who build bridges', 'inferior-quality' to 'bad', and 'defect' to 'problem' is exemplary. The avoidance of passive voice ('was used', 'was designed') is perfect. No corrections are necessary.",
