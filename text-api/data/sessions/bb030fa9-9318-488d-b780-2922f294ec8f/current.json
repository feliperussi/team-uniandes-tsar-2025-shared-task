    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6104 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.894 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a failure to retain key phrasing.\n\n*   Meaning Loss: The original's concept of 'challenge our staff' was weakened to 'interesting tasks'. The management term 'positive reinforcement' was oversimplified to 'tell employees when they do a good job', losing its specific meaning. The recommendation for 'Increased investment' was completely omitted.\n*   Vocabulary Violation: The text uses words above the A2 level without justification or definition. 'flexible' is a B2 word. 'location' is a B1 word. 'communication' is a B1 word. These are unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore the concepts of 'challenge' and 'investment'. Replace all words above the A2 level. 'flexible hours' must be rephrased as 'employees can choose their work times'. 'location' must be replaced with 'place'. 'communication' must be simplified to 'talking with people'.",
