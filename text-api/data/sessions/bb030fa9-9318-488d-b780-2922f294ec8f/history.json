This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text is a formal business recommendation. Your output, \"We have some new ideas,\" changes the meaning from a formal proposal to a casual suggestion.\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8818 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing essential professional vocabulary like 'management style', 'investment', 'professional development', and 'recognition'.\n- Consequence of Oversimplification: The concept of 'positive reinforcement and recognition' is a specific management action. Reducing it to 'say \"good job\" more often' loses the professional meaning entirely. Similarly, 'investment in professional development' is a financial and strategic commitment, which is lost when rephrased as 'pay for more training'.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the formal tone of a recommendation. Find A2-level ways to express the key business concepts instead of deleting them. For example, 'positive reinforcement' can be rephrased as 'show workers they are doing good work in clear ways'.",
