    "text_translated": "In the last two centuries, the population has grown very quickly. This happened because improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, which resulted in large families. These families then had even more children who survived into adulthood. However, this situation changed in the 1960s. Contraception, which is a method used to prevent pregnancy, became more widely available. As a result, the global average number of babies per woman fell from six to only two.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that earns a perfect score. It passes all critical checks with high marks. \n\nDIAGNOSIS:\n- Factual Integrity: Perfect. All key information, including dates and statistics (1960s, six to two babies), is accurately preserved.\n- Meaning Preservation: Excellent. The MeaningBERT score of 0.92 confirms that the core message about population change and its causes was fully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: Perfect. The output correctly aligns with the B1 target level, using appropriate sentence structures and vocabulary.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- The simplification of the first sentence is a model of good practice. Restructuring 'fuelling rapid population growth' into 'the population has grown very quickly. This happened because...' makes the cause-and-effect relationship exceptionally clear for a B1 reader.\n- The keyword 'contraception' was defined flawlessly within the text ('which is a method used to prevent pregnancy'), seamlessly integrating the explanation without disrupting the flow.\n- The use of connectors like 'However' and 'As a result' is excellent, guiding the reader through the logical progression of the text.",
