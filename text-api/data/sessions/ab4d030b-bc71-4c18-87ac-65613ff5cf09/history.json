The metrics indicate a final classification of 'A2'. This is likely due to the successful but perhaps overly aggressive simplification of vocabulary and sentence structure, resulting in a text that is simpler than required. While the factual integrity is perfect and the MeaningBERT score of 0.8416 is excellent, the primary goal of hitting the specific CEFR target was not met. To improve, the writer could aim to retain or introduce more B1-level structures or vocabulary without compromising clarity. For example, combining the first two sentences using a relative clause could increase complexity appropriately. On a positive note, the keyword 'contraception' was defined perfectly within the text, which is an exemplary execution of that requirement."

While it successfully passes the critical Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks (MeaningBERT score of 0.91 is excellent), the sentence structure is too advanced for a B1 reader. Both sentences in the output are very long and contain multiple complex clauses (e.g., '...because improvements...meant fewer children died young, which resulted in...'; '...when contraception, which is a method..., became more widely available, causing the global average...'). This level of grammatical complexity is characteristic of a B2 text. To fix this, the writer must break each long sentence into two or three shorter, simpler sentences that focus on a single idea. For example: 'In the last two centuries, the population has grown very quickly. This happened because improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young.' The definition of the keyword 'contraception' was handled correctly, but its integration into an already complex sentence contributed to the B2 classification."

All key information, including dates and statistics (1960s, six to two babies), is accurately preserved.\n- Meaning Preservation: Excellent. The MeaningBERT score of 0.92 confirms that the core message about population change and its causes was fully retained.\n- CEFR Compliance: Perfect. The output correctly aligns with the B1 target level, using appropriate sentence structures and vocabulary.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- The simplification of the first sentence is a model of good practice. Restructuring 'fuelling rapid population growth' into 'the population has grown very quickly. This happened because...' makes the cause-and-effect relationship exceptionally clear for a B1 reader.\n- The keyword 'contraception' was defined flawlessly within the text ('which is a method used to prevent pregnancy'), seamlessly integrating the explanation without disrupting the flow.\n- The use of connectors like 'However' and 'As a result' is excellent, guiding the reader through the logical progression of the text."
