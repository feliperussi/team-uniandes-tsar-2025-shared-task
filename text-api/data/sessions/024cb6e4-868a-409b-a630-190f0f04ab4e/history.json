This is an instant failure. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B2.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low because key concepts were replaced with overly simple and inaccurate words. 'Institutions' is not 'groups'. 'Democracy' is not 'government'. 'World co-operation' is not 'world teamwork'. This simplification damages the original meaning and factual precision.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B2, which is two levels above the A2 target. This is an unacceptable deviation.\n- Vocabulary Violations: The text contains multiple words far above the A2 level. 'Means' is a B2 word. 'Loyalty' is a C1 word. The abstract nouns 'hopelessness' and 'mistrust' are too complex for this level.\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'Pinker says the main problem is that Enlightenment values are under attack' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 structure. This construction is too complex for A2 readers.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original concepts using accurate A2 vocabulary. Remove all B1 and higher vocabulary immediately. The list 'group loyalty, hopelessness, and mistrust' must be completely rewritten using simple descriptions. Split the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two simple sentences.

The classifier rated the text as B1, which is too complex for the A2 standard. This is an automatic failure.\n\nAnalysis of Deviations:\n- B1 Vocabulary: The text uses the B1 words 'trust', 'lack', and 'democracy'. These are not on the A2 word list and must be replaced or defined in simple terms.\n- B1 Grammar (Relative Clause): The sentence 'Is progress a goal we cannot reach?' uses a relative clause ('we cannot reach') to modify a noun. This is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar (Relative Clause): The sentence 'Enlightenment is a time when people trusted reason and science' uses 'when' to introduce a defining relative clause. This is a B1 structure.\n- B1 Grammar (That-Clause): The sentence 'Some speakers use people\u2019s feeling that nothing will get better' uses a 'that-clause' to explain a noun ('feeling'). This is a B1 structure.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase to improve fidelity. Do not replace specific nouns like 'institutions' with overly generic words like 'parts'. Use 'important groups' or a similar A2-level phrase.\n- Remove all B1 vocabulary. Replace 'lack of trust' with 'when people do not trust others'.\n- Eliminate B1 grammar. Split complex sentences. Rephrase 'Is progress a goal we cannot reach?' to 'Progress is a goal. Can we reach it?'. Rephrase '...feeling that nothing will get better' to 'They use people's bad feelings.

The BERTScore of 0.8592 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text presents an argument with a sense of urgency ('Pinker argues', 'under attack', 'in danger'). Your output reduces this to a list of simple, neutral statements ('Pinker says', 'People attack'), losing the original's persuasive and cautionary tone.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is low because key terms that carry significant meaning were oversimplified. Replacing 'commentators and demagogues', 'tribalism, fatalism and distrust', and 'irreparable damage' resulted in a substantial loss of lexical detail.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 classification was caused by the use of words above the A2 level. The following words are unapproved: 'means' (B2), 'trust' (B1), 'fixed' (B1), 'democracy' (B1).\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary with A2 alternatives. For example, 'democracy' must be explained in simple terms like 'a way for people to choose their leaders'. Rephrase sentences to better capture the original's sense of a strong argument, not just a list of facts. The goal is simplification, not the complete removal of meaning and tone.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6831 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The original's central argument is that an attack on specific values (reason, science) is causing danger to specific institutions (democracy). Your version separates these concepts into disconnected statements, losing the cause-and-effect relationship that forms the core argument.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8501 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical items from the original, such as 'Enlightenment values', 'commentators', 'demagogues', and 'institutions', were replaced with overly generic terms like 'Enlightenment ideas', 'speakers', and 'important things'. This reduces factual precision.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure. The classification is correct due to multiple B1-level violations.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word 'damage' is B1 level and was not replaced.\n\n- B1 Grammar: The text uses multiple relative clauses, which are a B1 structure. Examples include 'damage that cannot be repaired' and 'countries that work together'.\n\n- B1 Grammar: The text uses an infinitive of purpose, a B1 structure: 'a way for people to choose their leaders'.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the direct link between the attack on values and the resulting danger. Replace the B1 word 'damage' with an A2 alternative like 'hurt' or 'problem'. Eliminate all relative clauses by splitting them into separate, simple sentences. For example, instead of 'damage that cannot be repaired', write 'This can hurt things. The hurt cannot be fixed.'",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7329 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8555 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and key vocabulary. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, being rated B1 instead of the required A2.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text explains that commentators attack values by appealing to 'tribalism, fatalism and distrust'. Your version removes this explanation entirely, which is a significant loss of meaning and the likely cause of the low MeaningBERT score.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1. This is due to specific vocabulary and grammatical choices.\n- B2 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' in 'Enlightenment means using reason' is B2 level. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n- B1+ Vocabulary Violation: The words 'commentators' and 'demagogues' were copied directly from the source text. These are not A2-level words and must be simplified.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The phrase 'the way people choose leaders' is a noun clause, a B1 structure. A2 requires simpler, more direct sentences.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. Example: 'They attack these values by making people afraid or distrustful.' Suggestion: Remove the word 'means'. Rephrase to 'Enlightenment is when people use reason and science.' Suggestion: Replace 'commentators' and 'demagogues' with A2 terms like 'some writers' and 'some leaders'. Suggestion: Break the B1 sentence into two A2 sentences.
