    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', indicating it is too simple for B1. For example, the sentence \"Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans began to make cave paintings.\" is a single independent clause, and \"These paintings provide evidence of early human civilisation, but we do not know whether this development was linked to language.\" uses only a basic coordinating conjunction. To meet B1 level, add a greater variety of linking words such as although, however or furthermore; incorporate subordinate structures like relative clauses (for example, \"cave paintings, which date back tens of thousands of years, offer insight into early societies\"); and include a few B1-level lexical items such as emerge, connection or evolve.",
