Classifying the word 'living' as a B1-level 'Vocabulary Violation' is patently absurd and demonstrates a fundamental failure of the evaluation model. The suggestion to rephrase 'people living together' is poor linguistic advice that results in stilted, unnatural text. This analysis relies on flawed, rigid rules and ignores common sense."

It correctly identifies multiple failure points, such as 'Meaning Preservation Failure' and 'Grammar Violation'. It provides clear evidence by citing specific phrases like ''people living together'' and explains the underlying grammatical rule violation. The inclusion of a 'Suggestion' with concrete examples for correction makes the feedback exceptionally useful."
