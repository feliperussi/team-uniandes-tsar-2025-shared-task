By splitting this into two sentences ('...could sometimes set the wooden bridge on fire. This would cause it to burn to the ground.'), the output changes the causal relationship. It implies the fire starting is a possibility, but the burning down is a definite result of that fire, which alters the original's nuance. To correct this, the final idea should be expressed as a single potential outcome, for example: '...sparks... could sometimes cause the wooden bridge to catch fire and burn completely.' Despite this failure, the text is factually accurate and the vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'susceptible' to 'likely') is well-executed.",

This failure is likely because the simplification introduced a cause-and-effect relationship ('so') that was not explicitly stated in the original text. The original text connects two facts with 'and' ('made of wood and were much more susceptible'), whereas the output implies that being made of wood was the direct cause ('built from wood, so they were more likely'). This alters the logical structure of the sentence. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR compliance check, being classified as B2 instead of the target B1. This is due to the second sentence being too long and structurally complex for a B1 level. Suggestion: To correct the meaning, revert the connector from 'so' to 'and'. To meet the B1 requirement, split the long second sentence into two shorter, more direct sentences.",

This is likely because the original phrase 'much more susceptible to fire' was simplified to 'more likely to catch fire', which changes the sense of inherent vulnerability. Additionally, splitting the single event 'catch fire and burn to the ground' into two separate sentences alters the causal structure and emphasis of the original text.
