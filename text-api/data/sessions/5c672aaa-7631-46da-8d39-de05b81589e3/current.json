    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8571 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The simplification of key terms was too aggressive, causing a loss of fidelity. The goal is simplification, not erasure of specific concepts.\n- 'Best-selling author' was replaced with 'popular author'. This loses the specific and important meaning of selling many books.\n- 'Housing estate' was replaced with 'area with many houses'. This loses a specific B1 vocabulary term that could have been retained and explained.\n- 'Writing conferences' was replaced with 'writing meetings'. This loses the specific meaning of a large, formal event.\n- The nuance of 'Luckily, she only used her knowledge' was completely lost in the simplification 'She wrote about this knowledge'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key lexical items from the original text while maintaining simple A2 sentence structures. The text must be simplified without losing this degree of factual detail. For example, retain 'best-selling' and 'housing estate' as they are central to the original's meaning.",

She learned to stay quiet and to stay out of trouble. She also learned to open car doors with a knife. She only used this skill for her books. Now she is not quiet.
