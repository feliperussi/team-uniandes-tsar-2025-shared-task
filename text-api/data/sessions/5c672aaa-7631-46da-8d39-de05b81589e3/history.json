This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1/B2 compound noun 'housing estate' was used directly in the text. This is too complex for the A2 level and is the primary cause of the B1 classification. This term must be simplified into an A2-level description.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'olive' is B1 and was used in the text. While defined, its inclusion contributes to the higher complexity level.\n- Fidelity Loss: Replacing words like 'knowledge' with 'skill' and 'novels' with 'books' contributed to the low BERTScore. While 'novels' is B1, the cumulative effect of these small changes reduced the text's fidelity to the source.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'housing estate' with a simple A2 description, such as 'a part of the city with many homes'. Re-evaluate all B1/B2 vocabulary and ensure it is either replaced or simplified. The text must be rewritten to achieve an A2 classification and a BERTScore of 0.90 or higher.",
