    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6532 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is an instant failure. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8813, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.6532): The output breaks the original text into a series of disconnected statements. This destroys the logical connections. For example, the original states passengers are so used to the dogs THAT they go unnoticed. Your version, 'Now people often see dogs on the trains. Locals often do not notice the dogs,' presents two separate facts and loses this cause-and-effect meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8813): Key information was omitted. The original states dogs travel 'from one part of their territory to another'. Your version, 'They move from one part of their area,' completely removes the destination ('to another'), which is a critical part of the sentence's meaning.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is excessively choppy. While A2 requires simple sentences, this output is a list of simple facts, not a coherent paragraph. The flow is unnatural and fails to connect ideas.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to restore logical flow. Ensure that the full meaning of a phrase, such as moving from a start point 'to' an end point, is preserved. Rewrite to connect cause and effect. Example: 'People are used to the dogs, so they do not notice them.'",
