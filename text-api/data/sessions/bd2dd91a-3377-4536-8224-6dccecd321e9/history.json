The text was oversimplified to the point of losing the original message's nuance and factual detail.\n\n- Primary Failure (Metrics): Your text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score (0.5973) and BERTScore (0.8843) are both too low. This happened because you replaced specific concepts with overly simple phrases. For example, 'humans are more likely to give food' became 'people give food', which loses the key idea of probability. 'travel largely unnoticed' became 'do not notice them', which is an inaccurate absolute statement.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 word 'cute'. It also uses the B1 structure 'are used to'. These are not A2 compliant.\n- Structural Degradation: The sentences are excessively short and disconnected. The sequence 'They use the train to go. They go from one area to another.' is grammatically correct but stylistically poor and unnatural for A2. It demonstrates a failure to use basic conjunctions.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning by using more precise A2 vocabulary. Combine the excessively short sentences. Replace 'cute' with an A2 alternative like 'nice'. Rephrase 'are used to the dogs' to something like 'think the dogs on the train are normal'.",

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship: 'humans are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs SO those dogs are sent to beg'. Your version breaks this into two disconnected statements: 'People give food to small nice dogs. The pack sends those dogs to beg for food.' The removal of the logical connector 'so' destroys the core meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8895 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a result of over-simplification. Key concepts like 'more likely' and 'largely unnoticed' were completely removed, not simplified. This damages the fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The output is a list of choppy, disconnected sentences. While simplicity is required for A2, your text has been simplified to the point of losing coherence. The logical flow between ideas has been eliminated.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the meaning by re-introducing simple A2 connectors. Combine the first three sentences to re-establish the cause-and-effect logic. Rephrase the final sentences to include the concept of people being 'used to' the dogs, which is why they are 'unnoticed'.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and logical structure.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6104 is unacceptable. The original text presents a coherent narrative with cause-and-effect relationships. Your output fragments this into a list of disconnected, simple statements, destroying the logical flow. For example, the original's 'so those dogs are sent to beg' is lost.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8849 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a secondary failure caused by replacing specific terms like 'metro system' and 'territory' with overly generic words like 'train system' and 'area', losing lexical precision.\n- Excessive Fragmentation: The text is broken down too far. Sentences like 'They ride the train to travel' and 'They travel from one part of their area to another' are redundant and should be a single, efficient sentence. This fragmentation is the direct cause of the low meaning score.\n- Redundancy: The first two sentences ('People give food to small nice dogs' and 'Humans are more likely to give food to small nice dogs') are repetitive and inefficient.\n\nSuggestion: Do not mistake simplification for fragmentation. Recombine sentences to restore the logical connections present in the original text. Use simple A2 connectors like 'so' and 'because' to show relationships between ideas. A single, clear A2 sentence is superior to three disconnected A1 sentences that fail to convey the full meaning.",

It was not replaced with an A2 equivalent.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The phrase 'have become used to' is a B1 structure. A2 requires simpler phrasing.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The text uses multiple 'that-clauses' (e.g., 'They learned that...', 'One idea is that...'). These subordinate clauses are a B1-level feature.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure: The sentence 'Scientists do not know how dogs know when to get off' uses a 'wh-clause' ('how dogs know...'), which is a B1 structure.\n- Advanced Vocabulary: The word 'unnoticed' is too complex for A2. The passive form is not appropriate.\n\nSuggestion: Eliminate all subordinate clauses by splitting sentences. Replace 'cute' with an A2 word like 'nice'. Rephrase 'become used to' with a simple description like 'Now, it is normal for people to see dogs'. Replace 'unnoticed' with a simple active phrase like 'locals do not see them'.",

The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8813, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.6532): The output breaks the original text into a series of disconnected statements. This destroys the logical connections. For example, the original states passengers are so used to the dogs THAT they go unnoticed. Your version, 'Now people often see dogs on the trains. Locals often do not notice the dogs,' presents two separate facts and loses this cause-and-effect meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.8813): Key information was omitted. The original states dogs travel 'from one part of their territory to another'. Your version, 'They move from one part of their area,' completely removes the destination ('to another'), which is a critical part of the sentence's meaning.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is excessively choppy. While A2 requires simple sentences, this output is a list of simple facts, not a coherent paragraph. The flow is unnatural and fails to connect ideas.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to restore logical flow. Ensure that the full meaning of a phrase, such as moving from a start point 'to' an end point, is preserved. Rewrite to connect cause and effect.
