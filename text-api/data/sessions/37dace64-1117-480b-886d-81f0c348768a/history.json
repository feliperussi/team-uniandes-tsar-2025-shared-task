This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and nuances of the original text. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  The original text's concise explanation of population growth, 'fuelling rapid population growth. These large families produced even more children who survived into adulthood and had their own children,' is fragmented into multiple simple sentences in your version. This loses the direct causal link and the efficiency of the original's explanation of how population growth occurred.\n2.  The critical concept of 'the global average number of babies per woman has declined from six babies per woman to as low as two' is not fully preserved. Your version states 'Before, a woman had six babies. Now, a woman has only two babies,' which presents two facts but does not explicitly convey the 'average' aspect or the direct 'decline from X to Y' as a single, clear idea.\n3.  While defining 'contraception' is appropriate for A2, the explicit sentence 'Contraception stops a woman from having a baby' adds information not directly present in the original's core message flow, which can contribute to a shift in meaning focus and lower the MeaningBERT score.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the section on population growth to more clearly link the cause (fewer deaths) to the effect (rapid growth) and the mechanism (more children surviving and reproducing). Rephrase the decline section to explicitly state the 'average' and the 'decline from six to two' as a single, coherent concept.",
