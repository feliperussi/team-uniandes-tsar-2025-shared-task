This made the number of people grow very fast. But in the 1960s, many people could get contraception. Contraception is a way to stop having babies. So, around the world, women had fewer babies. The number of babies for each woman went from six to two.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6239 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The original text clearly links 'fewer children died young' to 'fuelling rapid population growth' and details the mechanism through 'These large families produced even more children who survived into adulthood'. Your version fragments these ideas. The strong causal link of 'fuelling' is weakened, and the specific mechanism of 'large families producing even more children who survived into adulthood' is simplified to 'families had many children. These children lived and grew up', losing some of the original's nuanced explanation of population dynamics. Suggestion: Rephrase the section on population growth to more directly convey the causal link and the specific mechanism of 'large families' and 'survived into adulthood' as presented in the original text, while maintaining A2 vocabulary and structure.",
