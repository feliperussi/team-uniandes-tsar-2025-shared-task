The core message was not preserved.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text explains that councils provide areas to 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly'. Your version, 'City leaders want to help artists', completely loses this critical concept of prevention and control. It changes the entire meaning.\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8848 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to replacing specific terms like 'councils' and 'subway trains' with less precise words, losing factual detail.\n- Secondary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is caused by using B1-level vocabulary. The words 'set' and 'zones' are not on the A2 list and are too advanced.\n- Suggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the original meaning about preventing random graffiti. Replace the B1 word 'set' with an A2 verb like 'made'. The keyword 'graffiti zones' must be explained using only A2 words; do not use the B1 word 'zone' in the main text. Use 'special places' or 'special areas' instead.",

The core message has been distorted.\n\n- Factual and Meaning Inaccuracy: The original text states councils 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly' by providing special areas. Your text states 'City leaders want to stop graffiti on any wall.' This is a different meaning. It changes the concept from managing a problem to banning it, which is factually incorrect based on the source.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8799 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'encourage' and 'randomly' were deleted, losing critical information from the original text.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'subway' is B1 level. It was not simplified to an A2 equivalent.\n- Poor Structure: The text is a list of short, disconnected sentences. The flow is unnatural and too simplistic, even for A2. The definition 'Graffiti is paint art on walls' is inserted awkwardly in the middle of the text.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the first sentence to capture the idea of 'encouraging' artists to use specific places. Combine short sentences to create better flow. Replace 'subway trains' with 'city trains'.",
