    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6625 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n*   Primary Failure: The logical connection is broken. The original text explains that councils create designated areas *in order to* stop random graffiti. Your version presents these as two separate facts: 'City leaders ask artists to paint in special places' and 'They want artists not to paint on any wall'. The cause-and-effect relationship is completely lost.\n*   Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8842 is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n*   Suggestion: You must restore the logical link. Rephrase to show cause and effect. Use a simple A2 connector. Example: 'City leaders want to stop artists from painting on any wall, so they give them special places to paint.' This correction restores the original meaning.",
