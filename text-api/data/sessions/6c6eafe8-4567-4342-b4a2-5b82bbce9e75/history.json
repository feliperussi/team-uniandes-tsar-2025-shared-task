The goal is to communicate using words the A2 learner already knows, not to teach new, complex vocabulary. The sentence structure is simple and appropriate, but the vocabulary violation is a critical and non-negotiable error."

The replacement of 'coincidence' (B2) with the A2-level explanation 'chance when two things happen at the same time' is exemplary. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1-A2 range. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are needed."
