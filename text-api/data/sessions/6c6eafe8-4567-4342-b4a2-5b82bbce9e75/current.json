    "text_translated": "Sometimes you dream about a phone call from an old friend. Or you dream that someone close to you dies. This does not mean your dream can see the future. It is probably just chance when two things happen at the same time. And, of course, we probably forget all the times we dream about these things but they do not happen.",

    "feedback": "This is a flawless A2 text. The writer successfully deconstructed complex sentences from the original text into simple, declarative statements. The replacement of 'coincidence' (B2) with the A2-level explanation 'chance when two things happen at the same time' is exemplary. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1-A2 range. Factual accuracy is perfectly maintained. No corrections are needed.",
