While the definition of 'asteroids' is helpful, combining the main action, the definition, and the size specification into one long sentence pushes the complexity beyond B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting this sentence into two or three simpler sentences. For example: 'NASA is now trying to find some smaller asteroids.

The simplification has resulted in a text that is too basic for the target audience. For instance, the original's 'logging some of the smaller asteroids' was simplified to 'trying to find some smaller asteroids' and later 'found and recorded', which, while accurate, reduces the lexical complexity. The explanation 'These are large rocks that travel in space' is a very basic A1/A2 definition for 'asteroids'. Phrases like 'still not found' for 'unaccounted for' and 'hurt' for 'injured' also contribute to the lower CEFR level. The sentence structures, while grammatically correct, are predominantly simple or compound with basic conjunctions, lacking the slightly more complex structures and vocabulary expected at B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider retaining slightly more sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate, or introducing more varied sentence structures, such as more complex clauses or B1-level connectors (e.g., 'however', 'therefore', 'although'). Ensure that while simplifying, the text doesn't lose all its lexical density, which is a key differentiator between A2 and B1.",

The primary reason for this classification is the sustained use of complex sentence structures and advanced cohesive devices. For instance, the sentence 'Scientists estimate there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size; however, so far, only about 8,000 have been identified and recorded, leaving 17,000 unaccounted for.' uses a semicolon, the connector 'however', and a participial phrase ('leaving 17,000 unaccounted for'), which are characteristic of B2 complexity. Similarly, the sentence 'Considering that a 19-metre asteroid that exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 injured 1,200 people, these larger asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.' begins with a complex introductory clause ('Considering that...') and contains a relative clause, making it challenging for a B1 reader. To achieve B1, sentences should generally be shorter and less syntactically dense. Break down complex sentences into two or more simpler ones. For example, the second sentence could be split: 'Scientists estimate there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. However, so far, only about 8,000 have been identified and recorded. This means 17,000 are still unaccounted for.' Also, simplify introductory clauses and reduce the number of clauses per sentence.",

While the vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, the sentence 'A 19-metre asteroid exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 and injured 1,200 people' is too long and dense for a B1 reader. Even though it is a compound sentence, the amount of information packed into a single sentence makes it challenging. To achieve a B1 level, this sentence should be split into two simpler sentences. For example: 'In 2013, a 19-metre asteroid exploded above Chelyabinsk in Russia. It injured 1,200 people.' This would reduce the cognitive load and improve readability for the target audience.",

While the text successfully maintained factual integrity and preserved the core meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9044, BERTScore: 0.958), it did not meet the target CEFR level for simplification. For instance, the sentence 'NASA is now working to identify and record some of the smaller asteroids, which are large rocks that travel in space and are 140 metres or more wide' contains a long and complex relative clause that pushes it beyond B1. Additionally, the participial phrase 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' is a grammatical structure more commonly found at the B2 level. To achieve a B1 level, consider splitting longer sentences into shorter, more manageable units. For example, the first sentence could be split into two: 'NASA is now working to identify and record some of the smaller asteroids. These are large rocks that travel in space and are 140 metres or more wide.' The phrase 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' could be simplified to 'This means 17,000 have not been identified yet' or 'So, 17,000 are still not identified'.",

While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the core meaning, the sentence structures and vocabulary choices consistently lean towards a lower proficiency level. For example, the original's more complex structure 'Considering that a 19-metre asteroid... injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger...' was simplified into very short, direct sentences like 'It hurt 1,200 people. Because of this, these medium-sized asteroids would be a big danger...'. The use of 'big danger' instead of 'serious danger' and 'come into' instead of 'enter' also contributes to the A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider using slightly more varied sentence structures, perhaps combining some of the shorter sentences with B1-level conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'however', 'therefore') or more precise B1 vocabulary where appropriate, while still maintaining clarity.",
