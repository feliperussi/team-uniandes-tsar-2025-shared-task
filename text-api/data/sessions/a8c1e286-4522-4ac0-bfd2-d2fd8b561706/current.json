Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but only about 8,000 have been identified and recorded so far. This means 17,000 have not been identified yet. In 2013, a 19-metre asteroid exploded above Chelyabinsk in Russia. It hurt 1,200 people. Because of this, these medium-sized asteroids would be a big danger if they come into Earth's orbit.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the required 'B1' level. While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the core meaning, the sentence structures and vocabulary choices consistently lean towards a lower proficiency level. For example, the original's more complex structure 'Considering that a 19-metre asteroid... injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger...' was simplified into very short, direct sentences like 'It hurt 1,200 people. Because of this, these medium-sized asteroids would be a big danger...'. The use of 'big danger' instead of 'serious danger' and 'come into' instead of 'enter' also contributes to the A2 classification. To achieve a B1 level, consider using slightly more varied sentence structures, perhaps combining some of the shorter sentences with B1-level conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'however', 'therefore') or more precise B1 vocabulary where appropriate, while still maintaining clarity.",
