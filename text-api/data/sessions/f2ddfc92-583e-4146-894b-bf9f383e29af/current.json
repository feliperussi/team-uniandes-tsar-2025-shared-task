Both MeaningBERT (0.7655) and BERTScore (0.9215) are above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and key terms. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. A qualitative audit confirms the text's suitability. Vocabulary is restricted to the A2 level, with the B1 key term 'feedback sandwich' being appropriately defined in simple terms. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic A2 connectors like 'and' and 'but'. No deviations from the A2 standard were detected.",
