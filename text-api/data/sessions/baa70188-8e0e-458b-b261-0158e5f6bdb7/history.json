        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple for the target B1 level. While the simplification maintains factual integrity and meaning, the linguistic choices consistently reduce the complexity below the B1 threshold. For example, 'freezing conditions' was simplified to 'very cold weather', 'violent storms' to 'strong storms', and 'extremely dangerous' to 'very dangerous'. These vocabulary choices, while correct, lean heavily towards A2. Similarly, phrases like 'look for new challenges' became 'want to find new challenges', and 'fell in love with' became 'started to love'. To achieve a B1 level, the text should aim for a slightly more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure, while still remaining accessible. Consider retaining some of the original B1-level vocabulary where appropriate, or introducing B1-level synonyms. Also, explore a slightly wider range of B1 grammatical structures, such as more varied subordinate clauses, to elevate the text from A2 to B1.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9995 are both exceptionally high, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. The only change made was replacing 'Though' with 'Although'. This is a minor but appropriate simplification, as 'Although' is a common B1-level connector. The original text was already quite accessible, which explains the minimal changes required. For future tasks, if the source text is already at the target CEFR level, consider if there are opportunities to enhance clarity, sentence structure variety, or address any subtle complexities that might not be flagged by basic vocabulary lists, while strictly maintaining the B1 level.",
