    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9995 are both exceptionally high, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. The only change made was replacing 'Though' with 'Although'. This is a minor but appropriate simplification, as 'Although' is a common B1-level connector. The original text was already quite accessible, which explains the minimal changes required. For future tasks, if the source text is already at the target CEFR level, consider if there are opportunities to enhance clarity, sentence structure variety, or address any subtle complexities that might not be flagged by basic vocabulary lists, while strictly maintaining the B1 level.",
