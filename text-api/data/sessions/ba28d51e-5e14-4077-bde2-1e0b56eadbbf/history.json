The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8987, which is below the required 0.90.\n\n- The primary failure is a loss of the original text's core message about the subject's high status and prestige.\n- The phrase 'leading researcher' was simplified to 'important researcher', which loses the meaning of being at the forefront of a field.\n- The original text specifies that her papers were in 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals'. Your version, 'She wrote more than 50 papers', completely removes the critical concept of quality and academic prestige. This is a major contributor to the low MeaningBERT score.\n- The 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was reduced to 'a very important prize'. This simplification loses too much specific information and contributes to the low BERTScore.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification process must preserve the core concepts of the original. Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. For the papers, a phrase like 'Her papers are in very good science books' would better capture the idea of quality. For her status, use 'She is one of the best researchers'. The text must convey not just what she did, but the high level at which she did it.",

The text fails because it includes words that are above the A2 level without simplification or explanation.\n\nViolation: The word 'academy' is a C1 level word. The word 'royal' is a B1 level word.\nEvidence: These words are used in the sentence 'In 2012, she won the Royal Academy Simone Fielding prize.'\nAnalysis: A strict A2 text cannot contain B1 or C1 vocabulary, even within a proper name. The purpose of the text is readability for an A2 learner, who would not know these words. You made no attempt to simplify this concept.\nSuggestion: Rephrase to remove or explain the difficult words. For example: 'In 2012, she won an important prize from a group called the Royal Academy.' This removes the C1 word. A better option would be: 'In 2012, she won a prize from the Royal Academy. The academy is a special group for important scientists.'",
