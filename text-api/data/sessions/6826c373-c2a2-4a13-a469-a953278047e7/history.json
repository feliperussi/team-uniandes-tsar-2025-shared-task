        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7024 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This failure is likely caused by a significant change in the final sentence. The original text asks a direct question: 'Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest?'. The output changes this into a statement of possibilities: 'People may see them as welcome guests, or they may view them as a danger or a pest.' This alters the core meaning and rhetorical intent from an open inquiry to a declarative statement. To correct this, the simplified text should retain the question format, for example: 'Are people happy to see them, or do they think the animals are a danger or a pest?'. On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, meets the B1 CEFR target, and uses appropriate vocabulary simplification.",

        "feedback_text": "Excellent work. This submission passes all checks and serves as a model for B1 simplification. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all key details like animal types and locations preserved. The MeaningBERT (0.81) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key phrasing were successfully retained. The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The vocabulary choices are particularly effective. Replacing 'world's press' with 'news media' and 'coming into cities' with 'entering urban areas' are precise and level-appropriate substitutions. The rephrasing of 'Are they welcome' to 'Are people happy to see them' is a great example of simplifying a concept rather than just a word, which enhances clarity for the B1 reader. The final text is fluent, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the B1 requirements.",
