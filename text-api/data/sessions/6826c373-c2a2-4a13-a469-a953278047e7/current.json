However, the news media have recently reported many more wild animals entering urban areas. For example, bears have appeared in Vancouver parks, leopards on the streets of Mumbai, and wild pigs in Berlin gardens. When larger animals move into our cities, what usually happens?

    "feedback": "Excellent work. This submission passes all checks and serves as a model for B1 simplification. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all key details like animal types and locations preserved. The MeaningBERT (0.81) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key phrasing were successfully retained. The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The vocabulary choices are particularly effective. Replacing 'world's press' with 'news media' and 'coming into cities' with 'entering urban areas' are precise and level-appropriate substitutions. The rephrasing of 'Are they welcome' to 'Are people happy to see them' is a great example of simplifying a concept rather than just a word, which enhances clarity for the B1 reader. The final text is fluent, accurate, and perfectly aligned with the B1 requirements.",
