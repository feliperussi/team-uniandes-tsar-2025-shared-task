The sentences \"Gary Collins is a policeman who was off duty\" and \"...software that finds faces identified only one person\" must be simplified.\n\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses words that are not on the A2 list. 'essential' is a B1 word. 'investigation' is a B2 word. This is unacceptable.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove all relative clauses. Split complex sentences into two simple sentences. Example: \"Gary Collins is a policeman. He was off duty.\" Replace B1/B2 vocabulary immediately. Replace 'essential' with 'very important'. Replace 'investigation' with a simple phrase like 'the police work'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8953 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text due to oversimplification.\n\n- The phrase 'decisive importance in the investigation' was reduced to 'very important. It helped the police work.' This simplification loses the specific and important nouns 'importance' and 'investigation'.\n- The term 'facial recognition software' was replaced with 'The software'. This removes critical descriptive information and lowers lexical fidelity.\n- The original text states Gary Collins 'managed to identify' people, which implies effort. Your version 'He identified' loses this nuance.\n- The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure contributes to the low fidelity score and reads at an A1 level of simplicity, even if the vocabulary is A2.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key nouns like 'investigation' and 'facial recognition'. Combine some of the very short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'but' to improve flow and better match the original text's structure. For example: 'He spent six months looking at CCTV video and he identified 190 people.'",
