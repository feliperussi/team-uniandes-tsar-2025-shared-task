    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is above the required A2 level. This is an instant failure.\n\n- Violation: The sentence 'His help was of decisive importance in the investigation' is copied directly from the original text. This phrase is too complex for A2. It contains the words 'decisive' (C1), 'importance' (B1), and 'investigation' (B2).\n- Violation: The phrase 'Facial recognition software' uses the B2 word 'recognition'.\n- Violation: The phrase 'off duty' uses the B1 word 'duty'.\n\nSuggestion: You must simplify all vocabulary to the A2 level. Rephrase 'His help was of decisive importance in the investigation' to 'His help was very important for the police'. Rephrase 'off duty' to 'he was not working'. Rephrase 'Facial recognition software' to 'The face software'.",
