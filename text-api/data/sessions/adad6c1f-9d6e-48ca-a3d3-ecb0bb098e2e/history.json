The original text begins by discussing research questions about genetics. Your output adds a three-sentence introductory paragraph defining the word 'gene'. This new information is not present in the source text and fundamentally alters the core message, causing the meaning preservation metric to fail. The task is to simplify the provided text, not to add external definitions or introductory content.\n\n- Deviation: Addition of non-source material. The paragraph 'A gene is a small part of your body. It comes from your parents. Genes tell your body how to grow and work.' is entirely new content.\n- Deviation: The BERTScore of 0.9048 is barely passing. The addition of new content diluted the fidelity to the original's key phrases.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the entire first paragraph. The simplified text must begin by directly addressing the questions scientists are asking, as in the original text. Do not add information that is not in the source.",

The text fails because it uses a B2-level word without providing the required A2-level definition.\n\n- Vocabulary Failure: The word 'gene' is classified as B2 level. It is used multiple times without an in-text definition. An A2 reader cannot be expected to understand this core concept, making the text inaccessible. The keyword was identified for definition but the definition was not provided in the output.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Borderline: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7489 is at the absolute minimum threshold of 0.75. This indicates a slight loss of meaning, likely from simplifying 'gene mutation' to just 'gene... changed' without explaining the core concept.\n\nSuggestion: The word 'gene' must be defined in simple A2 terms at its first use. Example: 'Genes are special parts in our body. They decide things like our eye color.' After this definition, the word can be used. Alternatively, rephrase the entire text to avoid the technical term.",

The core message and key lexical items have been successfully preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier result of 'A2' is correct and has been verified through qualitative analysis.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates exemplary adherence to A2 standards. Vocabulary is strictly controlled. The single B2-level keyword 'gene' was correctly identified as essential and was defined in simple, A2-appropriate terms directly within the text. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, utilizing only basic connectors ('and', 'but'). The output is a model of successful A2 simplification.",
