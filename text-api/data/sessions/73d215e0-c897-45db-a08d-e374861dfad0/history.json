The MeaningBERT score of 0.63 is far below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.87 is also below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains a system where 'underutilised assets' are used to 'generate profit'. Your text reduces this concept to 'sharing old things'. This is a gross oversimplification that loses the core economic meaning. An item that is not used much is not necessarily old.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key vocabulary. Words like 'underutilised', 'asset', 'generate profit', and 'peer-to-peer' were deleted, stripping the text of its essential details.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is a series of disconnected, simplistic sentences. For example, 'Online groups have found a way.' is a meaningless sentence on its own. This disjointed structure contributes to the overall failure to convey the original message.\n\n- Keyword Failure: The B1 term 'sharing economy' was used but not adequately defined. Your definition, 'when people share old things', is factually incomplete and misleading.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Restore the original meaning by replacing 'old things' with a phrase like 'things people do not use often'. Combine the short sentences to create a logical flow. For example, 'Online groups found a way to make money by helping people share things they do not use often.' You must accurately represent the concepts from the original text.",

You must explain what it means using only A2 words.\n- Logical Flow: The sentences are too short and disconnected. The original text explains a process. Your text is a list of statements that do not connect logically.

This loses the essential meaning of a 'sharing' economy.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8471 is below the 0.90 threshold. Key terms from the original text such as 'asset', 'peer-to-peer', and the official term 'sharing economy' were completely removed instead of being simplified. This results in a loss of factual detail.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' is B2 level. It must be removed. An A2 text cannot contain B2 vocabulary.\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The keyword 'sharing economy' was not defined. It was replaced with 'sharing system' and then poorly explained. A simple definition was required.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to focus on the idea of people sharing things they do not use often, not just selling old things. Restore the term 'sharing economy' and define it simply. For example: 'The sharing economy is when people make money by sharing things they own.' Remove the word 'means'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8545 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and key vocabulary.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains that underused items can be an 'asset' and that online communities 'generate profit'. Your version simplifies this to 'earn money', which is a weaker concept and loses the important idea of an item's inherent value.\n\n- Factual Simplification: The original specifies 'buying and selling of second-hand goods' as a key activity. Your text only mentions 'sharing', which is an incomplete and misleading representation of the sharing economy.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms from the original text such as 'asset', 'underutilised', and 'peer-to-peer' were completely removed, not simplified. This directly caused the low BERTScore.\n\n- Keyword Handling: The B1 term 'economy' was used twice. The definition provided ('when people make money... by sharing things they own') is too simplistic and omits the crucial role of the internet and online communities mentioned in the original text.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to restore the lost meaning. Reintroduce the concept that one person's unused item is valuable to another. Specify that activities include buying, selling, and renting. Define 'sharing economy' by explaining that the internet helps normal people do these things with each other.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8616 is below the 0.90 minimum, showing a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- The text loses the direct link between sharing underused items and generating profit. The original's core idea is to 'generate profit from the sharing of those underused assets.' Your version separates these ideas into disjointed sentences, weakening the central concept.\n- Vocabulary is not A2 compliant. The words 'fee' (B1), 'trade' (B1), and 'trading' (B2) are above the required A2 level and must be removed.\n- The definition for the keyword 'sharing economy' is circular and inadequate. The sentences 'This is called the sharing economy. The sharing economy is when the internet helps people' do not explain the concept clearly.\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to directly connect making money with letting others use your items. Replace all B1 and B2 vocabulary with A2 alternatives. Provide a clear, simple definition for 'sharing economy', such as: 'This is the sharing economy. It is when people use the internet to share things they own and make money from them.'",
