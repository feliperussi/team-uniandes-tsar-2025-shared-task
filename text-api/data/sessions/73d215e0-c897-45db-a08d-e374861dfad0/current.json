    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6058 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8512 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.\n- The original text explains a concept: how online communities create a system for turning unused items ('assets') into profit. Your version reduces this to a list of simple, disconnected actions, losing the causal link.\n- The text is highly repetitive. The sentences 'People can let others use their items for money' and 'They can make money by letting others use things they own' say the same thing and must be consolidated.\n- Key concepts like 'underutilised items', 'asset', and 'peer-to-peer' were completely removed, not simplified. This damages the meaning.\n- The definition provided, 'The sharing economy is when people use the internet', is factually weak. The internet is the tool, not the definition of the economy.\n- Suggestion: Re-write to explain the system. Start with the idea that some people have things they do not use. Explain that these things can be useful to other people. Then, state that the internet helps these people connect to share items for money. Remove the repetitive sentences.",
