    "text_translated": "It is helpful to understand that expectations and behaviour can be different. This helps us avoid communication problems. However, it is very important to remember that cultural **stereotypes** can be bad for building good business relationships. **Stereotypes are fixed and often unfair ideas about a group of people.** National cultures can play a part in how we behave and think, but we are also influenced by many other things. These include the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age and gender, our company culture, and our own personal experiences. For this reason, we should keep this knowledge of possible differences in mind. But we should not use it to think that everyone from a particular nation is the same.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text is clear, coherent, and well-structured, using a good mix of simple and more complex sentences connected by appropriate linkers like 'However' and 'For this reason'. The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level, and you correctly identified and defined the key term 'stereotypes' in simple language. All key information from the original text has been accurately preserved without adding any personal opinions.",
