    "feedback": "PASS: This text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers, and names from the original text are preserved with perfect accuracy.\n- Metric Compliance: The text exceeds all metric requirements. The MeaningBERT score of 0.85 and BERTScore of 0.91 confirm that the core message and key details were successfully retained. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the output as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'poisonous' to the descriptive phrase 'that can kill you' is an excellent A2 strategy.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's longer sentences have been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences. This structure is ideal for A2 readability. The text demonstrates a complete and successful adherence to all A2 standards.",
