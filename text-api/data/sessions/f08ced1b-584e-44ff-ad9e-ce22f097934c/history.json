        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text uses B1 vocabulary: 'punish' and 'battle'. These words are not A2 level and must be replaced. The text is also factually inaccurate due to omission. The original text states the children are chosen 'by lottery', but your output omits this crucial detail. The sentence structure is simple, but the vocabulary and factual errors make this a clear failure."

        "feedback_text": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. Complex concepts like 'punished for rebelling' are expertly rephrased into A2-level language ('show people what happens when they break the rules'). The writer correctly breaks down long, complex sentences from the original into short, simple declarative sentences. The strategy of introducing a necessary but higher-level word ('lottery') and immediately defining it with a simple phrase ('so it is by chance') is exemplary for this level. All vocabulary and grammatical structures are perfectly aligned with the A2 standard."
