    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to show people what happens when they break the rules. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area. They choose them by lottery, so it is by chance. The children are 12 to 18 years old. These chosen children are called 'tributes'. The tributes must fight until only one person is alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. Complex concepts like 'punished for rebelling' are expertly rephrased into A2-level language ('show people what happens when they break the rules'). The writer correctly breaks down long, complex sentences from the original into short, simple declarative sentences. The strategy of introducing a necessary but higher-level word ('lottery') and immediately defining it with a simple phrase ('so it is by chance') is exemplary for this level. All vocabulary and grammatical structures are perfectly aligned with the A2 standard.",
