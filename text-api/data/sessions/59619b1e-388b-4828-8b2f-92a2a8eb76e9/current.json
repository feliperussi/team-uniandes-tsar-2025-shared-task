    "feedback": "This is an exemplary B1 simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.845) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieves the B1 CEFR target. The qualitative analysis is outstanding: the writer successfully broke down complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones while maintaining a logical flow with appropriate connectors like 'However' and 'For this reason'. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of good practice; the provided definition is clear, concise, and seamlessly integrated into the text. Vocabulary replacement was also excellent, with complex terms like 'detrimental' and 'pigeonhole' being replaced with accessible B1-level equivalents ('harmful' and 'judge...in the same way'). No improvements are necessary.",
