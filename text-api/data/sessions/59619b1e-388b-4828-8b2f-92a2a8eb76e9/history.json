The text passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, but it failed the primary requirement of meeting the B1 CEFR level. The classifier rated the output as 'B2'. The diagnosis points to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'However, it is also very important to remember that using stereotypes, which are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like, can be harmful to building good business relationships' contains multiple clauses, including a non-defining relative clause, which is a feature of B2-level text. To correct this, the sentence should be split into two simpler sentences. Additionally, the use of the passive voice in 'we are also mainly shaped by' increases the complexity and should be rephrased for a B1 audience.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6872 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a significant shift in the text's core message or nuance. The primary issue likely stems from the simplification of key concepts. The original phrase 'something we keep at the back of our minds' implies a subtle, background awareness. Simplifying this to 'remember our knowledge... as general information' is more direct but loses this specific nuance. This change, combined with simplifying the strong verb 'pigeonhole' to 'label', has altered the semantic meaning enough to fail the check. Suggestion: To improve the score while maintaining B1 level, try to rephrase to better capture the original nuance, for example: 'we should keep these possible differences in mind, but not use them to judge everyone from a country in the same way'.",

The MeaningBERT (0.845) and BERTScore (0.92) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The text correctly achieves the B1 CEFR target. The qualitative analysis is outstanding: the writer successfully broke down complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones while maintaining a logical flow with appropriate connectors like 'However' and 'For this reason'. The handling of the keyword 'stereotypes' is a model of good practice; the provided definition is clear, concise, and seamlessly integrated into the text. Vocabulary replacement was also excellent, with complex terms like 'detrimental' and 'pigeonhole' being replaced with accessible B1-level equivalents ('harmful' and 'judge...in the same way'). No improvements are necessary.",
