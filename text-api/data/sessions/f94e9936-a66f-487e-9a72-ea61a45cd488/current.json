    "text_translated": "For the last ten years, people were angry with big supermarkets. People said they did many bad things. They threw away a lot of food. They did not pay enough money to the people who give them food. They also used too much plastic for their food bags and boxes. This was bad for our environment. But now, supermarkets are starting to listen. People are very angry about all the plastic rubbish. Because of this, some of the biggest supermarkets in the UK made a promise. They promise to change their food boxes and bags and use less plastic.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. It maintains perfect factual accuracy while simplifying complex concepts ('come under fire' -> 'people were angry'; 'unethical acts' -> 'bad things'). Sentence structure is simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly within the A1/A2 range, with excellent substitutions like 'rubbish' for 'waste'. No corrections are necessary.",
