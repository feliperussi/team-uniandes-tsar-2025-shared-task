In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons, which are a type of large monkey, have started coming into residential areas on the edge of the city to feed. They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards; in fact, some brave baboons have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges. Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.9826) significantly exceeded the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating successful adherence to the target complexity level. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'baboons' by adding 'which are a type of large monkey', which is a crucial simplification strategy for B1 learners. The use of 'frequently' as a replacement for 'often' is appropriate. The connection of two sentences using a semicolon and the B1 connector 'in fact' ('They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and orchards; in fact, some brave baboons have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges') is a good example of B1 sentence structuring. The overall flow is natural, and the vocabulary is well-suited for the B1 level, even with the retention of some B2/C1 words like 'presence' and 'residential', as the context and surrounding language make them accessible. This is a very strong simplification.",
