The MeaningBERT score of 0.6491 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message's core. The primary focus of the original text is the two contrasting ideas about dreams, not biographical details about Freud. Your introduction shifts this focus.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Factual Inaccuracy: The sentences 'Freud was a famous doctor. He studied people's minds.' are not present in the original text. The original only mentions Freud's belief regarding dreams, not his profession or general field of study. Adding this information is a factual deviation from the source material.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6491 is too low. The addition of biographical details about Freud at the beginning dilutes the original text's core message, which is to present and contrast two main ideas about dreams. The original text introduces Freud only in the context of one of these ideas, not as a general figure.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Remove the sentences 'Freud was a famous doctor. He studied people's minds.' as they are not in the original text and introduce extraneous information.\n- Ensure the summary immediately focuses on the two main ideas about dreams, as this is the central theme of the original text, to improve meaning preservation.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6705 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.916 is acceptable, but fidelity alone is insufficient without meaning preservation. Specific deviations are detailed below. \n\n- The core contrast between the two theories is weakened. The original states, 'However, the other theory was the opposite.' Your version uses 'But the other idea was different,' which does not convey the strong opposition central to the original text. \n- The concept of 'random activity' in the second theory is lost. The original states, 'dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain.' Your version simplifies this to 'dreams are just many mixed-up things,' which diminishes the specific nature of the brain's activity described. \n- The depth of the first theory is slightly reduced. The original 'represent things hidden from our conscious mind' is simplified to 'Dreams show us secret things. These things are in our brain. We do not know them when we are awake.' While simpler, it loses some of the precise meaning of 'represent' and 'conscious mind.' \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to explicitly state the second theory is the 'opposite' of the first. Ensure the concept of 'random activity' is clearly conveyed, perhaps using 'things that happen by chance' or 'things that are not planned.' Restore the idea that dreams 'show' or 'are like' things that are 'hidden' from our 'waking mind' to better capture the Freudian concept.",
