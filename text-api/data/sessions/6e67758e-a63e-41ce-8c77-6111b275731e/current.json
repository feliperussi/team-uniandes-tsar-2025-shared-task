Freud was a famous doctor. He thought this: If we know what dreams mean, we can know our feelings. These are feelings inside us. We can also know our problems.\n\nBut the other idea was the opposite. It said dreams are just mixed up things in our brain. Our brain does this when it puts memories from the day in order. When we wake up, we try to understand these mixed up pictures and feelings. We try to make them into a story.",

    "grade": 10,
    "feedback": "PASS: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to the CEFR A2 readability standard. All diagnostic checks were passed without deviation. The factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning is preserved, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7906 and a BERTScore of 0.9193. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is consistently at an A1/A2 level, with complex terms from the original text simplified effectively (e.g., '18th and 19th centuries' to '200 years ago', 'represent' to 'show', 'hidden from our conscious mind' to 'do not know'). Sentence structures are short and simple, using A1/A2 connectors such as 'and', 'but', 'if', and 'when'. The contextualization of 'Freud' as 'a famous doctor' is an appropriate A2-level definition for a proper noun. No B1 or higher vocabulary or grammatical structures were detected.",
