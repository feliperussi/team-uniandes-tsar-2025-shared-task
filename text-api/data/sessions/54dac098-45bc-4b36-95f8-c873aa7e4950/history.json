This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The phrase 'educate the public about conservation issues' was oversimplified to 'teach people about keeping animals safe'. This loses the important A2 concept of 'conservation' and reduces a broad educational goal to a simple action.\n- The original text's concept of 'inspire people' was completely removed. Your version states the outcome ('makes people want to protect animals') but omits the cause ('inspiration'), which is a key part of the original meaning.\n- While the sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2, the simplification of vocabulary and concepts was too aggressive, resulting in a text that does not convey the same meaning as the source.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to include the educational aspect more accurately. A better alternative would be: 'They can teach people why it is important to protect animals and nature.' This is still A2 level but is much closer to the original meaning of 'conservation issues'.",

The original text describes the potential and function of zoos, using phrases like 'have the potential to educate' and 'carry out important research'.

This simplification loses the essential meaning about the role and purpose of zoos in conservation and science. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are appropriate for A2, the loss of the core message is an immediate failure. Suggestion: Revise the text to reflect the original's focus on purpose and potential. Use phrases like 'Zoos can teach people' instead of 'They teach people'.

This loses the broader educational context about environmental problems and solutions.\n- Structural Deviation: The text is excessively fragmented. Breaking single complex ideas into multiple, very short sentences has destroyed the logical connections between concepts, further contributing to the low meaning preservation score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the concept of 'important research'.

The meaning is not equivalent.\n- The term 'abandoned' was weakened to 'left alone'. 'Abandoned' implies a permanent and negative action, which is lost in the new phrasing.\n\nSuggestion: The core concepts must be preserved, even if simplified. Restore the meaning of 'conservation'. A phrase like 'how to protect nature' or 'saving animals' would be more accurate than 'problems for animals'. Use stronger A2 words to reflect the original meaning of 'mistreated' and 'abandoned'.",
