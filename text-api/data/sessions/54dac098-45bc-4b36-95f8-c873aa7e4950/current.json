    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6312 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for the low score is the oversimplification of key concepts. The original phrase 'educate the public about conservation issues' implies a broad educational mission. Your version, 'teach people why it is important to protect animals,' is too narrow and loses this wider meaning.\n\n- The original text's concept of 'inspire people' is an active, motivational idea. Your version, 'This can make people want to help,' is passive and weak, failing to capture the intended impact.\n\n- While the BERTScore is acceptable, it only shows that you used similar words. The MeaningBERT failure shows that the combination of those words did not successfully convey the original intent.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to better capture the concept of 'conservation issues'. A phrase like 'teach people about saving nature' is more accurate. The concept of 'inspire' must be made stronger.",
