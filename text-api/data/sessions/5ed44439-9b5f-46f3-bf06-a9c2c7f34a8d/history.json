This is likely due to the use of grammatical structures that are too advanced for B1, specifically the passive voice in the sentence 'Some asteroids are considered dangerous...'. While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well, this grammatical complexity makes it unsuitable for the target audience. Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence using the active voice to reduce complexity, for example: 'Some asteroids are dangerous because they can pass very close to Earth.'

While the text is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning, its linguistic complexity is too high. The likely cause is the combination of complex sentence structures and a high density of B1 vocabulary. For example, the sentence 'This happens when an asteroid passes within 7.5 million kilometres of our planet's orbit' uses a subordinate clause and a long prepositional phrase. Additionally, the frequent use of B1 words like 'impact', 'launch', 'defence', and 'threat' in a short text elevates the overall difficulty. Suggestion: To achieve a B1 level, break down complex sentences. For instance, rephrase the example sentence to: 'This happens when an asteroid passes close to our planet. It must be within 7.5 million kilometres of our orbit.'",

While the text successfully maintained factual accuracy and preserved the original meaning (as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores), its sentence structure likely caused the incorrect classification. The sentence 'However, it does not expect any of them to be a danger in the next one hundred years' is 19 words long and structurally more complex than typical B1 sentences. To correct this, split the long sentence into two shorter ones. For example: 'However, NASA does not expect this to be a problem. They believe Earth will be safe for the next 100 years.' This adjustment would reduce the average sentence length and help the text meet the B1 target. The definition of the keyword 'Asteroids' was handled well.",
