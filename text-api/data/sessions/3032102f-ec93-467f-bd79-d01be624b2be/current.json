This is usually where something is hiding, or where a bad `psychopath` has put their tools. A `psychopath` is a person with a serious mental illness that makes them act in a violent or dangerous way. Basements are always dark and often wet, and you can only get to them by a small staircase. Also, they are always creepy, even when nothing is there.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8296) and BERTScore (0.9369) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. The definition for the keyword 'psychopath' is clear, accurate, and appropriately placed. Vocabulary simplifications, such as 'evil' to 'bad', 'damp' to 'wet', 'hidden' to 'put', and 'narrow' to 'small', are effective and maintain the original meaning while reducing complexity. The sentence structure is varied and uses B1-appropriate connectors, ensuring good flow and readability. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
