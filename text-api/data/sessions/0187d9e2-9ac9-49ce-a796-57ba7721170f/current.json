When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was the tale of Theseus and the Minotaur. In that story the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians fight back. As punishment, King Minos of Crete forces the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete each year. The youths are put into a labyrinth where the Minotaur lives and eats them. One of the youths, Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that successfully passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.97) metrics confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary choices are particularly effective. For example, simplifying 'rebel' to the phrasal verb 'fight back' is a great B1-level strategy. Similarly, rephrasing 'eaten by a monster that lives there' to 'where the Minotaur lives and eats them' improves clarity and flow without losing essential information. All keywords were correctly retained. This submission serves as a strong example of effective text simplification.",
