Additionally, the text fails on CEFR compliance, receiving a B2 classification instead of the target B1. This is likely caused by overly complex sentence structures, such as 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games, a series of books about a deadly competition, comes from...'. To fix this, split long sentences into shorter, more direct ones. For example: 'An important inspiration for the Hunger Games comes from Suzanne Collins\u2019 love of ancient Greek mythology.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6482 is well below the required 0.75 threshold. This is because new information, not present in the original text, was introduced (e.g., 'The Hunger Games is a series of books about a deadly competition.'). While this context might be useful, it fundamentally changes the content of the source paragraph, causing the low score. Additionally, the text fails the Fidelity Check, with a BERTScore of 0.8484, below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects the introduction of new sentences and significant rewrites that moved away from the original's wording. The text also failed the CEFR Compliance check, being classified as B2 instead of the target B1. This is likely due to complex sentence structures like 'When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about Theseus, a brave hero who fought the monster called the Minotaur,' and the retention of the C1-level word 'rebel'.
