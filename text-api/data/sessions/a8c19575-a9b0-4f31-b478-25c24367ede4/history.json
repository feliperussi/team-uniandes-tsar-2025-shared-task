        "feedback_text": "The text does not meet the B1 standard. The sentence 'She has written or helped to write more than 50 papers for important science magazines' uses the present perfect tense, which is acceptable, but its length of 16 words is borderline. The sentence 'In 2012, she also won a very special award called the Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' is also too long at 16 words. The term 'Academy' is C1 level and 'fellowship' is B2/C1. While they are part of a proper name, their inclusion without simplification or definition makes the text difficult for a B1 learner."
