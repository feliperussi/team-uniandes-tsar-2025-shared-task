The submission successfully passed the critical checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation, with excellent scores for both MeaningBERT (0.93) and BERTScore (0.95). The keyword 'gene' was also defined clearly and correctly. However, the simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a text that is easier than the B1 standard. This is likely because key B2 vocabulary like 'mutated' was simplified to the more basic 'change', and the overall sentence structures, while sometimes complex, were not enough to elevate the text to a B1 level according to the classifier. To improve, consider reintroducing slightly more complex vocabulary that is still accessible, or restructuring sentences to demonstrate a clearer B1 level of complexity. For example, using a phrase like 'a key genetic change' instead of just 'a change in a gene' could help raise the lexical profile.",

While the submission is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning well, with excellent MeaningBERT (0.92) and BERTScore (0.95) metrics, its vocabulary has been simplified too aggressively. Replacing complex terms like 'gene mutation' with 'genetic change' is good, but the cumulative effect of using many simple A1/A2 words ('change', 'special', 'part', 'connected', 'experience') has lowered the overall CEFR level. To reach the B1 target, consider reintroducing slightly more complex B1-level vocabulary where appropriate. For example, instead of 'did not experience this same change', a phrase like 'did not develop in the same way' could maintain B1 complexity while remaining clear.",

For example, the sentence 'For example, did a key change in a particular gene, which is a part of our DNA that controls how we grow, give us the ability to speak?' contains an embedded non-defining clause within a question, a structure more typical of a B2 level. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, break down long sentences. The example sentence could be simplified to: 'For example, did a change in a gene give us the ability to speak? A gene is a part of our DNA that controls how we grow.' Applying this principle to other complex sentences will help lower the text's complexity to the target B1 level.",
