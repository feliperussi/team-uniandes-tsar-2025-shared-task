A **gene** is a part of our DNA that controls how we grow. Researchers have found a specific genetic change that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to be linked to speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces. Although monkeys have a similar gene, it did not develop in the same way. It is too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary submission that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct, accurately preserving all key information, including the timeline (200,000 to 100,000 years ago). Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics are excellent (MeaningBERT: 0.86, BERTScore: 0.95), well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key phrasing were preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classifies as B1. Qualitative Analysis: The vocabulary strategy was executed perfectly. The keyword 'gene' was not only retained but also clearly defined within the text ('A gene is a part of our DNA that controls how we grow.'), which is a model of best practice. The simplification of complex concepts like 'mutated' to 'a change' is effective and appropriate for the target B1 level. The text flows well and is highly readable. No improvements are necessary.",
