    "text_translated": "Based on what we have found, we recommend that Girox Foods should start using a management style that focuses more on its people. For example, we should look for ways to offer working hours that can be changed and think about how we can allow employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers need to find different ways to give our staff interesting tasks, and they should also provide more positive feedback and give praise for the work they do. If we spend more money on professional training, especially for social and communication skills, this could also help to create a positive environment where employees can do their best work.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The text successfully passes the preliminary metrics and demonstrates strong communicative competence. The sentence structure is varied and effective, correctly using connectors to build complex ideas, such as in the conditional sentence beginning with 'If we spend more money...'. The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the B1 level, skillfully paraphrasing more advanced concepts from the original text (e.g., 'positive reinforcement' becomes 'positive feedback and give praise') without losing meaning. The paragraph is coherent, logically structured, and factually accurate.",
