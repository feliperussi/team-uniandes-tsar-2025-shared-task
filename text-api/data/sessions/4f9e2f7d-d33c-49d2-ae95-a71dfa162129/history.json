Many schools are using it to start discussions about topics like bullying, friendship and what it feels like to be different.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target, indicating oversimplification. While the text successfully preserves the original meaning and is factually accurate, the vocabulary and sentence structures are too basic for the B1 level. For example, the original phrase 'a girl with facial deformities' was simplified to 'a girl on the street whose face looked very different'. This simplification, while clear, removes the more advanced vocabulary that would contribute to a B1 classification. To meet the B1 target, consider using slightly more complex phrasing that remains accessible, such as 'a girl who had a condition that affected her face'. This would raise the linguistic complexity without returning to the difficulty of the original text.",

The output successfully maintains factual integrity and preserves the original meaning, as confirmed by the high MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.97) metrics. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies used are excellent. For instance, rephrasing the potentially difficult term 'facial deformities' into the more accessible phrase 'a condition that affected her face' is a model of good practice. Additionally, converting 'New Yorker' into the relative clause 'who is from New York' is an effective use of B1 grammar. The removal of the first-person perspective ('including me') was an appropriate choice that makes the text more objective. No further improvements are needed.",
