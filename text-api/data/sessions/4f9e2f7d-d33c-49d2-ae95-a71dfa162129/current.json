    "text_translated": "*Wonder* is the first novel by RJ Palacio, who is from New York. On her website, she explains that the idea for the book came to her one day after she saw a girl who had a condition that affected her face. The book has been a bestseller in the United States and has already won several awards. Many schools are using it to start discussions about topics like bullying, friendship and what it feels like to be different. A film version is also being made, and many people are waiting eagerly to see what RJ Palacio will write next.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The output successfully maintains factual integrity and preserves the original meaning, as confirmed by the high MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.97) metrics. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies used are excellent. For instance, rephrasing the potentially difficult term 'facial deformities' into the more accessible phrase 'a condition that affected her face' is a model of good practice. Additionally, converting 'New Yorker' into the relative clause 'who is from New York' is an effective use of B1 grammar. The removal of the first-person perspective ('including me') was an appropriate choice that makes the text more objective. No further improvements are needed.",
