The repetition of 'They use...' and 'You think about...' is unnatural and too simplistic, even for A2.\n\nSuggestion: Replace non-A2 vocabulary immediately. 'Ghost town' must be rephrased as 'a town where no one lives'. 'Phone coverage' must be rephrased as 'your phone cannot work'.

The original text explains that abandoned places are useful for directors because it is 'believable' that there is no phone service there. Your version changes this to 'That makes the story feel real', which is a different concept and alters the core logic. This is a secondary failure on fidelity. The BERTScore of 0.82 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key descriptive words like 'uninhabited', 'lonely', and 'believable' were removed, damaging the text's faithfulness to the source.
