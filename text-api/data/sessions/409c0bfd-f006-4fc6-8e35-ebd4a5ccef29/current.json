    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.64 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original message. The original text explains that abandoned places are useful for directors because it is 'believable' that there is no phone service there. Your version changes this to 'That makes the story feel real', which is a different concept and alters the core logic. This is a secondary failure on fidelity. The BERTScore of 0.82 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key descriptive words like 'uninhabited', 'lonely', and 'believable' were removed, damaging the text's faithfulness to the source. Suggestion: The final concept must be rewritten. Restore the original idea that the lack of phone service is a believable detail for the setting. For example: 'In these places, it is easy to believe that your phone will not work.'",
