    "text_translated": "Scientists are asking how genes help our brain and language to grow. Did a gene change a long time ago? Did this change give us language? Scientists found a gene that changed. This happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. This gene has a link with speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But in monkeys, this gene did not change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. But maybe one day we will find the answers in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The output meets all A2 standard requirements.\n- Factual Integrity: Maintained. All data points, including the timeframe (200,000 to 100,000 years ago) and the biological function (control of mouth and face), are correctly represented.\n- Metric Compliance: MeaningBERT (0.8172) and BERTScore (0.939) are well above the minimum thresholds, confirming high fidelity to the source text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as A2.\n- Structural Analysis: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to A2 sentence structure. It consistently uses short, simple sentences and basic connectors ('but'). This is the required standard.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level, with the exception of the key term 'gene', which was correctly identified as a necessary keyword. This demonstrates proper handling of essential, off-level terminology.",
