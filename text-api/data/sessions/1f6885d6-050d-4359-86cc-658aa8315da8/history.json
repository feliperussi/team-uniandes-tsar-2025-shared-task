Your output incorrectly reverses this to 'between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago'. This is an absolute failure and invalidates the entire text.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6669 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text discusses the 'influence' of genes and a 'connection' with speaking. Your version simplifies this to 'help us speak', which loses the core scientific meaning of a relationship rather than direct causation.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'gene' is a B2-level term. Its repeated use throughout the text exceeds the A2 vocabulary standard. An introductory definition is insufficient.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error with the dates immediately. Restore the original meaning by using A2-level words to describe a 'link' or 'connection'. Avoid repeated use of B2 vocabulary; rephrase sentences to describe the concept without using the complex word.",

The original text's core concept of 'the influence of genetics on language development' was lost and oversimplified to 'questions about these parts and language'.

The sentence 'It has a connection with...' is unacceptable.\n- Redundancy: The text uses 'link' (A2) and then 'connection' (B1) to express the same idea. This is inefficient and introduces a non-compliant word.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase the introduction to state that scientists are studying how genes affect language.\n- Suggestion: Remove the word 'connection'. The sentence using the A2 word 'link' is sufficient. The second sentence is redundant and must be deleted or rewritten using only A2 words.",

The original text does not provide a basic definition of genes; it begins by discussing research questions.\n\n- Loss of Core Concepts: The original's focus on the \"influence of genetics on brain and language development\" was oversimplified to \"how genes affect language.\" The key concept of \"development\" has been completely lost.\n\n- Vague Phrasing: The statement \"We do not know everything about this subject\" is too generic. It replaces the original's more precise idea that \"It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language,\" weakening the conclusion.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the fabricated introductory sentences. The text must only simplify the information provided, not add new definitions. Rephrase to restore the lost concepts. For example, instead of \"how genes affect language,\" use a phrase like \"how genes help our brain and language to grow.\" The text must be a simplification of the original, not a new text inspired by it.",
