    "text_translated": "NASA is making a list of asteroids. Asteroids are big rocks in space. NASA wants to list asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more. We think there are 25,000 of these asteroids. NASA has listed about 8,000. So, 17,000 are not on the list yet. We do not know about these 17,000. In 2013, a small asteroid came to Earth. It was 19 metres wide. It blew up over Chelyabinsk, a city in Russia. 1,200 people got hurt. The asteroids NASA is listing are 140 metres wide or more. These asteroids are much bigger than the 19-metre asteroid. So, these big asteroids are a very serious danger if they come to Earth.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6639 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The original text clearly links the purpose of logging asteroids to the serious danger they pose if they enter Earth's orbit, using the Chelyabinsk event as a direct example of this risk. Your version dilutes this crucial causal connection and the implied urgency of the 'unaccounted for' asteroids. The core message of proactive risk mitigation is weakened. The phrase 'We do not know about these 17,000' is a weak substitute for 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' which carries a stronger implication of risk and a lack of control. The original's 'Considering that...' establishes a direct causal link that is lost. Additional Deviations: 1. Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'making' in 'NASA is making a list' is classified as B2, exceeding the A2 vocabulary standard. 2. Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'listing' in 'NASA is listing' is classified as C1, significantly exceeding the A2 vocabulary standard. 3. CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the output as B2, not A2. This indicates the text's overall linguistic complexity is above the target level, likely due to the identified vocabulary issues and potentially the density of information, despite simple sentence structures.",
