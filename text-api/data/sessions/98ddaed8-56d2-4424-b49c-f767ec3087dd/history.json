Your version simplifies this to 'trying to find' and 'not found', which loses the nuance of a structured tracking program and the specific gap in its data. The original implies a proactive, ongoing effort to track, not just a general search.\n*   The original text uses 'Considering that...' to establish a direct causal link, explaining *why* the larger asteroids are a serious danger based on the Chelyabinsk event.

This weakens the logical flow and the implication of the threat.\n*   The phrase 'if they enter Earth's orbit' in the original specifies the condition for danger. Your simplification 'They can hit Earth' is less precise and loses this conditional aspect of the threat.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the introduction to better convey the systematic nature of NASA's 'logging' work and the specific problem of 'unaccounted for' asteroids.

While individual sentences are simple, the cumulative effect of information density and the slightly more complex sentence structures, such as 'So, bigger asteroids are a serious danger if they come to Earth', pushes the text beyond a clear A2 classification. The original's 'middle-sized asteroids' was a key descriptor for the 140m+ objects in contrast to the 19m one, which was not fully captured in the simplified phrasing. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the active and ongoing nature of NASA's work. Use A2-appropriate vocabulary to convey 'unaccounted for' more accurately.

The core message regarding NASA's systematic and ongoing effort to 'log' specific asteroids and the implication of 'unaccounted for' asteroids is not fully preserved. The original text emphasizes a proactive, systematic tracking effort, which is diluted in the simplified version. The nuance of 'working towards logging' is lost by 'is finding and recording' and 'wants to find', which are less precise about the systematic nature of the task. Similarly, 'unaccounted for' implies a known but untracked quantity, whereas 'still not found' could imply undiscovered, altering the original meaning of a known population needing systematic tracking. The original's emphasis on 'logging' as a specific, systematic record-keeping activity is not fully conveyed by the more general 'finding and recording'.",

While the factual details are present, the core message regarding the specific danger posed by the 17,000 'unaccounted for' asteroids is significantly diluted. The original text strongly links the large number of unlogged asteroids to the potential serious danger. Your version states the numbers and then separately concludes the danger, losing the critical causal connection and the urgency of the logging effort. The original implies the danger is from the unknown ones, while your version states the danger of all such asteroids generally. This is a critical loss of the original's emphasis. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly connect the '17,000 not on the list yet' with the 'very serious danger' they represent because they are unknown.",

Your version states 'The asteroids NASA is listing are much bigger. The small asteroid hurt many people. So, the 17,000 asteroids we do not know about are a very serious danger. This is if they come to Earth.' This phrasing weakens the direct comparison and the logical consequence of their larger size. The core message regarding the *magnitude* of the threat, directly linked to the specific size comparison, is diluted. Suggestion: Reconstruct the sentence to explicitly state that the 140-metre asteroids are a serious danger *because they are much larger* than the 19-metre asteroid that caused injury, thereby restoring the original's emphasis on the scale of the threat.",

The original text clearly links the purpose of logging asteroids to the serious danger they pose if they enter Earth's orbit, using the Chelyabinsk event as a direct example of this risk. Your version dilutes this crucial causal connection and the implied urgency of the 'unaccounted for' asteroids. The core message of proactive risk mitigation is weakened. The phrase 'We do not know about these 17,000' is a weak substitute for 'leaving 17,000 unaccounted for' which carries a stronger implication of risk and a lack of control. The original's 'Considering that...' establishes a direct causal link that is lost. Additional Deviations: 1. Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'making' in 'NASA is making a list' is classified as B2, exceeding the A2 vocabulary standard. 2. Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'listing' in 'NASA is listing' is classified as C1, significantly exceeding the A2 vocabulary standard. 3. CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the output as B2, not A2. This indicates the text's overall linguistic complexity is above the target level, likely due to the identified vocabulary issues and potentially the density of information, despite simple sentence structures.",
