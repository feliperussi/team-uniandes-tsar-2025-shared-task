However, it is good that bridges do not fall down very often, especially modern ones. This is because engineers have learned how to design bridges in places where earthquakes happen, so they are much more resistant to the ground's movement.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.7869) and BERTScore (0.9237) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'Earthquakes' at the beginning of the text, which is a strong point for B1 learners. Simplifications such as 'do not fall down very often' for 'relatively infrequent' and 'places where earthquakes happen' for 'earthquake zones' are well-executed and contribute to the B1 readability. The use of B1 connectors like 'However' and 'This is because... so' ensures a smooth and logical flow between sentences. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification that meets all requirements.",
