Although the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with a high MeaningBERT score of 0.8998, it over-simplified the content, falling below the required complexity for a B1 learner. The linguistic evidence for the A2 classification includes the use of short, declarative sentences and a vocabulary list dominated by A2 words ('recording', 'data', 'serious', 'danger'). The text lacks the sentence variety and B1-level connectors needed to meet the target. To correct this, consider combining sentences to create more complex structures. For example: 'Scientists believe there are about 25,000 of these asteroids, but so far, they have only recorded about 8,000.'

For example: 'NASA is now recording data about smaller asteroids. These asteroids are at least 140 metres wide. Scientists believe there are about 25,000 of them, but they have only recorded about 8,000 so far.'\n\nOn a positive note, the submission passed the first two critical checks: it is factually accurate and successfully preserved the original meaning, as evidenced by the high MeaningBERT score of 0.8584. The vocabulary simplification was also effective. However, the failure to adhere to the syntactic simplicity required for the target CEFR level is a critical error."

This is due to overly complex sentence structures.\n- Textual Evidence: \n  1. The sentence 'NASA is now recording data about smaller asteroids, which are at least 140 metres wide' uses a non-defining relative clause ('which are...'), a grammatical feature more common at the B2 level.\n  2. The sentence beginning with 'Although...' creates a subordinate clause that increases grammatical complexity beyond the typical B1 level.\n\nActionable Suggestions:\n- To achieve B1 compliance, break down the complex sentences:\n  - Suggestion 1: Rewrite 'NASA is now recording data about smaller asteroids, which are at least 140 metres wide.' as 'NASA is now recording data about smaller asteroids. These asteroids are at least 140 metres wide.'\n  - Suggestion 2: Rewrite 'Although scientists believe there are about 25,000 of these asteroids, they have only recorded about 8,000 so far.' as 'Scientists believe there are about 25,000 of these asteroids.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text fails because it does not meet the target B1 level, having been classified as B2. While the simplification is excellent in terms of clarity and factual accuracy, the linguistic features used have resulted in a text that is too advanced for the target audience according to the metric.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis: The B2 classification was likely triggered by the sentence: \"These asteroids would be a serious danger if they entered Earth's orbit.\" This is a second conditional structure ('would' + base verb... 'if' + past simple), which, while introduced at B1, is a hallmark of B2-level proficiency. The automated classifier probably identified this as a key indicator of a higher CEFR level.\n\nActionable Suggestion: To correct this and meet the B1 target, rephrase the conditional sentence. A simpler construction would be: \"These asteroids can be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.\" or \"It is a serious danger when these asteroids enter Earth's orbit.\"\n\nPositive Remarks: It is important to note that the submission passed the first two critical checks with high marks. Factual integrity was perfect, and the MeaningBERT score of 0.8569 is excellent, confirming that the core meaning was preserved. The strategy of splitting the final complex sentence into three simpler ones was also highly effective."
