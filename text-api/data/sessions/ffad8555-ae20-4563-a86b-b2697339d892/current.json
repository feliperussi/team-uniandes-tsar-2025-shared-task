    "text_translated": "NASA is currently working to record smaller asteroids. These asteroids measure 140 metres wide or more. Scientists estimate there are 25,000 asteroids of this size. However, only about 8,000 have been recorded so far. So, 17,000 have not yet been found. These asteroids can be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit. For example, a much smaller 19-metre asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013. It injured 1,200 people.",
