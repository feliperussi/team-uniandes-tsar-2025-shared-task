Your output did not adequately preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n*   Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6672 is significantly below the required 0.75. While your text mentions punishment, the original emphasizes the Capitol's use of the Games 'to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. Your version, 'It wants to punish the other places. This is because they fought the Capitol before,' loses the nuance of the Games as an ongoing reminder and a tool of control, simplifying it to a direct act of punishment. The initial definitions, while helpful, also shift the focus from the immediate description of the event's purpose.\n*   Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8912 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of specific and important vocabulary from the original text.\n    *   'districts' was replaced with 'other places'. This loses the specific political subdivision.\n    *   'rebelling' was replaced with 'fought the Capitol before'. This is a less concise and less specific term for the act of rebellion.\n    *   'lottery' was replaced with 'by chance'. 'Lottery' is a specific method of selection that should be retained or defined simply.\n    *   'battle' was replaced with 'fight'. While similar, 'battle' implies a more organized and significant conflict.\n    *   'teenagers' was replaced with 'young people'. 'Teenagers' specifies an age group more precisely than 'young people'.\n    *   'nation' was replaced with 'country'. 'Nation' often carries a stronger political connotation.\n\nCorrective Path:\n*   Rephrase the purpose of the Hunger Games to more accurately reflect the 'remind and punish' aspect, rather than just 'wants to punish'.\n*   Retain key vocabulary from the original text where possible, such as 'districts', 'rebelling', 'lottery', 'battle', and 'teenagers'. If these words are deemed too complex for A2, they must be defined in extremely simple A1/A2 terms within the context of the sentence, not simply replaced with less precise synonyms.",

Despite the CEFR classifier rating the text as A2, a deep qualitative audit reveals the use of several B1 and B2 level words without adequate simplification or definition, which is a direct violation of A2 vocabulary standards. The text fails to maintain strict A2 lexical compliance. Specific deviations include: The word 'remind' (B1) is used in 'It wants to remind the districts.' This word is above A2 level and should be simplified. The word 'district' (B1) is used multiple times (e.g., 'from each district'). This word is above A2 level and requires simplification or a simpler synonym. The word 'battle' (B1) is used in 'fight in a battle.' This word is above A2 level and should be simplified. The word 'nation' (B1) is used in 'All the people in the nation.' This word is above A2 level and requires simplification. The word 'means' (B2) is used in 'This means by chance.' While it serves to define 'lottery', the word 'means' itself is a B2 level word. An A2 alternative should be used, such as 'This is like chance' or 'This is chance'. Suggestion: Replace all identified B1 and B2 vocabulary with simpler A2 equivalents or provide clear, simple A2 definitions for each instance. For example, 'remind' could be 'tell again', 'district' could be 'area' or 'part of the country', 'battle' could be 'big fight', 'nation' could be 'country' or 'all the people in the country'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7678 and BERTScore of 0.9121 indicate good content preservation, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2, but a deep qualitative audit reveals critical deviations from A2 vocabulary standards. Specific deviations are as follows: The word 'powerful' (B1 level) is used in the sentence 'The Capitol is a powerful place.' This word is above the A2 vocabulary limit. The word 'remind' (B1 level) is used multiple times, for example, 'It wants to remind the areas.' and 'It reminds them that they rebelled.' This word is above the A2 vocabulary limit. The word 'lottery' (B1 level) is used in 'People choose them by lottery.' While an explanation 'This is like chance' is provided, the B1 word 'lottery' itself is used directly and is not a designated keyword for definition, making its direct inclusion a deviation. The keyword 'Capitol' was not defined in radically simple A2 terms. Its description 'The Capitol is a powerful place' uses the B1 word 'powerful', which is not an A2-level definition. The keyword 'tributes' was not defined in radically simple A2 terms. The text states 'These chosen teenagers are called tributes,' which is a statement of fact, not a definition using A2 vocabulary. Suggestion: Replace 'powerful' with A2 vocabulary such as 'very strong' or 'big and strong'. Replace 'remind' with A2 vocabulary such as 'tell them again' or 'make them think about'. Rephrase the sentence about 'lottery' to avoid the B1 word entirely, for example, 'People choose them by chance' or 'People choose them by drawing names from a hat'.

The original text emphasizes that the Hunger Games are used to 'remind' the districts of their punishment for rebelling.

This subtle but critical aspect of the original message is diminished. The BERTScore of 0.9057 is acceptable, indicating good lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2, indicating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level.
