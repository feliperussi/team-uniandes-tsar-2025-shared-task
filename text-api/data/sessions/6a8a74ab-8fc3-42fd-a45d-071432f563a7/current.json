    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.765) and BERTScore (0.9434) exceeded the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of core meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. The simplification strategy was effective, replacing more complex phrases like 'bridge collapses' with 'bridge falls down' and 'conduct a complete investigation' with 'do a full study'. Vocabulary candidates were handled well, with appropriate substitutions for A1-level words while retaining B1-level terms like 'mystery'. The sentence structure and use of connectors like 'Also, sometimes' contribute to a clear and coherent flow, making the text highly accessible without oversimplifying the content. This is a very strong simplification.",
