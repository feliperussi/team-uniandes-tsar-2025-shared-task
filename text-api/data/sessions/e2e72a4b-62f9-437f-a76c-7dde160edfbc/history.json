The core message and nuanced implications of the original text have been lost in simplification. The original text carefully contrasts the potential 'trouble' a good rider could encounter with 'even more trouble' for someone who knows nothing about horses and wants to escape. Your version, 'A good rider could find much trouble here. It was far from people. But more trouble could come. This was for a boy who did not know horses. He wanted to leave his father,' loses the comparative severity and the specific dilemma presented in the original. The sense of the vastness of the property and the futility of escape on foot is also diluted. The original's narrative tension and the specific nature of the boy's predicament are not fully conveyed. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the comparative nature of the 'trouble' and the specific implications for the boy's situation, ensuring the contrast between a skilled rider and an unskilled one is clear.",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message, nuance, and implied context. While the factual points are largely present, the overall semantic similarity and depth of meaning have been severely diminished. Specific deviations contributing to this failure include: The original's 'rebellious a teenage boy' was simplified to 'bored or angry boy', losing key character motivation and age context. The specific 'escape on foot' was generalized to 'walk away from here', reducing the vividness of the constraint. The superlative 'biggest of the horses' was reduced to 'a big horse', losing a detail. The descriptive 'heavy hooves' was simplified to 'Its feet were big', losing specific vocabulary. The idiomatic 'whole load of trouble' was reduced to 'much trouble', diminishing the expressive quality. The specific 'miles away from anyone' was generalized to 'far from people', losing a sense of scale. These cumulative simplifications have stripped too much of the original's meaning, resulting in a text that is factually similar but semantically impoverished. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain more of the original's descriptive power and implied meaning while still adhering to A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. Focus on preserving the nuances of character and setting.",

While the factual content is present, the nuanced meaning and emphasis of the original text have been diminished. The original text conveys a stronger sense of vastness, difficulty, and emphasis that is lost in the simplification. For example, 'stretched as far as the eye could see' implies an overwhelming scale, which is reduced to a simple statement in 'could not see the end of it'. Similarly, 'barely visible' conveys a greater distance and difficulty in perception than 'far away'. The phrase 'a whole load of trouble' is more emphatic than 'much trouble'. These cumulative reductions in descriptive power and emotional weight result in a loss of the original's intended impact and meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to retain the original's descriptive strength and emphasis while strictly adhering to A2 vocabulary and grammar. Focus on conveying the *feeling* or *implication* of the original, not just the bare facts. For instance, instead of 'The land was very big. They could not see the end of it.', consider 'The land was so big they could not see its end.' or 'The land went on and on, very far.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6344 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of core message and nuance from the original text. While the BERTScore of 0.9108 is acceptable, the deeper meaning has been compromised. Specific deviations include: The original text's nuance of 'rebellious' is diluted. While 'He might not like rules and want to leave' is an A2 simplification, it loses the stronger implication of defiance and potential for trouble that 'rebellious' conveys, which is central to the boy's character and the narrative's tension. The specific context of 'property' is lost by simplifying to 'land'. 'Property' implies a defined, owned area, which is crucial for understanding the challenge of escape. 'Land' is too generic. The narrative connection between the general statement about 'A teenage boy' and Sam's specific thought about 'the boy' is weakened. The original text more cohesively links the boy's potential for rebellion to the difficulty of escape. Suggestion: Rephrase the description of the boy's character to better capture the essence of 'rebellious' while remaining within A2 vocabulary. For example, 'He might want to do bad things and not follow rules.' Suggestion: Use a more specific A2 term for 'property' that conveys a defined area, rather than the generic 'land'. Suggestion: Ensure the connection between the boy's character and the challenge of escape is clearly maintained across sentences to preserve narrative coherence.",

The original text conveys a speculative and pondering tone, particularly in Sam's internal thoughts about the boy's potential escape and the varying degrees of trouble. Phrases like 'he wondered' and 'But maybe there was even more trouble' are replaced by more declarative statements in the output, such as 'Sam thought about the boy' and 'He could find even more trouble'. This shift loses the nuanced, reflective aspect of the original message, which is critical to its core meaning. Additionally, the word 'rider' is classified as B1. For strict A2 compliance, this word should be simplified to an A2 equivalent, such as 'a person who rides a horse' or 'someone on a horse'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6543 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message and nuances of the original text. While the text is factually accurate and lexically simplified to A2, the deeper meaning has been compromised.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6543 is too low. The core meaning of the original text, particularly the nuanced description of the boy's 'rebellious' nature and the specific contrast of 'trouble' for different types of riders, has been diluted.\n2.  Loss of Nuance for 'rebellious': The original text uses 'rebellious' to describe a character trait. Your version breaks this into 'want to do bad things' and 'not follow rules'. While these are related, they do not fully capture the singular, stronger concept of being rebellious as a state of being.\n3.  Dilution of Specificity: The phrase 'northern end of the property' is simplified to 'north' and 'land they owned'. This loses the precise geographical detail and the sense of the property's boundary.\n4.  Weakening of Emphasis: 'A whole load of trouble' is simplified to 'much trouble'. This reduces the original's emphasis on the significant amount of danger or difficulty.\n5.  Subtle Loss in Contrast: The original text clearly contrasts the trouble a 'good rider could get into' (implying agency or adventure) with 'even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses'. Your version, while stating 'even more trouble', slightly blurs the distinct nature of the trouble for each scenario.\n\nCorrective Path:\n1.  Rephrase the description of the boy's character to more accurately convey the concept of 'rebellious' as a disposition, rather than just a list of actions.\n2.  Ensure that the specific location 'northern end of the property' is communicated with greater precision while remaining within A2 vocabulary.\n3.  Strengthen the phrasing used to describe the 'trouble' to reflect the original's emphasis on its significant quantity.\n4.  Clarify the distinct implications of 'trouble' for a skilled rider versus an unskilled one, maintaining the original's contrast.",
