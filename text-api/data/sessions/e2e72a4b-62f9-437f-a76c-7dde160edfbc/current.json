A teenage boy might be bored. He might want to do bad things. He might not follow rules. He might want to leave this place. But he could not get away on foot.\n\nSam looked at the biggest horse. It kicked the ground. Its heavy feet were hard. Sam wondered if the boy could ride. He thought about the trouble. A person who rides a horse well could find much trouble. This place was far from anyone. But maybe a boy did not know horses. He could find even more trouble. The boy wanted to run away from his father.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6543 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a failure to preserve the core message and nuances of the original text. While the text is factually accurate and lexically simplified to A2, the deeper meaning has been compromised.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n1.  Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6543 is too low. The core meaning of the original text, particularly the nuanced description of the boy's 'rebellious' nature and the specific contrast of 'trouble' for different types of riders, has been diluted.\n2.  Loss of Nuance for 'rebellious': The original text uses 'rebellious' to describe a character trait. Your version breaks this into 'want to do bad things' and 'not follow rules'. While these are related, they do not fully capture the singular, stronger concept of being rebellious as a state of being.\n3.  Dilution of Specificity: The phrase 'northern end of the property' is simplified to 'north' and 'land they owned'. This loses the precise geographical detail and the sense of the property's boundary.\n4.  Weakening of Emphasis: 'A whole load of trouble' is simplified to 'much trouble'. This reduces the original's emphasis on the significant amount of danger or difficulty.\n5.  Subtle Loss in Contrast: The original text clearly contrasts the trouble a 'good rider could get into' (implying agency or adventure) with 'even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses'. Your version, while stating 'even more trouble', slightly blurs the distinct nature of the trouble for each scenario.\n\nCorrective Path:\n1.  Rephrase the description of the boy's character to more accurately convey the concept of 'rebellious' as a disposition, rather than just a list of actions.\n2.  Ensure that the specific location 'northern end of the property' is communicated with greater precision while remaining within A2 vocabulary.\n3.  Strengthen the phrasing used to describe the 'trouble' to reflect the original's emphasis on its significant quantity.\n4.  Clarify the distinct implications of 'trouble' for a skilled rider versus an unskilled one, maintaining the original's contrast.",
