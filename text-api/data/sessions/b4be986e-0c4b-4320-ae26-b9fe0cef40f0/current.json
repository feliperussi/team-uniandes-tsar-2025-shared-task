Every year, one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 are chosen from each district by lottery to compete in a battle where only one person can survive. The chosen teenagers are called 'tributes', which is the name given to the people who must fight. The whole nation is forced to watch the event on television.",

    "feedback": "Excellent work. The text successfully passes all checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. The simplification is clear and effective. The keyword 'tributes' was handled perfectly by integrating a clear definition directly into the text, which is a model example of how to manage key vocabulary. The simplification of the C1 word 'rebellion' was also well done. For future improvement, note that the B2-level word 'being' was retained in the phrase 'are being punished'. While acceptable here, a simpler alternative like 'are punished' could also be considered to further reduce complexity. Overall, this is a high-quality simplification that meets all core requirements.",
