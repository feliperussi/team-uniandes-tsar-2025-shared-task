Your version weakens this to \"works very hard\" and \"help itself\", losing the critical concepts of lifelong commitment and self-reliance.\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8929 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of replacing key original phrases like \"international humanitarian projects\" and \"change attitudes\" with overly simple terms, which reduces lexical fidelity.\n- Factual Omission: The original text states Wasfia took up climbing while working on campaigns in Tibet and Nepal. This information is completely absent from your output, which is a loss of key context.\n- Analysis: While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with the A2 level, this is irrelevant. The primary duty is to preserve the meaning and facts of the original text. This output fails that duty.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the concept of Wasfia's lifelong dedication. Re-introduce the idea that Bangladesh must become self-reliant because previous international projects failed.

The original text establishes a direct cause-and-effect link.\n- Evidence: The original states that after projects failed, 'Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself and so she brought together two of her passions'. Your version breaks this link with the sequence: 'The women were left with nothing. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself. So she had an idea.' The phrase 'So she had an idea' is too generic and severs the logical connection, weakening the entire narrative.\n- The text also loses the nuance of Wasfia 'witnessing' the failures, which was a key part of her personal motivation. Your version is too detached.\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure meet A2 standards, this is irrelevant when the fundamental meaning is compromised.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the cause-and-effect relationship. Explicitly state that seeing the projects fail is what motivated her to combine her passions. For example: 'Because Wasfia saw these projects fail, she knew Bangladesh needed a new idea. So, she decided to use her two passions...'",
