    "text_translated": "In the 1950s, banana companies in Central America had a big problem. Their `Gros Michel banana` was dying. This banana was the product that made them the most money. People called it Big Mike.\n\nNow, the same problem is happening again. It is happening to the `Cavendish` banana. The `Cavendish` banana came after Big Mike. It was Big Mike's successor.\n\nThe `Gros Michel banana` was a fruit. It was easy to move. It had thick skin and tasted sweet. This banana was the main one on many big farms in Central America.\n\nUnited Fruit was a big company. It was the main company for bananas in South America. It grew bananas. It also sent them to other countries. This company grew many bananas. They did it in the best and fastest way. They cloned shoots from the plant stems. This means they made exact copies. They did not grow them from seeds. They grew the plants in fields. The plants were very close together.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required metrics for preserving the original meaning and lexical fidelity. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6849 is below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of core message. The BERTScore of 0.8962 is below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. Specific deviations are listed below.\n\nMeaning Preservation Deviations:\n- The original text's emphasis on 'most lucrative product' and 'dominated the plantations' is weakened. Your version states 'made them the most money' and 'main one on many big farms', which loses the strong commercial impact and market control implied by the original.\n- The concept of 'mass-produced' and 'most efficient way possible' is simplified to 'grew many bananas' and 'best and fastest way'. While conveying the general idea, it dilutes the specific meaning of industrial-scale efficiency.\n\nFidelity Deviations (Lexical Loss):\n- Original phrase 'commercial banana growers' was simplified to 'banana companies'. The term 'commercial growers' provides more specific detail.\n- The word 'lucrative' was not directly replaced with an A2 equivalent that fully captures its meaning.\n- The word 'dominated' was replaced with 'main one on many big farms', losing the strong sense of control and prevalence.\n- The term 'mass-produced' was replaced with 'grew many bananas', losing the specific production method.\n- The word 'efficient' was replaced with 'best and fastest', which is a less precise term for efficiency in a commercial context.\n- The phrase 'cultivated them in densely packed fields' was broken down and simplified, losing the specific vocabulary of 'cultivated' and 'densely packed' as a combined concept.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification process to ensure that while vocabulary is simplified, the core commercial and descriptive power of the original text is retained. Focus on finding A2 synonyms or simple phrases that more accurately reflect the original's lexical content and meaning. For example, 'lucrative' could be 'made a lot of money' or 'very profitable'. 'Dominated' could be 'was the most important' or 'was everywhere'. 'Efficient' could be 'did things in a very good way to save time and money'.",
