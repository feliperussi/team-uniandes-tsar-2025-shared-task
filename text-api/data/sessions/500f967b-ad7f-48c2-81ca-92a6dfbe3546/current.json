However, it is very important that we also remember that cultural stereotypes (fixed ideas about how all people from a country or group behave) can seriously damage good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping how we behave and think, we are also greatly influenced by the region we come from, the groups of people we spend time with, our age and gender, the way a company works, and our own experiences. Therefore, we should keep the knowledge of these possible differences in mind, rather than using it to put all people from a country into one small group.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.7766) and BERTScore (0.9388) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. The writer successfully defined the keyword 'stereotypes' in a clear and concise manner, which is crucial for B1 comprehension. Complex phrases such as 'increased awareness,' 'expectations and behaviour,' 'cases of miscommunication,' 'detrimental to building good business relationships,' 'communities we associate with,' 'corporate culture,' 'at the back of our minds,' and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' were all skillfully rephrased into simpler, more accessible B1 language without losing any of the original meaning. The use of B1 connectors like 'However,' 'Although,' and 'Therefore' ensures a smooth and logical flow. The sentence structure is varied and appropriate for the target level. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
