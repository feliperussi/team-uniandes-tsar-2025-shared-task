While the vocabulary simplification and keyword definition are well-executed, the sentence structure and length remain too advanced for B1. For example, the sentence 'Although national cultures can affect how we act and think, we are also influenced a lot by the region we come from, the groups we belong to, our age and gender, our company's culture, and our own experiences.' is 40 words long and contains multiple clauses and a long list of influences, making it challenging for a B1 learner to process. Similarly, the sentence 'But it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes, which are fixed ideas about what a type of person or thing is like, can be bad for building good business relationships.' is 30 words long and includes an embedded relative clause that increases its complexity beyond typical B1 expectations. To achieve a B1 level, these longer sentences should be split into shorter, simpler sentences. For instance, the 40-word sentence could be broken down into: 'National cultures can affect how we act and think. But many other things also influence us. These include the region we come from, the groups we belong to, our age, our gender, our company's culture, and our own experiences.' The definition of 'stereotypes' is helpful, but the sentence containing it could also be split to reduce its overall length and structural complexity.",

While the writer made good efforts to simplify vocabulary and break down some complex sentences, the overall linguistic complexity remains too high for a consistent B1 level. For example, the sentence 'Knowing about possible differences in what people expect and how they behave can help us avoid misunderstandings' contains a complex noun clause ('what people expect and how they behave') that might be challenging for a B1 learner. Additionally, the sentence 'These include the region we come from, the groups we belong to, our age, our gender, our company's culture, and our own experiences' is quite long and lists several abstract concepts, which collectively push the complexity beyond B1. To achieve a B1 level, consider simplifying the structure of the first sentence, perhaps by splitting the ideas or rephrasing the noun clause. For the second sentence, breaking it into two shorter sentences or simplifying some of the listed items (e.g., 'our company's culture' could be 'the way our company works') would help reduce its complexity.

However, it is very important that we also remember that cultural stereotypes (fixed ideas about how all people from a country or group behave) can seriously damage good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping how we behave and think, we are also greatly influenced by the region we come from, the groups of people we spend time with, our age and gender, the way a company works, and our own experiences. Therefore, we should keep the knowledge of these possible differences in mind, rather than using it to put all people from a country into one small group.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.7766) and BERTScore (0.9388) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. The writer successfully defined the keyword 'stereotypes' in a clear and concise manner, which is crucial for B1 comprehension. Complex phrases such as 'increased awareness,' 'expectations and behaviour,' 'cases of miscommunication,' 'detrimental to building good business relationships,' 'communities we associate with,' 'corporate culture,' 'at the back of our minds,' and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' were all skillfully rephrased into simpler, more accessible B1 language without losing any of the original meaning. The use of B1 connectors like 'However,' 'Although,' and 'Therefore' ensures a smooth and logical flow. The sentence structure is varied and appropriate for the target level. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
