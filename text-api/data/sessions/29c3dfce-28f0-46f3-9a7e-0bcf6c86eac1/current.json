    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.696 is below the required 0.75. The writer's output introduces new information not present in the original text, specifically 'Organic molecules are important for life'. This addition alters the core message. Furthermore, the nuance of methane being 'another of the most basic organic molecules' is lost, replaced by the less specific 'This was another discovery' and 'Methane is a very simple molecule. It is an organic molecule.' The original's emphasis on methane's fundamental nature as a basic organic molecule is not fully preserved. Suggestion: Remove information not present in the original text. Ensure all key attributes of methane mentioned in the original are accurately and simply conveyed.",
