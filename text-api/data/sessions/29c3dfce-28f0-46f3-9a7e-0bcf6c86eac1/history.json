The core message regarding the scientific significance of methane as 'another of the most basic organic molecules' was lost in the simplification. The output reduces this to 'a simple gas', which diminishes the original text's emphasis on the importance of the discovery.\n\nDeviations:\n- Meaning Preservation: The phrase 'another of the most basic organic molecules' was simplified to 'a simple gas'. While aiming for A2, this specific simplification removed a crucial aspect of the original meaning, which highlighted methane's scientific importance as an organic compound. The definition of 'methane' in the output also failed to capture this key detail.\n- Vocabulary: The word 'breathing' is classified as B1, but it was used directly in the sentence 'It is like the planet Mars is breathing.' For A2, this concept needs to be rephrased using simpler vocabulary or a more direct comparison without using the B1 term.\n\nSuggestion: To improve meaning preservation, rephrase the description of methane to convey its significance as a fundamental building block, even if simplified.

The core message of the original text has been altered and diluted. The text fails to accurately convey the scientific details and nuances of the original. Specific deviations include: The original text describes methane as 'another of the most basic organic molecules and a key ingredient of natural gas'. Your version simplifies this to 'It is a basic part of life. It is also in natural gas.' The phrase 'basic part of life' is an inaccurate and misleading interpretation of 'basic organic molecules', which are chemical compounds, not necessarily components of living organisms. The nuance of 'key ingredient' is also lost by simply stating 'also in natural gas'. The original text states methane 'only survives a few hundred years' and that something is 'replenishing the supply'. Your version uses 'does not stay for a long time' and 'makes new methane'. While conveying the general idea, 'makes new methane' lacks the precise implication of continuous, ongoing replenishment that 'replenishing the supply' carries. The original text mentions Mars emits 'thousands of tons of methane at a time'. Your version states 'It sends out thousands of tons', omitting the important temporal aspect 'at a time'. Suggestion: Rephrase the description of methane to accurately reflect 'basic organic molecules' without implying it is a component of life. Ensure the concept of 'key ingredient' is preserved. Use language that clearly conveys continuous replenishment. Restore the temporal detail 'at a time'.",

The core meaning of the original text, specifically that methane is an 'organic molecule', was lost in the simplification. Describing it only as 'simple' and 'basic' removes a crucial scientific detail.\n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'basic' is classified as B1 in your provided vocabulary candidates, yet it is used in the sentence 'It is a basic molecule.' A2 vocabulary must be strictly adhered to.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'molecule' is likely a B1 or B2 term and is not suitable for A2.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'tons' is likely a B1 term and is not suitable for A2.\n- Structural Deviation: The sentence 'NASA says Mars sends out thousands of tons of methane at a time' implies a 'that-clause' ('NASA says that Mars...'), which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- Structural Deviation: The phrasal verb 'sends out' can be considered B1.\n- Structural Deviation: The phrase 'takes air in and out' is an idiomatic expression that can be considered B1.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the description of methane to include the concept of 'organic' in A2 terms, or acknowledge its omission. Replace all B1 vocabulary with A2 equivalents. Simplify sentence structures to avoid implied 'that-clauses' and complex phrasal verbs.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The writer's output contains two significant factual errors. First, the original text's 'another of the most basic organic molecules' was incorrectly simplified to 'a type of gas from living things'. While methane is an organic molecule, implying it is 'from living things' on Mars is a misinterpretation of the scientific context, as the original text does not suggest a biological origin on Mars. Second, and more critically, 'thousands of tons of methane' was inaccurately converted to 'many thousands of kilos of methane'. One ton is 1000 kilograms, so 'thousands of tons' would be millions of kilograms, not thousands. This is a direct numerical error. These inaccuracies fundamentally distort the original message.",
