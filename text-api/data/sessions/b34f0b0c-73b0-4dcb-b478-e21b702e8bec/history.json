The MeaningBERT score of 0.70 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a failure to preserve the core message. The BERTScore of 0.89 is also below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text's central point is that people 'might not realise they are part of the disposable clothing problem'. Your version, 'They think this is a good thing', is a weak replacement. It fails to communicate the critical concept of people's unawareness and their direct role in a specific problem.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score dropped because essential B1-level concepts were replaced with overly generic A2 terms, losing fidelity. The original's 'economic and environmental problems' is specific. Your version, 'bad for their money and for our world', is too simple and loses the precise meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Loss: Key terms like 'disposable', 'quantities', 'abroad', 'economic', and 'environmental' were removed. While simplification is required, the replacements were not adequate to maintain meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the core idea that people do not know they are causing a problem. Rephrase to more accurately reflect the concepts of 'economic' and 'environmental' issues using A2 language. For example: 'This causes problems for business and money in those countries, and it is bad for nature.'",

The submission fails on two critical metrics before CEFR compliance can even be considered.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.72 is below the required 0.75. The original text's core concept of a 'disposable clothing problem' was oversimplified to 'a big problem', which loses the specific meaning of clothes being treated as throwaway items. The core message has been diluted.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.89 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key lexical information. Phrases like 'huge quantities' and 'economic and environmental problems' were replaced with simpler but less precise terms like 'a lot of clothes' and 'bad for their businesses and money... bad for nature'. While simplification is necessary, this level of simplification has damaged the factual fidelity to the source text.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the core concept of 'disposable' clothing using simple A2 language. For example, 'a problem with clothes that people throw away quickly'. Rephrase to more closely match the original's key terms while maintaining A2 structure. The current version is too simple and has lost too much of the original message.",
