    "feedback": "FAIL: Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Standard. The text passed automated checks but failed the qualitative audit due to the inclusion of words above the A2 level. This is a critical error.\n\n- Deviation 1: The word 'quantities' is B2 level. It was used in the sentence: \"So, huge quantities of clothes are thrown away.\" This is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\n- Deviation 2: The words 'economic' and 'environmental' are B1 level. They were used in the sentence: \"This causes more economic and environmental problems.\" These abstract concepts must be simplified for an A2 audience.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace 'huge quantities of' with 'a lot of' or 'many'.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'economic and environmental problems'. Use simpler language. Example: 'This causes more problems with money and for nature.'",
