    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core message and lexical fidelity of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6336 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a nuanced approach where councils 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly' by 'allowing them to work in designated areas'. Your version simplifies this to 'Councils do not want artists to paint graffiti everywhere. So, councils give artists special places to paint.', which loses the collaborative and encouraging aspect, making it sound like a simple prohibition and provision. The BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key lexical detail. For example, 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly' was not adequately preserved, and 'designated areas' was replaced with 'special places', which, while simpler, reduces lexical fidelity. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening to better capture the original's intent of encouraging artists to use specific areas rather than simply stopping them from painting everywhere. Ensure key phrases are retained or simplified with higher lexical similarity.",
