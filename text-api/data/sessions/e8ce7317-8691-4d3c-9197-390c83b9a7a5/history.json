The MeaningBERT score of 0.5667 is significantly below the required 0.75. The BERTScore of 0.8969 is also below the required 0.90. The primary issue is a fundamental shift in the core message and a loss of specific details. The original text focuses on how councils are actively managing and encouraging artists in designated areas. Your version begins with a general definition of graffiti and then describes what city leaders 'do not want' before introducing the solutions. This changes the emphasis from proactive management to a reactive problem-solution narrative, losing the nuance of 'encouraging artists' and 'allowing them to work'. Specific deviations include: The opening definition of 'Graffiti is pictures or words painted on walls. People often paint it without asking.' is not the main point of the original text and dilutes its core message about council actions. The phrase 'City leaders do not want this' is a simplification that loses the original's specific intent of 'councils have tried to encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly'. The term 'subway trains' was simplified to 'trains', losing a specific detail. The overall structure and emphasis do not align with the original's focus on the specific methods councils use to manage graffiti. Suggestion: Rephrase the introduction to immediately convey the original's main idea: how cities are managing graffiti. Ensure that the specific actions of 'encouraging artists' and 'allowing them to work in designated areas' are clearly communicated.

The nuance of the original's approach is lost. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8987 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. For example, \"councils\" was replaced with \"cities\" and \"city leaders\", \"encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly\" was simplified to \"want to stop graffiti on all walls\", and \"subway trains\" became \"city trains\". While simplification is necessary for A2, the lexical overlap with the original has fallen below the acceptable threshold. The initial sentence \"Graffiti is pictures or words painted on walls\" is an addition not present in the original text's core message. While it defines the keyword, it contributes to the deviation from the original's primary focus and content. Suggestion: Rephrase the opening sentences to more accurately reflect the original's intent of managing graffiti by providing designated areas, rather than implying a desire to stop all graffiti. Ensure key terms and concepts from the original are preserved more closely, even if simplified, to meet the BERTScore threshold. For example, instead of \"stop graffiti on all walls\", consider \"help artists paint graffiti in special places, not on other walls\".",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5989 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's core meaning. The BERTScore of 0.89 is also below the required 0.90, showing a loss of key lexical detail. Meaning and fidelity are not preserved.\n\n*   Meaning Preservation: The original text conveys that councils actively *encourage* artists to paint in *designated areas* to *prevent random graffiti*. Your version simplifies this to \"Councils want to stop artists painting everywhere. They give artists special places to paint.\" This simplification loses the core message of the original's proactive, managed approach involving encouragement and specific allowances. The nuance of 'encouraging' and 'allowing them to work in designated areas' as a solution is absent.\n*   Lexical Fidelity: The BERTScore is low due to the omission of key phrases and concepts. The original's detailed phrasing of \"encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly on walls by allowing them to work in designated areas\" is not adequately represented. Critical terms like \"encourage,\" \"randomly,\" and \"designated areas\" are either lost or overly simplified, leading to a significant lexical deviation.\n*   Vocabulary: The word \"means\" in the sentence \"Graffiti means pictures or words on walls\" is listed as B2 in your provided Vocabulary Candidates for Replacement. This is a deviation from strict A2 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the initial sentences to accurately reflect the original's message of councils *allowing* artists to paint in *specific, approved places* to *manage* graffiti, rather than simply 'stopping' them. Restore the concept of 'designated areas' or 'special places' as a solution. Replace \"means\" with an A1/A2 structure, for example, \"Graffiti is pictures or words on walls.\".",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6504 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8973 is also below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text emphasizes that councils 'tried to encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly' by providing designated areas. Your version, 'Some councils let artists paint graffiti. Councils give artists special places to paint. This helps to stop artists painting graffiti everywhere,' loses the nuance of 'encourage not to paint randomly' and the initial problem of random graffiti. The core message of proactive encouragement to prevent a specific issue is diluted.\n- Lexical Fidelity Failure: Key terms from the original text were not adequately preserved or were overly simplified, leading to the low BERTScore. For example, 'encourage artists not to paint graffiti randomly' was simplified to 'stop artists painting graffiti everywhere', losing specific lexical detail. 'Designated areas' was simplified to 'special places'. While simplification is necessary for A2, the current approach has sacrificed too much lexical detail.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the opening to clearly state the problem of random graffiti and the council's action to prevent it, rather than just stating they 'let artists paint'. The original intent of 'encourage not to paint randomly' must be explicitly conveyed in A2 terms.\n- Ensure that key concepts like 'designated areas' are translated with A2 vocabulary that maintains closer lexical fidelity to the original meaning, such as 'special places for painting' or 'places where they can paint'.",
