    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required range. MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9058 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and key terms. The CEFR classifier correctly rated the text as A2.\n- Structural Simplification: The writer correctly deconstructed complex sentences into short, simple declarative statements. The use of connectors is limited to appropriate A2-level words ('when', 'but').\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary simplification is exemplary. 'Upsetting' was correctly replaced with 'sad', and 'frightening' with 'scary'. The B1 word 'force' is present but is part of the proper noun 'US Air Force' and is therefore non-negotiable for factual accuracy. This is a correct and necessary exception. The output is a model of A2 simplification.",
