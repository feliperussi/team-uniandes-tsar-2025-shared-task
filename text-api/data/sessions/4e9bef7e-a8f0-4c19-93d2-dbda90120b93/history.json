        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. While the text passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, the simplification was too aggressive. The primary reason for the A2 classification is the over-simplification of vocabulary. For example, replacing 'terrified' with 'very scared' and completely removing the word 'immediate' from the phrase 'no immediate interest' lowered the lexical complexity too far. To elevate this text to B1, consider reintroducing slightly more complex vocabulary or rephrasing to retain the original's subtle meanings. For instance, 'has no immediate interest' could be simplified to 'is not interested in eating him right now' to preserve the temporal nuance while remaining clear.",

The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.98) are exceptionally high, confirming that the core meaning and key details were preserved with great fidelity. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary changes were subtle but effective, such as replacing 'till' with the more standard 'until' and 'are left' with 'remain', which skillfully maintains the B1 level. The structure and flow are clear and logical. No corrective actions are needed.",
