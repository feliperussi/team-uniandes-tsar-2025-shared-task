One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, until only Pi and the tiger remain.

    "feedback": "This output is an excellent example of a successful B1 simplification and passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.98) are exceptionally high, confirming that the core meaning and key details were preserved with great fidelity. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The vocabulary changes were subtle but effective, such as replacing 'till' with the more standard 'until' and 'are left' with 'remain', which skillfully maintains the B1 level. The structure and flow are clear and logical. No corrective actions are needed.",
