    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All core concepts have been preserved without error.\n\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required parameters. The MeaningBERT score of 0.86 and BERTScore of 0.92 confirm that meaning and key phrasing were successfully retained. The CEFR Classifier result is correctly A2.\n\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The complex term 'self-disclosure' was correctly identified as a keyword and defined perfectly using simple A2 language: 'Self-disclosure is when you talk about your personal feelings with someone.'\n\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's longer sentences and more complex ideas have been expertly deconstructed into short, simple sentences suitable for an A2 reader. The use of connectors is appropriately basic. This submission meets all requirements of the A2 standard without deviation.",
