The MeaningBERT score of 0.87 and BERTScore of 0.92 confirm that the core message and key terms were preserved with high fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids all B1-level grammatical structures and vocabulary.\n- Structural Excellence: The writer correctly broke down longer, more complex sentences from the original into short, simple, and clear sentences. This is the required standard for A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. The B2-level keyword 'self-disclosure' was correctly identified and defined using simple A2 language, which is a perfect execution of the task.",
