    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Some asteroids can be dangerous. We call these dangerous asteroids 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' (PHAs). These asteroids fly less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth. NASA has a map of 1,400 PHAs. But none of them are a danger for the next 100 years. NASA has technology to follow these rocks. It can see if they are going to hit Earth. If an asteroid is a danger, NASA has two plans to protect us.",
