        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6197 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The primary error is the oversimplification of the definition for 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. The original text specifies a factual boundary: 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your version, 'when they fly very near to Earth', is too vague and removes this essential, defining fact. This constitutes both a factual inaccuracy and a failure to preserve meaning. While the text successfully adheres to A2 sentence structure and vocabulary, this cannot compensate for the loss of key information. Suggestion: Restore the core factual information. The specific distance is a key fact and must be included. Rephrase the sentence to state the number simply."

The metrics confirm an A2 classification. The vocabulary audit shows no words above the A2 level.\n- Structural Simplicity: Complex clauses from the original text have been effectively rephrased into simple A2 structures. For example, 'at which point two defence solutions could be launched' was correctly simplified to 'If an asteroid is a danger, NASA has two plans to protect us.'\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8171 and BERTScore of 0.9077 confirm that the core message and key terms have been retained with high fidelity."

The simplification of complex concepts like 'defence solutions' to 'two plans to protect us' is executed flawlessly. No deviations were found."

The text is correctly classified as A2, successfully simplifying the original without becoming overly simplistic (A1).\n- Vocabulary Control: Perfect. The B2-level word 'potentially' was correctly removed. All vocabulary used is within the A1/A2 range. The keyword 'Asteroids' is defined in the first sentence using simple A2 terms ('big rocks that fly in space').\n- Structural Simplicity: Excellent. The text uses short, simple sentences.
