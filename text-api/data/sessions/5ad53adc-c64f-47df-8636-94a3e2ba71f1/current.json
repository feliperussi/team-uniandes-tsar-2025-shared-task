    "feedback": "The submission is a PASS with a high grade. It successfully passed all priority checks. Factual Integrity: All key information, including names, numbers, and dates, was preserved accurately. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.93) are excellent, indicating that the core message and key terms were retained effectively. CEFR Compliance: The text was correctly classified as B1. The simplification strategy is a model of good practice. The decision to explain the complex term 'peer-reviewed' as 'checked by other scientists' is particularly effective for the target audience. Furthermore, complex sentences from the original were successfully broken down into shorter, clearer sentences, which greatly improves readability. Vocabulary choices such as replacing 'prestigious' with 'important' and 'extensively' with 'a lot' are appropriate and well-executed.",
