    "feedback": "PASS: Exemplary Adherence to A2 Standard.\n\nThe output successfully passes all diagnostic checks. It is a textbook example of simplification to the A2 CEFR level.\n\n- Factual Integrity: Confirmed. All key facts, names, and numbers from the original text were preserved without error.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are within required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.77 and BERTScore at 0.91 indicate successful preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct. The text is a clear and unambiguous example of this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The audit confirms strict compliance. Vocabulary is restricted to the A2 level. Complex B1+ concepts ('peer-reviewed journals', 'international conferences', 'prestigious fellowship') were correctly rephrased using A2 vocabulary ('important science magazines', 'big meetings in different countries', 'important award'). Sentence structure is appropriately simple, with complex sentences from the original text correctly broken down into multiple, short, declarative statements. No deviations were found.",
