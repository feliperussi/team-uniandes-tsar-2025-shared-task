This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes the subject's status as a 'leading' researcher and the 'prestigious' nature of her award. Your version simplifies this to 'very good at her job' and 'a very important prize', which dilutes the core meaning of her high level of achievement and recognition.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8933 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of replacing key factual terms. Phrases like 'Robotics and AI', 'peer-reviewed journals', and 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' were replaced with overly simple equivalents, causing a loss of lexical fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Suggestion: The text must be rewritten to better convey the concepts of 'leading' and 'prestigious' using A2-compliant vocabulary. The goal is simplification, not the complete removal of core concepts. Restore more specific terminology where possible to meet the fidelity requirement.",

The simplification has lost the original text's emphasis on professional prestige and academic importance.\n\n- Deviation: The core meaning of 'leading researcher' and 'prestigious... fellowship' is not fully captured by 'top researcher' and 'very special prize'. This dilution of meaning is the primary cause of the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Deviation: The sentence 'AI means making computers think like people' was added. It was not in the original text and dilutes the focus on the subject's achievements.\n- Deviation: Vocabulary violation. The added sentence introduces the B2-level words 'means' and 'making'. All vocabulary must be A2 or below.\n- Deviation: The proper name 'Royal Academy' introduces B1 ('royal') and C1 ('academy') vocabulary. While necessary for factual accuracy, this is a deviation from the A2 word list.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the sentence 'AI means making computers think like people.' It is factually extraneous and contains non-A2 vocabulary. Rephrase to better capture the original's emphasis on importance. For example, use phrases like 'a very important researcher' instead of 'top researcher'.",

MeaningBERT at 0.77 and BERTScore at 0.91 indicate successful preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classification is correct. The text is a clear and unambiguous example of this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The audit confirms strict compliance. Vocabulary is restricted to the A2 level. Complex B1+ concepts ('peer-reviewed journals', 'international conferences', 'prestigious fellowship') were correctly rephrased using A2 vocabulary ('important science magazines', 'big meetings in different countries', 'important award'). Sentence structure is appropriately simple, with complex sentences from the original text correctly broken down into multiple, short, declarative statements. No deviations were found.",
