    "text_translated": "A gene is a small part of your body with information from your parents. We have more questions about how genes change our brain and language. Did a change in a gene help us to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. It seems to be connected to speaking. It helps our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but their gene did not change in this way. It is too early to know how important genes are for language. But one day, we might find the answers in our DNA.",
