It helps our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but their gene did not change in this way. It is too early to know how important genes are for language.

The sentence 'We have more questions about how genes affect our brain and language' should have been rephrased using only A2 words. The definition of 'gene' was handled correctly, but this single vocabulary error results in failure."
