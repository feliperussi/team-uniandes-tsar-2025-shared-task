    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as B1, which is above the required A2 level. This is an instant failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'collapse' is a B2-level word. It is too advanced for an A2 audience.\n- Structural Violation: The first sentence, 'Many bridge accidents happen while people build a bridge,' uses the subordinating conjunction 'while'. This creates a complex sentence structure characteristic of B1 level, not A2.\nSuggestion: Replace 'collapse' with an A2 phrase such as 'fall down'.\nSuggestion: Split the first sentence into two simple sentences. For example: 'Many bridge accidents happen. They happen when people build a bridge.'",
