However, in recent years, newspapers and news websites around the world have been full of stories about wild animals which are coming into cities in larger numbers. For example, there have been bears in parks in Vancouver, leopards on the streets of Mumbai and wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. This makes people ask what happens when bigger animals come into our cities. Are they welcome, or do people think they are a danger or a problem?",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary B1 simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all key details from the original text preserved. The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key phrasing. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is highly effective. Replacing the passive structure 'are they considered' with the active 'do people think' is an excellent choice for B1 clarity. Furthermore, substituting 'pest' with the more common word 'problem' and clarifying 'world's press' as 'newspapers and news websites' are thoughtful improvements. The addition of cohesive devices like 'However' and 'For example' enhances the text's flow and readability. No improvements are necessary.",
