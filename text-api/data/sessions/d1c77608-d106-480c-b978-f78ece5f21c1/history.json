This makes people ask what happens when bigger animals come into our cities. Are they welcome, or do people think they are a danger or a problem?",

The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that both the core message and key phrasing were successfully retained. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The qualitative analysis is also strong: the use of connectors like 'However' and 'For example' creates excellent flow and cohesion. Vocabulary simplification is outstanding, with effective replacements such as 'world's press' becoming 'newspapers and news websites' and 'pest' becoming 'problem'. This is a model submission.",

The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of meaning and key phrasing. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The simplification strategy is highly effective. Replacing the passive structure 'are they considered' with the active 'do people think' is an excellent choice for B1 clarity. Furthermore, substituting 'pest' with the more common word 'problem' and clarifying 'world's press' as 'newspapers and news websites' are thoughtful improvements. The addition of cohesive devices like 'However' and 'For example' enhances the text's flow and readability. No improvements are necessary.",
