The sentence 'These large families had even more children who grew up and had their own families' (16 words) and 'Now, the global average number of babies for each woman has gone down from six to only two' (19 words) are too long. Sentences must not exceed approximately 15 words. The grammatical structure 'Contraception, which are methods...' is awkward for a B1 level; 'Contraception is the use of methods...' is a simpler, clearer construction."
