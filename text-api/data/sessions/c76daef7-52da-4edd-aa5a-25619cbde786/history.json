The original text states Wasfia \"reluctantly stood by and watched.\" Your version simplifies this to \"Wasfia watched.

The original text states Wasfia's reason was \"to empower women and girls.\" Your version simplifies this to \"She wants to help women and girls.\" The term \"empower\" implies giving power, agency, and confidence, which is a much stronger and more specific concept than simply \"help.\" This weakens the core message of Wasfia's mission.

The core message regarding Wasfia's motivation and the specific concept of 'empowerment' has been significantly diluted. The original text clearly states, 'Her reason for doing so: to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your output, 'She did this to help women and girls be strong. In her country, people tell them not to do sport,' fails to convey the direct causal link and replaces 'empower' with the less precise 'help...be strong'. This is a critical loss of the original meaning. Furthermore, the original 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched' conveys a specific emotional state. Your simplification 'Wasfia watched. She wanted to play. But she could not.' omits the 'reluctantly' aspect, which diminishes the initial context of her desire and societal pressure. Suggestion: Restore the explicit causal link for Wasfia's actions. Use A2 vocabulary to convey the concept of 'empowerment' and the direct challenge to societal discouragement. For example, 'She did this to make women and girls feel strong and able to do sports, because in her country, people often say they should not.'",

This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance, despite lexical fidelity. The simplification process has fragmented the narrative and weakened the cause-and-effect relationships present in the original. Specific deviations include: The original text clearly links Wasfia's inability to play with the societal belief ('reluctantly stood by and watched, as in her country it was believed that girls should not play...'). Your version separates these ideas ('Wasfia watched sadly. She wanted to play. But she could not. People in her country thought girls must not play...'), diluting the direct causal link and the specific nature of the societal constraint. The powerful and concise statement of purpose in the original, 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport', is broken into weaker, less impactful sentences in your version ('She did this to make women and girls feel strong. She wanted them to feel able to do sports. In her country, people often say girls should not do sport.'). This fragmentation diminishes the strength of the message regarding empowerment and the direct challenge to societal norms. While 'Seven Summits' might be a B1 term, its simplification to 'seven very high mountains' loses the specific, recognized achievement and the extraordinary nature of her feat, which is a key part of the original's message. Suggestion: Reconstruct sentences to maintain stronger causal links and narrative flow. Combine related ideas to preserve the impact of the original's purpose. For example, 'Wasfia could not play because people in her country believed girls must not play with hula hoops or ride bikes.' and 'She did this to make women and girls strong in her country, where people often say girls should not do sport.'.",

The simplification has resulted in a loss of critical nuance and the core message of the original text. The text is too simplistic, losing the impact and specific details that convey the original meaning. Specific deviations are listed below. \n\n- The phrase 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched' was simplified to 'Wasfia watched. She wanted to play. But she could not.' This loses the nuance of 'reluctantly' and the passive observation due to societal pressure, replacing it with a more direct, personal desire and inability. \n- The specific achievement 'climbed the Seven Summits' was generalized to 'climbed seven of the world's highest mountains'. This dilutes the specific, recognized accomplishment mentioned in the original text. \n- The core motivation 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' was simplified to 'to make women and girls strong in her country, where people often say girls should not do sport.' The word 'empower' carries a stronger meaning of agency and social change than 'make strong'. Furthermore, 'discourages them from doing sport' implies a more active, systemic barrier, which is weakened by 'people often say girls should not do sport'. This significantly diminishes the original message about challenging societal norms. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific achievement of 'Seven Summits'. Rephrase to convey the concept of 'empowerment' and the active nature of societal discouragement, even if using simpler vocabulary. Do not oversimplify to the point of losing the original intent and impact.",

The core message and nuances of the original text have been diluted, leading to a loss of fidelity in meaning. Specific deviations include: The original text states Wasfia 'reluctantly stood by and watched' due to societal beliefs. Your version simplifies this to 'Wasfia watched. She wanted to play.

The original text states Wasfia's reason was 'to empower women and girls'. Your version simplifies this to 'to help women and girls. Wasfia wants girls to feel strong and brave.' The concept of 'empowerment' (giving power or authority) is a stronger, more specific meaning than simply 'helping' or making someone 'feel strong and brave'. The original text mentions a country 'which discourages them from doing sport'. Your version simplifies this to 'people do not want girls to do sport.' 'Discourages' implies active societal or cultural pressure, whereas 'do not want' is a weaker, more passive statement of preference. Suggestion: Rephrase the initial watching scene to better convey Wasfia's internal conflict and the societal pressure. Suggestion: Strengthen the language around Wasfia's motivation to more accurately reflect 'empowerment' without using the B1 word itself. For example, 'Wasfia wants girls to have the power to choose sport' or 'Wasfia wants girls to be free to do sport'. Suggestion: Convey the active nature of the discouragement. Instead of 'people do not want', consider 'people tell girls not to do sport' or 'it is hard for girls to do sport because of what people think'.",

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and nuances of the original text. The primary issues are:\n- The original text states Wasfia 'reluctantly stood by and watched'. Your version simplifies this to 'Wasfia watched. She felt sad. She wanted to play.' This loses the nuance of 'reluctantly', which implies a deeper internal conflict and societal pressure, not just personal sadness or desire.\n- The original's concise statement of purpose, 'Her reason for doing so: to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport,' is diluted. Your version, 'She did this to give power to women and girls. In her country, people tell girls not to do sport. She wants girls to be free to do sport,' adds an interpretive sentence ('She wants girls to be free to do sport') that shifts the focus from the direct, active purpose of empowerment to a subjective desire. This weakens the direct link between her actions and the specific reason stated in the original.\nSuggestion: Rephrase the initial watching scene to better capture the 'reluctantly' aspect, perhaps by stating she could not play because of beliefs. Rephrase the purpose to directly reflect the original's active empowerment, avoiding additional interpretive statements about her desires.",

Loss of Nuance in Initial Scene: The original text states 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched, as in her country it was believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes.' Your version 'Wasfia watched. She could not play. In her country, people believed girls should not play with hula hoops. They also believed girls should not ride bikes.' removes the crucial detail of 'reluctantly' and separates the societal belief from the direct reason for her inability to play, weakening the emotional and contextual meaning.\n2.

Your version 'She did this to give power to women and girls. In her country, people tell girls not to do sport.' dilutes the direct causal connection ('Her reason for doing so') and replaces the active, systemic 'discourages them' with the more passive 'people tell girls not to do sport'. The term 'empower' is also simplified to 'give power to', which slightly diminishes its specific meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to ensure that Wasfia's initial reluctance and the direct societal reasons for her not playing are clearly linked.

The text also failed the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8998, which is below the required 0.90. The extensive rephrasing and simplification, while aiming for A2, resulted in a loss of the original text's core nuances and lexical detail. Deviations are as follows: The MeaningBERT score indicates a significant loss of the original message's depth. For instance, the nuance of 'reluctantly stood by' is lost, replaced by a simpler 'wanted to play. But she knew girls in her country should not. So she just watched.' The concise and impactful statement 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' is broken into multiple sentences ('She wanted to make them strong. In her country, people do not want girls to do sport. She wanted to show them they can do sport.'), which, while explaining, dilutes the direct meaning and impact. The BERTScore is below the threshold due to the replacement or omission of key lexical items. Words and phrases such as 'first came across,' 'visiting her native Bangladesh,' 'reluctantly stood by,' 'one of the few people,' 'empower,' and 'discourages' were either omitted or rephrased too extensively. For example, 'empower' was replaced by 'make them strong' and 'show them they can do sport,' which are semantically related but not lexically equivalent, contributing to the lower score. The addition of a definition for 'hula hoop' ('A hula hoop is a big ring. You move it around your body.') is not present in the original text. While potentially helpful for A2, it introduces new information and deviates from the original's content, impacting fidelity metrics. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the nuance of 'reluctantly stood by.' Ensure that key concepts like 'empower' and 'discourages' are conveyed with closer lexical or structural fidelity, even if simplified. Avoid adding information not present in the original text unless explicitly requested or absolutely necessary for A2 comprehension without losing fidelity.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.627 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The core message of Wasfia's motivation has been significantly diluted. The original text states her reason for hula-hooping on peaks was 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your version simplifies this to 'She wanted to show them they can be strong.' This simplification loses the specific concept of 'empowerment' and the direct link to challenging societal discouragement of sport for girls. While related, 'showing strength' is not as precise or impactful as 'empowering' against a specific cultural barrier. The BERTScore of 0.9071 is acceptable, indicating lexical fidelity, but the deeper meaning was not maintained. Deviation: The nuanced motivation of 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport' was not fully preserved. Suggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to more accurately reflect the concept of empowerment and the specific challenge of discouragement from sport. Consider using simpler words to convey 'empower' or explicitly stating that she wanted to give them power or confidence to do sport, despite what others say.",

The core meaning and nuance of the original text have been lost or altered. Specifically, the original text states 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched'. The word 'reluctantly' conveys a crucial emotional state of resistance or sadness regarding her inability to participate due to societal beliefs. Your version, 'Wasfia wanted to play with it. But she did not. So Wasfia only watched,' shifts the emphasis from her reluctance to merely observe to an inferred desire to play and subsequent inaction. This rephrasing loses the specific emotional depth and the internal conflict implied by 'reluctantly'. The output describes actions but fails to capture the original's subtle yet important emotional context. Suggestion: Rephrase the section to accurately convey Wasfia's reluctance to simply watch, rather than inferring a desire to play.",
