    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6284 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core meaning and nuance of the original text have been lost or altered. Specifically, the original text states 'Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched'. The word 'reluctantly' conveys a crucial emotional state of resistance or sadness regarding her inability to participate due to societal beliefs. Your version, 'Wasfia wanted to play with it. But she did not. So Wasfia only watched,' shifts the emphasis from her reluctance to merely observe to an inferred desire to play and subsequent inaction. This rephrasing loses the specific emotional depth and the internal conflict implied by 'reluctantly'. The output describes actions but fails to capture the original's subtle yet important emotional context. Suggestion: Rephrase the section to accurately convey Wasfia's reluctance to simply watch, rather than inferring a desire to play.",
