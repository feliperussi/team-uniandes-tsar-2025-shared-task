        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, falling significantly below the required thresholds for both MeaningBERT and BERTScore. This is a critical failure in content preservation.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5574 is well below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a nuanced message about the dual nature of cultural awareness (helpful but dangerous if it leads to stereotypes) and the multifaceted influences on individual behavior beyond national culture. Your version loses this depth, presenting a more simplistic 'stereotypes are bad' message without fully capturing the original's complexity regarding the *use* of knowledge about differences. For example, the original's 'rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' is simplified to 'But we must not use them to judge all people from a country. Every person is different,' which loses the specific nuance of 'pigeonhole' and the direct link to 'entire nation' in the context of business relationships.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8616 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of lexical detail and specific phrasing from the original. Many key terms and phrases were not adequately preserved or were overly simplified, leading to a reduction in the fidelity of the content. For instance, 'increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour' becomes 'good to know about different things. People from different places can think and act in different ways.' 'Detrimental to building good business relationships' becomes 'stop us from making good work friends.' 'Pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' becomes 'judge all people from a country.' These simplifications, while aiming for A2, sacrifice too much of the original's specific vocabulary and phrasing.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- The text must retain more of the original's core message about the balance between useful awareness and harmful stereotyping. The nuance of *how* to use knowledge about differences must be preserved.\n- Key concepts such as 'miscommunication,' 'detrimental,' 'business relationships,' 'national cultures,' 'corporate culture,' and 'individual experiences' need to be conveyed, even if simplified, without losing their essential meaning.\n- Rephrase sentences to ensure that the A2 vocabulary still accurately reflects the original concepts, rather than oversimplifying them to the point of meaning loss. Focus on finding A2 equivalents that maintain fidelity.",

The original's 'keep at the back of our minds' is weakened to 'remember them a little'.

The core message of the original text, which emphasizes the nuanced and dual nature of cultural awareness (helpful for avoiding miscommunication but dangerous if it leads to stereotypes), has been lost in the simplification. The writer's output presents these ideas more disjointedly, weakening the critical connection and the 'vital' warning present in the original. The original's emphasis on 'rather than something that we use to pigeonhole' as a direct instruction on the *misuse* of knowledge is also diluted. The 'therefore' in the original, indicating a logical consequence, is missing, further weakening the overall message coherence. \n\nAdditional Deviations:\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8788 is below the required 0.90. Key lexical details from the original text were not sufficiently preserved. For example, 'miscommunication' was simplified to 'problems when we talk to people', and 'detrimental' to 'bad', losing some of the precise meaning. 'Business relationships' was simplified to 'work relationships'. 'National cultures' became 'People from one country'. 'Corporate culture' became 'Our company's way of working'. 'Individual experiences of the world' became 'What happens to us in life also changes us'. While these are simplifications, they collectively reduce the lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier rated the text as 'A2', which is the target. However, the simplification was too aggressive, leading to the meaning preservation failure.\n- Vocabulary Audit: The word 'certain' is listed as A2, but its repeated use ('act in a certain way', 'think in a certain way') can sometimes imply a B1 nuance depending on context. While acceptable here, it borders on the upper limit of A2 usage for such a concept. The phrase 'put all people from a country into one small box' is an effective A2 simplification for 'pigeonhole', but the overall simplification strategy led to the meaning loss.",

Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6088 is significantly below the required 0.75. The nuanced message of the original text, particularly regarding the 'increased awareness' and the 'vital' importance of avoiding stereotypes, has been diluted. For example, 'increased awareness' was reduced to 'good to know', losing the emphasis on active development of understanding. The sophisticated caution against 'pigeonholing' was simplified to 'think all people from one country are the same', which, while simpler, loses some of the original's specific intent.  Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8808 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific examples include the replacement of 'miscommunication' with 'problems when we talk', 'detrimental' with 'bad ideas' and 'hurt', 'shaping' with 'make', 'largely influenced by' with 'make us who we are', and 'pigeonhole' with 'think all people from one country are the same'. While these are simplifications, they result in insufficient lexical overlap with the original.  CEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR_Classifier_Result rated the text as 'B1', not the required 'A2'. Despite the use of short sentences, the overall complexity of the concepts presented, such as the detailed list of influencing factors (region, communities, age, gender, corporate culture, individual experiences) and the nuanced instruction about not generalizing, pushes the text beyond a strict A2 level.  Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the emphasis on 'increased awareness' and the 'vital' nature of the message. Ensure key terms like 'miscommunication' or 'detrimental' are simplified in a way that retains more lexical connection to the original, or find A2 synonyms that are closer in meaning.

The text fails to accurately convey the core message and key details of the original text, resulting in a significant loss of information. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5385 is well below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial deviation in meaning. The BERTScore of 0.8736 is below the required 0.90, showing a loss of critical lexical content. The simplification was too aggressive, sacrificing the original's nuanced message for brevity. Specific deviations include: 1. The original's emphasis on 'increased awareness' and 'avoid cases of miscommunication' is diluted to 'It is good to know about differences. This helps us stop problems when we talk. It helps us understand each other better.' This loses the specific concept of 'miscommunication' and the proactive nature of 'increased awareness'. 2. The phrase 'detrimental to building good business relationships' is simplified to 'bad for good business relationships. They can make it hard to work well with people.' While conveying negativity, it loses the specific, stronger term 'detrimental'. 3. The original states 'national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by...' The writer's output 'A country's culture can change how we act. It can change how we think. But many other things also change us.' loses the nuance of 'play a part' and 'largely influenced by', making the statement less precise. 4. The critical concept of 'keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' is oversimplified to 'We should keep this knowledge in our minds. But we must not use it to put all people from one country in a box. We must not think all people from one country are the same. Every person is different.' This loses the specific, more sophisticated meaning of 'pigeonhole' and the idea of 'individuals of an entire nation'. The core message about *how* to apply the knowledge (as background awareness, not rigid classification) is significantly weakened. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific meaning of 'miscommunication', 'detrimental', 'play a part in shaping', 'largely influenced by', and the nuanced instruction regarding 'pigeonholing' while using A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. Do not sacrifice meaning for simplicity.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5836 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8813 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key lexical items and factual phrasing. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR Compliance Check, as the classifier rated it B1, not A2. Detected deviations are as follows: MeaningBERT failure: The original text emphasizes the delicate balance between awareness of differences and the vital need to avoid detrimental stereotypes. Your version separates these ideas and adds 'Stereotypes are not always true', which, while a factual statement, shifts the original's focus on the negative impact on business relationships. The nuance of 'increased awareness' versus 'vital to remember' is lost. MeaningBERT failure: The original's 'keep at the back of our minds' implies a subtle, guiding awareness. Your 'keep this knowledge in our minds' is less nuanced. The addition of 'Every person is different' is not present in the original and alters the emphasis from avoiding 'pigeonholing' to a general statement about individuality. BERTScore failure: Key terms and phrases from the original were lost or significantly altered. Examples include 'detrimental' replaced by 'very bad', 'building good business relationships' simplified to 'stop good business relationships', 'largely influenced' reduced to 'affect us a lot', 'region we come from' to 'place we live', 'communities we associate with' to 'groups we are with', 'individual experiences of the world' to 'what happens to us in life', and 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' to 'put all people from one country into one group'. These changes result in a loss of lexical precision and detail. CEFR Compliance failure: The classifier rated the text as B1. This is primarily due to the use of the word 'means' in the sentence 'Miscommunication means we do not understand each other.', which is classified as a B2 vocabulary item. Corrective Path: Re-evaluate the core message to ensure the balance between awareness and the danger of stereotypes is maintained, not just stated as separate facts. Restore the nuance of 'at the back of our minds' to convey a subtle, guiding awareness rather than general knowledge. Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary where possible, such as 'detrimental' (or an A2 equivalent that conveys strong negative impact), 'building relationships', and the concept of 'pigeonholing' without losing the A2 target. Replace the word 'means' with an A2 equivalent such as 'is' or 'is when'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8831 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing from the source text.
