    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, as evidenced by the provided metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6111 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's nuance and emphasis. The BERTScore of 0.8831 is also below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing from the source text. The simplification was too aggressive, leading to a diluted message and a loss of important lexical detail. For example, the original's 'Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication' was reduced to 'We can know about differences. People expect different things. People act in different ways. This helps us avoid miscommunication.' This loses the concept of 'increased awareness' and the more formal phrasing. Similarly, 'detrimental to building good business relationships' was simplified to 'very bad for business. They hurt good business relationships.', which, while conveying the basic idea, loses the specific lexical precision of 'detrimental' and 'building'. The phrase 'largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world' was broken down into many short, less connected sentences, losing the original's cohesive list and the specific phrasing of 'largely influenced' and 'individual experiences of the world'. The final sentence's 'something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' was simplified to 'So, it is good to know about differences. We should remember them. But we must not use this knowledge to put all people from one country into one group.' This loses the idiomatic expression 'keep at the back of our minds' and the specific verb 'pigeonhole', replacing it with a more generic description. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary and phrasing while still simplifying grammar. Ensure that the emphasis and nuance of the original message are preserved. Use more direct A2 synonyms for complex words that maintain the original's specific meaning, rather than breaking them into multiple, less precise sentences.",
