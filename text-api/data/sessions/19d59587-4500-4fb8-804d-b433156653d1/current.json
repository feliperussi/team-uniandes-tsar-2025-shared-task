    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards and accurately conveys the original meaning. The factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8646) and BERTScore (0.9022) are well within the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is appropriate for A2, with complex terms like 'peer-reviewed' and 'fellowship' effectively simplified into A2-level explanations ('Other researchers read and check her papers' and 'This award helps her do important work'). Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, avoiding complex clauses or connectors beyond basic conjunctions. This is an exemplary A2 simplification.",
