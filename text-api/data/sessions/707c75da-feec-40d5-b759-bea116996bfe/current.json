    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets all A2 requirements with precision. Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers, and the core message from the original text are preserved without error. Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8342 and BERTScore of 0.9079 are above the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of meaning and key terms. CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2. Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The B2 word 'potentially' was correctly identified and removed. Structural Simplicity: The text consists entirely of short, simple sentences. The use of basic connectors like 'but' and 'if' is appropriate for the A2 level. No complex clauses were used. The output is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",
