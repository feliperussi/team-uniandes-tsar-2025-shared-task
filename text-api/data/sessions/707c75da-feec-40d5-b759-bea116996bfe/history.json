This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text provides a specific definition for 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' as rocks passing 'within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit'. Your output simplifies this to 'Some dangerous asteroids come near the Earth'. This simplification is too extreme; it removes the specific data and the key concept of 'orbit', which are central to the original text's meaning.\n- Consequence: While the text is grammatically simple and uses A2 vocabulary, it has sacrificed essential information to achieve this simplicity. The BERTScore of 0.9001 is barely passing, further showing that key lexical items were lost.\n\nSuggestion: You must reintroduce the core definitional concept without using B1 language. Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. Example: 'Some dangerous asteroids are rocks that travel very close to the Earth's path in space.' This is more accurate than 'come near the Earth' and better preserves the original meaning.",

Your version, 'the Earth's path in space', is a vague simplification that degrades the scientific meaning.\n- The original mentions 'two defence solutions could be launched'.

All numbers and core concepts are preserved.\n- Metrics Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.83 and BERTScore of 0.90 meet the required thresholds, indicating successful preservation of meaning and key terms.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful command of A2 constraints. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. Sentence structures are simple, short, and clear. Complex ideas from the original, such as 'at which point two defence solutions could be launched', are perfectly rephrased into A2-compliant structures like 'If there is a problem, NASA has two plans to stop it.'
