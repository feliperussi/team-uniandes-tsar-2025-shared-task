According to NASA, Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls with the seasons. It is almost like the planet is breathing it.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2' instead of the target 'B1'. While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning very well, it is too simple. The original complex sentences were broken down into too many short, simple sentences, creating a choppy text that lacks the sentence variety expected at the B1 level. For example, the sentences 'The level of methane rises and falls with the seasons. It is almost like the planet is breathing it.' could be combined into a single, more fluent B1 sentence: 'The level of methane rises and falls with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing it.' To reach the B1 target, focus on combining some of the simpler sentences using B1 connectors like 'so', 'because', or 'which' to improve flow and structural complexity.",
