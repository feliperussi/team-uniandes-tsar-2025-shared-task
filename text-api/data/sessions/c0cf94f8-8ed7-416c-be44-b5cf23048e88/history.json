While the simplification successfully preserved facts and meaning, as indicated by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores, it was too aggressive in its simplification. The primary issue is the consistent replacement of original vocabulary with A1/A2 level words instead of B1 alternatives. For example, 'analyses' was changed to 'checks' (A1) and 'periodically' became 'from time to time' (A1 phrase). A B1-level simplification might use 'studies' or 'regularly'. Additionally, the text consists of a series of short, simple sentences, resulting in a choppy flow that is characteristic of an A2 level. To improve, combine some sentences to create more complex structures and use appropriate B1 vocabulary to meet the target CEFR level.",
