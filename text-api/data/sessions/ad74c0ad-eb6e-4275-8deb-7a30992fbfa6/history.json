No information was lost or distorted.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8837 and BERTScore of 0.9168 are well above the required thresholds of 0.75 and 0.90, respectively. This confirms the core message and key lexical items were preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms this.\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Simplifications such as 'performing' to 'working well' and 'vague' to 'not clear' are exemplary.\n- Structure: The text uses short, simple sentences. The use of the connector 'so' is appropriate for A2. The sentence structures are clean and meet the required standard without deviation.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8837 and BERTScore of 0.9168 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Excellent. B1/B2 vocabulary such as 'frustration', 'collaborate', and 'satisfactorily' was correctly replaced with A2 equivalents like 'unhappy', 'work better with', and 'helping...well'. The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level.\n- Structural Simplification: Correctly executed. Complex sentences were deconstructed into short, simple clauses appropriate for the A2 level. Use of connectors is minimal and correct.",
