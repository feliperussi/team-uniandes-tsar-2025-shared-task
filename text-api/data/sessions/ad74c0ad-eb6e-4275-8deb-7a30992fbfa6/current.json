    "feedback": "PASS. The output meets all A2 compliance standards.\n- Factual Integrity: Maintained. No discrepancies were found between the original and the simplified text.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are within acceptable ranges. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8837 and BERTScore of 0.9168 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Excellent. B1/B2 vocabulary such as 'frustration', 'collaborate', and 'satisfactorily' was correctly replaced with A2 equivalents like 'unhappy', 'work better with', and 'helping...well'. The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level.\n- Structural Simplification: Correctly executed. Complex sentences were deconstructed into short, simple clauses appropriate for the A2 level. Use of connectors is minimal and correct.",
