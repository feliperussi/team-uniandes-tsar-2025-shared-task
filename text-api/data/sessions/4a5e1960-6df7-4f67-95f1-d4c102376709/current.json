    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key phrasing. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The writer's strategy of breaking down the original's complex sentences into shorter, clearer statements is highly effective. For example, splitting the final sentence into two ideas ('However, the exact meaning may differ. To understand...') significantly improves readability. Furthermore, the addition of clarifying sentences like 'They often reflect hidden concerns' is a sophisticated technique that unpacks the abstract concept of 'insights' for a B1 audience without altering the core meaning. The vocabulary choices are precise and appropriate for the target level. This is a model simplification.",
