While the simplification successfully passed the critical Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores (MeaningBERT: 0.90, BERTScore: 0.93), the final output is linguistically too simple. The sentence structures are clear but lack the complexity expected at a B1 level. For example, the sentence 'The important part is to understand what each dream means for you...' uses a very direct and simple structure. To reach B1, consider introducing more complex clauses or connectors. For instance, rephrasing to 'In order to understand what a dream means for you, it is necessary to connect it to the events and feelings in your daily life' would introduce a clause of purpose, which is a common B1 feature.",

The output uses B2-level vocabulary such as 'insight' and 'interpretation', which should have been replaced. Furthermore, the sentence structures are too advanced for a B1 level. For example, the first sentence is a long compound-complex sentence, and the second sentence uses the subordinating conjunction 'although'. Suggestion: Split the first sentence into two simpler sentences. Rephrase the second sentence to avoid 'although', for instance by using 'However' to start a new sentence. Replace 'insight' with 'understanding' and 'interpretation' with 'meaning'.",

The MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key phrasing. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The writer's strategy of breaking down the original's complex sentences into shorter, clearer statements is highly effective. For example, splitting the final sentence into two ideas ('However, the exact meaning may differ. To understand...') significantly improves readability. Furthermore, the addition of clarifying sentences like 'They often reflect hidden concerns' is a sophisticated technique that unpacks the abstract concept of 'insights' for a B1 audience without altering the core meaning. The vocabulary choices are precise and appropriate for the target level. This is a model simplification.",
