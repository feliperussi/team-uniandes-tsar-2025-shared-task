This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The text also fails the Factual Integrity Check.\n\n- Factual Inaccuracy: The original text lists 'insects' as a common small animal. Your version omits this fact entirely. All factual details must be preserved.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The low MeaningBERT score is a direct result of oversimplification. The phrase 'the world's press has been full of reports' implies a global and significant media event. Your version, 'Newspapers and TV have many stories about this', reduces the scale and impact of the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the missing fact about 'insects'. Rephrase the sentence about media reports to better capture the global scope. Example: 'Newspapers around the world have many stories about this.'",

All examples and core messages are preserved without error.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT score of 0.80 and BERTScore of 0.93 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classifier result is correct. The text is a model of A2-level writing.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'pest' to 'problem' is an exemplary adaptation. Sentence structure is consistently simple, using short sentences and basic connectors appropriate for the A2 level. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
