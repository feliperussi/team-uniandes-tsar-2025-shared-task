    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All examples and core messages are preserved without error.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT score of 0.80 and BERTScore of 0.93 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity.\n- CEFR Classification: The A2 classifier result is correct. The text is a model of A2-level writing.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'pest' to 'problem' is an exemplary adaptation. Sentence structure is consistently simple, using short sentences and basic connectors appropriate for the A2 level. No deviations from the standard were detected.",
