    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6262 is well below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.8688 is also below the 0.90 threshold, showing that key factual words were removed.\n- The simplification is too aggressive. The original's concept of a 'mystery' that requires a 'complete investigation' is lost when simplified to 'big questions' and 'study'. This changes the core meaning from a complex engineering problem to a simple question.\n- Key vocabulary was oversimplified, causing the low scores. 'Inferior-quality material' was reduced to 'weak', and 'defect' was reduced to 'problem'. This loses important technical meaning.\n- The phrase 'Some bridge falls down are big questions' is grammatically incorrect. It should be 'Why some bridges fall down is a big question' or similar.\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts. Use A2-compliant phrasing that is more accurate. For example, 'Engineers do not always know why a bridge falls down' is better than 'Some bridge falls down are big questions'. The goal is simplification, not total loss of meaning.",
