Do not eliminate concepts; simplify them. Rephrase to include the idea of a formal 'study' or 'investigation'.

The plural subject 'collapses' requires a plural complement 'mysteries'.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all non-A2 words immediately. Replace 'mystery' with 'a big question'. Replace 'collapse' with 'fall down'. Replace 'defect' with 'a problem' or 'something wrong with it'. Correct the grammatical error in the first sentence.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6262 is well below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message. The BERTScore of 0.8688 is also below the 0.90 threshold, showing that key factual words were removed.\n- The simplification is too aggressive. The original's concept of a 'mystery' that requires a 'complete investigation' is lost when simplified to 'big questions' and 'study'. This changes the core meaning from a complex engineering problem to a simple question.\n- Key vocabulary was oversimplified, causing the low scores. 'Inferior-quality material' was reduced to 'weak', and 'defect' was reduced to 'problem'. This loses important technical meaning.\n- The phrase 'Some bridge falls down are big questions' is grammatically incorrect. It should be 'Why some bridges fall down is a big question' or similar.\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts. Use A2-compliant phrasing that is more accurate. For example, 'Engineers do not always know why a bridge falls down' is better than 'Some bridge falls down are big questions'. The goal is simplification, not total loss of meaning.",
