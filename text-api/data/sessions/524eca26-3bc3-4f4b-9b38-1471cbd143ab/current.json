    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8929 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, failing the Priority 2 diagnostic.\n\n- The phrase 'in the world' was removed from the first sentence. This loses important information about the scale of the projects and reduces lexical overlap with the source.\n- The term 'crucial links' was replaced with 'very important paths'. While a valid simplification, it contributes to the lower fidelity score.\n- The term 'bodies of water' was simplified to 'water', and 'mountain gorges' to 'mountain gaps'. These simplifications, while good for A2 vocabulary, cumulatively lowered the score by removing too much of the original phrasing.\n- The original's 'intense scrutiny' was simplified to 'watched very carefully'. This is an acceptable A2 simplification but also contributes to the fidelity drop.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the 0.90 BERTScore threshold, you must retain more of the original's key nouns and specific details. Re-insert the phrase 'in the world'. Rephrase to retain concepts like 'links' and 'bodies of water' in a simple A2 context.",
