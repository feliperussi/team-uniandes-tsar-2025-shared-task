This is a critical error.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error in the first sentence. Replace all words rated B1 or higher with A2 equivalents or simple definitions.

The simplification process has removed too much of the source vocabulary.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B2-level words 'means' and 'making' in the sentence 'Building work means making things like roads and bridges.' These words are not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\n- Keyword Definition Failure: The definition provided for 'civil engineering' uses the non-compliant B2 words 'means' and 'making'. All definitions must use A1 or A2 vocabulary only.\n\n- Lexical Loss: Key concepts were over-simplified, contributing to the low BERTScore. 'Crucial links' became 'important paths', 'intense scrutiny' became 'checked a lot', and 'collapse' became 'fall down'. This level of simplification damages fidelity to the source.\n\nSuggestion: Restore more precise A2-level vocabulary to meet the BERTScore requirement. Replace 'checked a lot' with a phrase like 'are watched very carefully'. Remove the B2 words 'means' and 'making'. Redefine 'civil engineering' using only A1/A2 words. For example: 'Civil engineering is the work of building big things like roads and bridges.'",

This indicates a loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, failing the Priority 2 diagnostic.\n\n- The phrase 'in the world' was removed from the first sentence. This loses important information about the scale of the projects and reduces lexical overlap with the source.\n- The term 'crucial links' was replaced with 'very important paths'. While a valid simplification, it contributes to the lower fidelity score.\n- The term 'bodies of water' was simplified to 'water', and 'mountain gorges' to 'mountain gaps'. These simplifications, while good for A2 vocabulary, cumulatively lowered the score by removing too much of the original phrasing.\n- The original's 'intense scrutiny' was simplified to 'watched very carefully'. This is an acceptable A2 simplification but also contributes to the fidelity drop.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the 0.90 BERTScore threshold, you must retain more of the original's key nouns and specific details.
