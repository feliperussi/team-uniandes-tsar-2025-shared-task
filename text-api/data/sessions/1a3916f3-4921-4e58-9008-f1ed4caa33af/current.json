    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6322 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8901 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key factual phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text specifies consequences like 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies this to 'think bad things about people' and 'difficult to work together'. This is too generic and loses the specific business context.\n- Lexical Loss: Key phrases from the original, such as 'cultural norms and practices' and 'global business community', were completely removed. This contributes to the low BERTScore and a loss of fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance Irrelevant: While the text correctly registers as A2 in structure and vocabulary, this is meaningless because the primary task of preserving the original meaning has failed.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text. You must restore the specific concepts that were lost. Rephrase to include the idea of 'judging people wrongly' instead of 'thinking bad things'. Rephrase to include the idea that 'communication can stop or fail' instead of just being 'difficult'. You must find A2-level ways to express these more precise concepts from the original text.",
