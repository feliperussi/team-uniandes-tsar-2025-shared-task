    "text_translated": "Culture is the way people in a country or group live. It is their ideas and their way of doing things. A stereotype is a simple idea about a group of people. This idea is often not true. It is good to know that people can have different ideas and act in different ways. This helps us understand each other better. But it is very important to remember that stereotypes are bad. They are not good for working well with people in business. A country's culture can change how we think and act. But many other things also change us. For example, our home town is important. The people around us are important. How old we are is important. If we are a man or a woman is also important. Our job is important. The things in our life are also important. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we should not think that all people from one country are the same.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 simplification. It correctly defines the key terms 'culture' and 'stereotype' at the beginning. Sentence structure is consistently simple and declarative. Vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. The complex ideas from the original text, such as the various influences on behavior and the danger of pigeonholing, are broken down into easily understandable concepts without losing factual accuracy. This is an exemplary execution of the task.",
