    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6644 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The simplification has removed essential context from the original text, resulting in a loss of the core message.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text specifies that people owe money \"to credit card companies.\" Your version, \"Each adult in Britain must pay back about \u00a3670,\" removes this crucial detail. This severs the direct link between using credit cards and the resulting debt, which is a central point of the original text.\n\n- Vague Simplification: The original identifies the environmental problem with the specific term \"landfill sites.\" Your replacement, \"big places for rubbish,\" is too vague and fails to convey the specific environmental impact of burying waste. This simplification loses the intended meaning.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The sentence about debt must explicitly mention credit card companies. The sentence about waste must be rephrased to better explain what a landfill is in simple terms, for example, \"Most of these clothes go into the ground in special places for rubbish.\"",
