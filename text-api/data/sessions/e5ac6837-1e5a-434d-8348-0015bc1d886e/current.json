    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all checks. It maintains factual integrity, preserves the original meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.7974, BERTScore: 0.9113), and correctly classifies as A2.\n\n- Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. All words used are appropriate for the target audience.\n- Sentence Structure: The use of short, simple sentences is correct for the A2 standard. This ensures high readability.\n- Grammar: A minor grammatical error was detected. The sentence 'My boss and I agreed that I will work three days a week' uses an incorrect tense. The past tense 'agreed' should be followed by 'would work' to maintain tense consistency.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the tense in the sentence 'My boss and I agreed that I will work...' to '...that I would work...' for grammatical accuracy.",
