This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states that engineers build on areas that are 'much more resistant to movement'. Your output, 'These places do not move so much', is a severe oversimplification. It changes the meaning from a property of the ground (resistance) to a simple observation of outcome (less movement). This semantic shift is unacceptable and is the direct cause of the metric failure.\n\n- Suggestion: The concept of 'resistance' must be preserved. Rephrase the final sentences to capture this meaning. Example: 'Engineers build bridges on ground that is stronger. This ground does not move easily when there is an earthquake.'"

MeaningBERT at 0.796 and BERTScore at 0.9061 confirm that the core message and key terms of the original text were preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text demonstrates excellent control of A2-level grammar and vocabulary.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1/A2 level. The single identified B1 keyword, 'earthquake', was correctly defined in the first sentence using simple A2 terms. Sentence structures are simple, using appropriate A2-level clauses ('when', 'where', 'that') without becoming complex."
