This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The concept of 'empowerment' was lost. The original states the goal was 'to empower women and girls'. Your version, 'to help women and girls in her country feel strong', is a weaker statement that does not carry the same meaning of giving power and agency. This semantic dilution is the main cause of the metric failure.\n- Secondary Deviation: The verb tense was altered incorrectly. The original text uses a present perfect construction ('is one of the few people... to have climbed'), indicating a current status or achievement. Your use of the simple past 'climbed' changes the meaning to a completed action in the past, which is a factual alteration of the context set by the word 'Now'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase the final sentence to capture the idea of giving power. Example: 'She did this to show women and girls they can be powerful'. Correct the verb tense to reflect a current achievement. Example: 'Now, Wasfia has climbed the seven highest mountains...'"

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's concept of 'empower' was not successfully translated to A2. Your phrase 'show... that they can be powerful' loses the core meaning of giving agency and strength. The original's 'reluctantly' was changed to 'sad', which is a different emotion and contributes to the meaning deviation.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'powerful', which is a B1-level word. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n- Structural Complexity: The final sentence, 'She did this to show women and girls in her country that they can be powerful, because her country tells them not to do sport,' is structurally too complex for A2. It combines a 'that-clause' with a 'because' clause, creating a B1-level sentence structure.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the concept of 'empowerment' using simpler A2 terms like 'to help women feel strong'. Remove the B1 word 'powerful'. Split the final sentence into two separate, simple sentences. Example: 'She did this for the women and girls in her country. She wanted to show them they can be strong.'"

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The primary failure is the weakening of the central theme. The original states Wasfia's reason is 'to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport.' Your version, 'She wanted to give women and girls in her country more power. In her country, many people say girls should not do sport,' is a much weaker statement. The concept of active 'discouragement' is lost.\n\n- The emotional nuance of 'reluctantly stood by and watched' has been completely removed. Your version, 'Wasfia watched, but she could not play,' is factually correct but semantically empty. It fails to convey her internal state, which is part of the original's meaning.\n\n- While the text passes the BERTScore and CEFR classification, the loss of meaning is a non-negotiable failure at a higher priority level.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. Rephrase to show a stronger connection between the societal problem and her actions. Use language like 'She did this because she wanted to show that women and girls can be strong.' Find a better A2 alternative for 'discourages', such as 'people think it is wrong for girls to do sport'."

Your version, 'Wasfia wanted to play too, but she could not,' is factually correct but loses this important emotional nuance, contributing to the low meaning score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the final section to directly link the action and the reason. Use a simpler A2 alternative for 'empower', such as 'to help women and girls feel strong and believe in themselves'. Correct the description of her childhood experience to better reflect the meaning of 'reluctantly'."

The concept of 'empower' must be translated more directly, for example: 'to give women more power' or 'to make women stronger'.

It is semantically weak.\n\n- Meaning Deviation: The original concept 'a country which discourages them from doing sport' implies a broad, societal pressure. Your version, 'people tell girls not to do sports', reduces this complex idea to a simple action, losing the original's force and nuance.\n\n- Factual Addition: The sentence 'She wanted to show that this idea is wrong' is an interpretation added by the writer. It is not present in the original text and contributes to the meaning drift detected by the metric.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original meaning more accurately while using A2 vocabulary. Replace 'to give power' with a phrase like 'to help women and girls become strong'.

For 'empower', use a phrase like 'to help women feel strong'. For 'discourages', explain that 'it was not easy for women to do sport' or 'people thought it was not good for women to do sport'."

This changes the meaning from a general societal pressure to a direct command, which is a loss of nuance and a potential factual shift.\n- Consequence: While the text is structurally simple and factually correct on the surface, these subtle changes in meaning were significant enough to cause a failure on a primary metric.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the final sentence to capture the concept of 'empowerment'. A phrase like 'to help women and girls feel more powerful' is closer to the original intent. Correct the phrase 'tells them not to do sports' to something that reflects 'discourages', such as 'thinks it is not good for them to do sports'."

This loses the specific meaning of rarity and exclusivity, which is a key part of her achievement.\n- Structural Compliance: The text successfully uses A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures, which resulted in the correct A2 classification. However, this structural success is irrelevant due to the failure to maintain the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The core message must be preserved. Rephrase the final sentences to restore the concept of 'empowerment'. A more accurate A2 simplification would be: 'She did this to give women and girls in her country more power and opportunities.' This phrasing is active and closer to the original meaning than your version."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6494 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The simplification process has removed essential nuance.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text states Wasfia's goal is to 'empower' women and girls in a country that 'discourages' them from sport. Your version, 'help women and girls... feel strong and confident' in a country where 'people often say that sports are not for girls', is a weaker interpretation. 'Empower' implies giving power and agency; 'discourage' implies active opposition. Your phrasing loses this semantic weight, causing the metric failure.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): The text includes the B1-level word 'confident'. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below. This is a compliance violation.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to restore the original concepts of 'empowerment' and 'discouragement' using A2 vocabulary. For example, 'She wanted to give women and girls in her country more power' and 'In her country, many people stop girls from doing sport'.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove the B1 word 'confident'. Replace it with an A2 alternative or rephrase the sentence to avoid its use."
