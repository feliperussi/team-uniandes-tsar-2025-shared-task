    "text_translated": "Wasfia Nazreen was a young girl when she saw a hula hoop for the first time. A child from another country was playing with it in her country, Bangladesh. Wasfia watched the child. She wanted to play too, but she could not. In her country, people said girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia is a climber. She is one of only a few people in the world to climb the Seven Summits. These are very high mountains, like Everest and Kilimanjaro. She was the first person to hula-hoop on top of each mountain. She did this for an important reason. She wanted to give women and girls in her country more power. In her country, many people stop girls from doing sport.",
