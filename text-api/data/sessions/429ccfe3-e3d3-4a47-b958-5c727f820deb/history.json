This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Primary Error: The phrase 'in your daily life' was incorrectly shortened to 'in your daily'. This is grammatically incorrect and omits the essential noun 'life', directly causing the drop in the fidelity score.\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. While simple sentences are required for A2, this level of fragmentation makes the text choppy and unnatural.\n- Lexical Loss: The cumulative effect of simplifying phrases like 'insights into things' to 'ideas' and 'connect them to' to 'link it to' contributed to the low BERTScore.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the grammatical error by restoring the phrase 'in your daily life'. Combine the list of common dreams into a single, simple sentence to improve readability. For example: 'Common dreams are flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public.' Re-evaluate simplifications to ensure essential words are not lost.",

The primary cause of the low score is the over-simplification of the final sentence. Splitting 'connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life' into two disconnected sentences ('link it to events in your daily life. Also link it to your feelings.') was too aggressive and damaged the text's fidelity. While the vocabulary is correctly at the A2 level and the meaning is preserved (MeaningBERT score is high), the strict fidelity requirement was not met. Suggestion: Recombine the final two sentences into one. The sentence 'To understand a dream, link it to events and feelings in your daily life' is a compliant A2 structure and would have maintained a higher fidelity score.",
