        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The text fails at the most fundamental level. The original text states people 'owe' money to credit card companies, indicating debt. Your version changes this to 'pay' money, which is a completely different action and factually incorrect. This single error corrupts the core message of the source text.\n\n- Factual Error: The line 'British people now pay about \u00a3670 per person' is a direct contradiction of the original meaning of being in debt.\n- Text Corruption: The line 'They? Actually \"They use it to buy things they do not need.\"' is not a valid sentence. It is corrupted text that must be corrected.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, which is above the required A2 level. This is an automatic failure.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The words 'percent' and 'income' are B1 level. They are not suitable for an A2 text and must be replaced or rephrased.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'purchases' is B1 level and was introduced unnecessarily.\n- Lexical Inaccuracy: Changing 'credit cards' to 'bank cards' loses the specific meaning of debt associated with credit.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning of 'owe' to correctly describe debt. Rewrite the corrupted line as a complete sentence. Remove all B1 vocabulary ('percent', 'income', 'purchases'). Rephrase to explain these concepts in A2 terms. For example, 'income' can be 'the money they earn'. 'Percent' can be explained as '4 pounds for every 100 pounds they get'.",

The primary function of this assessment is to enforce strict adherence to the A2 standard, and this text does not comply. B1 Vocabulary Detected: The word 'owe' is B1 level. It appears in the sentence: 'British people now owe about \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies.' This is an instant failure. All words must be within the A2 wordlist or simplified. Suggestion: The concept of 'owe' must be rephrased using only A2 vocabulary. Replace the sentence. Use a construction like: 'British people must pay back about \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies.' The text is otherwise structurally sound, but this single vocabulary error makes it unacceptable.",
