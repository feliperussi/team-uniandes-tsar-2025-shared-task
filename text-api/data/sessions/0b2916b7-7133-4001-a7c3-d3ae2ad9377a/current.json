    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, figures, and core messages from the original text are preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.84 and BERTScore of 0.91 are well above the required thresholds, confirming high fidelity to the source material.\n- CEFR Compliance: The classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The replacement of 'landfill sites' with 'dump' and 'environment' with 'nature' is correct. The simplification of 'four per cent' to '4 pounds for each hundred pounds they earn' is a model technique for this level. Sentence structure is consistently simple and short, adhering perfectly to A2 standards.",
