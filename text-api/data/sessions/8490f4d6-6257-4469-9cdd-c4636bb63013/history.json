        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the inability to preserve the core message of the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6935 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text's emphasis on professional prestige ('leading researcher', 'highly regarded', 'prestigious') was lost in the simplification to 'very important' and 'very special'. This alters the core message from one of high professional achievement to simple importance.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The text also fails the fidelity check. The BERTScore of 0.8925 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing key lexical items from the original text, such as 'leading' and 'prestigious', with overly simple alternatives.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text violates A2 vocabulary constraints. The definition 'AI means Artificial Intelligence' introduces B2-level words ('means', 'artificial') and a B1-level word ('intelligence'). The words 'royal' (B1) and 'academy' (C1) were also used. All vocabulary must be strictly A2.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the concept of high achievement using A2 vocabulary. Rephrase 'very important researcher' to 'one of the best researchers'.\n\n- Suggestion: Define keywords without introducing vocabulary above the A2 level. Rephrase the definition of AI. Do not use the words 'means', 'artificial', or 'intelligence'. A correct A2 definition would be: 'AI helps computers learn and think like people'."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics before any qualitative analysis can be considered. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6532 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.878 is also below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The score indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message. The original text is exclusively about the accomplishments of Julie Wong. Your output begins with general definitions of 'Robotics' and 'AI'. This extraneous information dilutes the central topic and is the direct cause of the meaning preservation failure.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The score indicates a significant loss of key lexical information. Replacing specific, important proper nouns like 'Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' with a generic phrase like 'a famous group of scientists' is an over-simplification that damages factual fidelity.\n\n- Structural Error: The first two sentences are definitions. They do not belong in a text that is supposed to be a simplified version of a biography.\n\nSuggestion: Your task is to simplify the original text, not to add new, explanatory information. Remove the first two sentences entirely. Re-focus the text to be only about Julie Wong. You must find a way to simplify concepts without erasing key factual details like the name of an award. For example: 'In 2012, she got a special award, the Simone Fielding fellowship.'"

The consistent use of short, simple sentences is exemplary. Splitting the final complex sentence into two simpler sentences is the correct approach for this level. \n\nVocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly controlled. The use of B1 'royal' and C1 'academy' is permissible as they are part of a proper noun, 'Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship', which cannot be altered without creating a factual error. \n\nSimplification Strategy: The simplification of complex concepts is effective. Replacing 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' with 'special science magazines. Other top scientists read her work' is an excellent A2-level adaptation."

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text uses specific, high-value terms like 'leading researcher' and 'prestigious'. Your repeated use of the generic phrase 'very important' is an inadequate substitution that dilutes the meaning. It fails to convey the subject's high status and the exclusivity of her achievements.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): The text includes the words 'Royal' (B1) and 'Academy' (C1). These words are above the A2 level. As part of a proper noun, they must be explained in simple A2 terms, not used directly without context.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the core meaning. Replace 'very important scientist' with a phrase like 'one of the top scientists'. Rephrase the description of the award to convey its significance, for example, 'she got a special prize that only the best scientists receive'. Explain what the 'Royal Academy' is in simple terms, such as 'a group of the country's best scientists'."

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5962 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8864 is also below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text emphasizes the subject's high professional status with words like 'leading researcher', 'highly regarded', and 'prestigious'. Your output reduces this to 'top scientist' and 'special prize', which fails to convey the same level of professional esteem and significance. This is a critical loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore reflects the replacement of key terms. 'Leading researcher' was changed to 'top scientist'. 'Peer-reviewed journals' became 'science magazines'. 'Fellowship' became 'prize'. While simplification is required, the cumulative effect of these changes has degraded the text's fidelity to the source material beyond the acceptable limit.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'academy', which is classified as C1-level vocabulary. While it is part of a proper noun, its inclusion is a deviation from the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original's emphasis on professional prestige using A2-compliant vocabulary. The goal is simplification, not semantic dilution. Re-evaluate word choices to find A2 alternatives that more closely match the meaning of the original terms."

The text fails on two critical metrics before any qualitative analysis can be considered.\n\nFirst, the MeaningBERT score of 0.616 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message. The original text emphasizes the high prestige and specific achievements of the researcher. Your version oversimplifies these points, losing the meaning of her high status in the scientific community.\n\nSecond, the BERTScore of 0.88 is below the 0.90 threshold. This fidelity failure is caused by removing key factual words from the original text.\n\nSpecific Deviations:\n- The phrase 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was replaced with 'a top award from a group of the country's best scientists'. This removes essential factual information and is the primary cause of the low metric scores.\n- The term 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was simplified to 'important science magazines'. This loses the specific and important concept of 'peer-review'.\n- The word 'leading' was replaced with 'top'. This change contributes to the overall loss of meaning when combined with the other simplifications.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve specific names and key concepts. Do not remove the name of the award or the institution. Rephrase to explain difficult concepts like 'peer-reviewed' while keeping the original terms for fidelity. The goal is simplification, not omission of core facts."
