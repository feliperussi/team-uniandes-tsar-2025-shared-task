The primary error is the simplification of 'mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible' to 'made many bananas in a good way'.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.6518 is far below the required 0.75. The BERTScore of 0.8809 is below the required 0.90. This indicates the text has been over-simplified to the point of losing the original message and key vocabulary.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The C1 word 'profitable' from the original text was used directly in the output. The task is to simplify complex vocabulary, not to reuse it. This is a critical error.\n- Structural Degradation: The output is a list of disconnected, A1-level sentences. It is not a coherent A2 paragraph. The original text explains that the Gros Michel banana was dominant *because* of its qualities. Your version lists these as separate, unrelated facts, destroying the cause-and-effect relationship.\n- Meaning Loss: The phrase 'ruled banana farms' is a poor and inaccurate simplification of 'dominated the plantations'. It changes the meaning from 'most common' to 'in control'. The phrase 'fast and cheap way' is an inadequate replacement for 'most efficient way possible', losing the specific concept of efficiency.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to connect ideas using simple A2 connectors like 'and', 'so', and 'because'. Remove the C1 word 'profitable' and replace it with an A2 phrase like 'made a lot of money'. Combine the short, choppy sentences into more complex, yet still A2-compliant, structures to restore the original meaning.",

The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8904, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text establishes a crisis narrative from the first sentence ('facing the death of their most lucrative product'). Your version buries this critical information at the end, presenting it as a simple historical fact. This reordering fundamentally changes the message and is the primary reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of excessive simplification. Key B1/B2 concepts like 'lucrative', 'dominated', 'mass-produced', and 'efficient' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same weight, such as 'made a lot of money' and 'quickly and cheaply'. This loses lexical precision.\n\n- CEFR Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 word 'Central' in 'Central America'. This is not A2 vocabulary.\n\n- CEFR Structural Violation: The sentence 'Now the Cavendish is also being threatened' uses a present continuous passive structure ('is being threatened'). This is a B2-level grammatical structure and is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. Start with the problem, as the original does, to preserve the core message. Replace 'Central America' with an A2-compliant phrase like 'in countries in the middle of America'. Rephrase 'is also being threatened' into a simple active sentence, such as 'Now, the Cavendish banana is also in danger.' or 'Now, there is a problem with the Cavendish banana too.'",

The original describes a specific business crisis; your version reduces this to a list of simple, disconnected facts, losing the essential context of a lucrative product being threatened.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8711 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This is a direct result of oversimplification. Key factual details and vocabulary were removed. For example, the specific location 'Central American' was omitted, and precise terms like 'lucrative', 'cloned', and 'efficient' were replaced with phrases ('made a lot of money', 'copied', 'fast and cheap') that do not carry the same weight or meaning.\n\n- Factual Dilution: While no direct factual inaccuracies were found, the omission of 'Central American' is a significant loss of key information. The context is critical to the story.\n\n- Structural Simplification: The text successfully uses A2 sentence structures and vocabulary, which is why the CEFR classifier rated it A2. However, this was achieved by sacrificing the meaning and fidelity of the source text, which is a critical failure.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the core concepts.

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.883, below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Primary Failure (Meaning): The original text describes a business crisis about a 'lucrative product' and 'efficient' mass-production. Your version reduces this to 'made a lot of money' and 'fast and cheap', which loses the specific business context and the severity of the problem.\n- Secondary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. The first sentence, '...banana growers who sold bananas in Central America faced a problem,' uses a relative clause ('who sold...'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is unacceptable for an A2 text.\n- Tertiary Failure (Vocabulary): The word 'Central' is B1-level vocabulary. It was not replaced or simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts of 'lucrative' (a product that makes a very large profit) and 'efficient' (producing a lot without waste). Split the first sentence into two simple sentences to eliminate the B1 relative clause. Replace the word 'Central'.",

This is a critical factual error and an instant failure.\n\nFurther analysis reveals catastrophic failures at every subsequent level of the protocol:\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5835 is drastically below the required 0.75. Your text fails to convey the original's core message about a looming threat to a product.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8747 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing specific terms like 'Central American commercial banana growers' with inaccurate, overly simple phrases.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text is classified as B1, not the required A2. This is caused by your introduction of vocabulary outside the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Audit Failure: You introduced B1 words ('waste', 'loss', 'used') and a B2 word ('making') that were not in the original text. This is unacceptable. The phrase 'money making' is a B2 structure.\n\n- Content Addition Error: You added the sentences 'This let them grow many bananas with little waste' and 'The loss of the Gros Michel was a big money problem'. This is an interpretation, not a simplification. It introduces concepts and vocabulary not present in the source text.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the geographical location to 'Central America'. Remove all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Do not add information or interpret the text; simplify only what is present. Rephrase 'money making' to 'made the most money'. Delete the sentences about 'waste' and 'loss'.",
