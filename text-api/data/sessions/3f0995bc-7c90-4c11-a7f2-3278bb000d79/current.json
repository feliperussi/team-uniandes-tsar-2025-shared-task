    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8912 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text, even if the general meaning is preserved. This is an instant failure. Additionally, a qualitative audit reveals severe vocabulary violations. The text uses multiple B1-level words that were not simplified to the required A2 level. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Fidelity Score Violation: BERTScore is 0.8912. The minimum is 0.90.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'violent' is B1. This is too complex for A2.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'comfort' is B1. This is too complex for A2.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'lonely' is B1. This is too complex for A2.\n\nSuggestion: You must replace all vocabulary above the A2 level. Rephrase 'violent storms' to 'strong storms' or 'bad storms'. Rephrase 'gave them comfort' to 'made them feel better'. Replace 'lonely' with 'alone'. Adherence to the A2 wordlist is not optional.",
