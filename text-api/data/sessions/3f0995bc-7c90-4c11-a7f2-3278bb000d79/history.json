This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and emotional weight. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8835 falling short of the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text conveys a sense of prolonged suffering through words like 'endure', 'exhaustion', and 'overcome with... despair'. Your version reduces these complex experiences to a simple list of facts like 'They were very weak' and 'he felt... very sad'. This simplification strips the text of its intended meaning of a difficult, long-term struggle.\n\n- Lexical Downgrade: Key concepts were replaced with overly simplistic words, causing the low fidelity score. 'Endure' became 'faced', which does not carry the same meaning of survival over time. 'Despair' was reduced to 'very sad', which does not capture the original's intensity of hopelessness.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text was broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text read like a list of bullet points rather than a narrative summary, which further contributes to the loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write to restore the core concepts. Combine sentences using 'and' and 'but'. You must find A2-level ways to express the idea of a long struggle. For example, instead of 'They were very weak', use a phrase that implies duration, such as 'They were weak for a long time'. Restore the meaning of 'despair' with a phrase like 'he felt he had no hope'.",

The text fails to preserve the core emotional and experiential meaning of the original text due to oversimplification.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Endurance): The original text uses 'endure' to describe a long, difficult experience. Your replacement, 'faced', is too weak and loses the critical meaning of suffering over time.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Comfort): The original states Pi 'finds comfort' in his religions, an active process of finding emotional support. Your version, 'felt safe', is a passive state that does not capture the same meaning.\n\n- Meaning Loss (Despair): The original's 'overcome with... despair' is a powerful state of being defeated by emotion. Your replacement, 'had no hope', is a factual statement but lacks the emotional weight of the original concept.\n\n- Structural Simplification: While the CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2, the meaning was sacrificed to achieve this simplicity.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meanings. Rephrase 'faced strong storms' to 'lived through strong storms' to convey endurance. Change 'felt safe with his three religions' to 'his religions helped him feel better' to better match the concept of 'comfort'.",

Your version only includes 'despair', losing an important emotional component. The explicit concept of 'survival' is also missing.\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is a list of disconnected simple sentences. This oversimplification breaks the narrative flow. The original connects ideas using 'but', which you have omitted. This makes the text choppy and less coherent.\n\nSuggestion: Combine related ideas using basic A2 connectors. Rephrase 'Their religions helped them feel better. At other times they felt deep despair.' to 'Their religions helped them, but at other times they felt deep despair.' Re-introduce the concept of 'loneliness'. Ensure the final text communicates that they survived these difficulties.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6808 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This is the primary reason for failure. The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8847, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text connects hardship with survival (e.g., \"endure... but somehow they survive\"). Your version breaks this into disconnected statements (\"They lived through strong storms... They stayed alive despite all this.\"), which destroys the narrative meaning and contrast.\n- BERTScore Failure: Key lexical items were lost. \"Endure violent storms\" was simplified to \"lived through strong storms,\" and \"overcome with loneliness and despair\" was weakened to \"felt deep loneliness. They also felt despair.\" This loss of specific phrasing caused the score to drop.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level word \"despite\". This is an automatic violation of the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n- Structural Fragmentation: The text is broken into too many short, simple sentences. This makes the text sound unnatural and damages the flow of the story. The sentence \"They also felt despair.\" should not stand alone.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine sentences to restore the original's logical connections. Remove the B1 word \"despite\" and rephrase using A2 vocabulary, such as \"It was very difficult, but they stayed alive.\" Combine the ideas of \"loneliness\" and \"despair\" into a single sentence to better reflect the original text.",
