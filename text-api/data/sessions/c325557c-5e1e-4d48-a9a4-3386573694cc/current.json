    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The core facts of the original text are maintained.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.85 and BERTScore at 0.93 confirm high fidelity. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. Simplifications such as 'blind' to 'cannot see' and 'expeditions' to 'trips' are executed correctly.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is composed of short, simple sentences, which is ideal for the A2 standard.\n- Point of Minor Information Loss: The original text specifies that Erik helps 'people with disabilities'. Your version states he 'helps people'. While this does not constitute a failure, it is a loss of specific information. For a perfect score, this detail should be retained using A2 language.",
