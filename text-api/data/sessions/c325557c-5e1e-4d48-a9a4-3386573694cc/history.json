        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7161 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to preserve the core message of the original. Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8519 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of key phrasing and vocabulary from the original text. Loss of Narrative: The original text presents Erik as a 'multi-adventurer' by listing his amazing achievements together. Your version breaks these achievements into separate, disconnected facts. This destroys the narrative and the sense of wonder. Incorrect Tense: The original uses past tense ('ridden', 'kayaked', 'climbed') to describe completed achievements. Your use of present simple ('rides', 'kayaks', 'climbs') changes the meaning to habitual actions, which is a factual deviation from the source. Structural Over-simplification: The text is excessively fragmented into short sentences. This makes it read like a list, not a coherent paragraph, which is the primary cause of the low meaning scores. Suggestion: Recombine the sentences about his adventures using the connector 'and'. For example: 'He rides a bike in Morocco, kayaks in the Grand Canyon, and climbs Everest.' This restores the idea of multiple accomplishments. Suggestion: Use the correct tense to describe past events. Suggestion: Do not add definitional sentences into the main body of the text; they disrupt the flow and are not part of the original narrative.",

Your version states he 'helps people'. While this does not constitute a failure, it is a loss of specific information. For a perfect score, this detail should be retained using A2 language.",
