This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text contrasts 'coincidence' with 'prophecy'. Your version replaces 'prophecy' with 'see the future', which is a less precise concept and weakens the original argument.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.88 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is due to the replacement of specific phrases like 'death of someone close' with simpler ones like 'someone you know dies', losing lexical accuracy.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'coincidence' is used. This is an immediate violation of the A2 standard. While you correctly explained it with 'It happens by chance', the complex word itself must be removed entirely.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the sentence 'It is just a coincidence.' The following sentence, 'It happens by chance,' is sufficient and A2-compliant. Rephrase to better capture the original's contrast between a special power and simple chance.",

The provided text fails on two critical metrics, indicating a significant deviation from the source material's core message and phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7152 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text presents a clear argument contrasting coincidence with prophecy. Your version lists disconnected facts and fails to preserve this central argument, resulting in a critical loss of meaning.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8905 is below the 0.90 minimum. This failure is a direct result of replacing key phrases like \"result of coincidence\" and \"choose to forget\" with phrases that are too lexically distant from the source text. This damages the factual fidelity.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. You must restore the core contrast between a dream being a message about the future versus it being a chance event. The logical link between the sentences is too weak. Rephrase to improve lexical similarity to the original without introducing complex vocabulary. The current version is a list of simple statements, not a simplified explanation.",
