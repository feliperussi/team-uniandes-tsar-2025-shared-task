        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for this failure is the unacceptable loss of the original text's core meaning, evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.6891, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. While the text is factually correct and structurally simple, the over-simplification has damaged the message.\n\n*   **MeaningBERT Violation:** The score of 0.6891 indicates a critical failure. The original text poses a question about societal perception: 'Are they welcome or are they considered a danger or a pest?'. Your version, 'Do people like them? Or do people think they are a danger or a pest?', reduces this complex question to a simple matter of personal feeling.\n*   **Nuance Destruction:** The word 'welcome' implies an active acceptance into a shared space. Your replacement, 'like', is a vague, general feeling and does not carry the same meaning. Similarly, 'considered' implies a collective judgment or classification, which is lost when replaced by the more individual action of 'think'. This simplification is not permissible.\n*   **Positive Note (Insufficient for PASS):** The text correctly adheres to A2 vocabulary and uses short, simple sentences. The definition of 'pest' was an appropriate addition. However, these structural successes cannot compensate for the failure to preserve the original meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the lost nuance. Rephrase the final questions to accurately reflect the concepts of 'welcome' and 'considered'. For example: 'Do people welcome these animals?' and 'Does society see them as a danger?'."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for this failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6823, which is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message during simplification.\n\n*   **Meaning Loss Analysis:** The original text states, 'in recent years, the world's press has been full of reports of wild animals coming into cities in bigger and bigger numbers.' This conveys a specific meaning: a recent, escalating, and widely reported global trend. Your version, 'But now, something is different. Newspapers and TV news have many stories...' is too vague. The phrase 'something is different' is imprecise and fails to capture the concepts of 'recent years' and 'bigger and bigger numbers'. The simplification has removed essential nuance, resulting in the unacceptable MeaningBERT score.\n*   **CEFR Compliance:** The text correctly achieved an A2 classification. The sentence structure is simple and appropriate for the level.\n*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is compliant with the A2 level. The definition provided for 'pest' is a correct procedure for introducing a potentially difficult word.\n\nDespite passing the CEFR classification and vocabulary checks, the failure to preserve the original meaning is a critical error. The purpose of simplification is not to remove meaning, but to make it accessible.\n\n**Suggestion:** You must rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. The sentence 'But now, something is different' must be replaced. A more accurate A2-level sentence would be: 'But in the last few years, news stories say that more and more big animals are coming to cities.' This phrasing restores the concepts of a recent and increasing trend."

It provides specific, actionable reasons for the failure, citing the 'unacceptably low MeaningBERT score' and quoting specific phrases like 'the world's press has been full of reports' versus 'news stories say' to illustrate the meaning loss. The inclusion of a concrete 'Suggestion' with an example sentence makes the feedback exceptionally clear and helpful."
