    "text_translated": "You can often see small animals in cities and towns. For example, you can see birds, squirrels, mice, and insects. But in the last few years, news stories say that more and more big, wild animals are coming to cities. For example, people saw bears in parks in Vancouver. They saw leopards on the streets of Mumbai. And they saw wild pigs in gardens in Berlin. What happens when big animals come into our cities? Do people welcome these animals? Or do people see them as a danger or a pest? A pest is an animal that makes problems.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The feedback is exemplary. It is direct and blunt, starting immediately with 'FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure'. It provides specific, actionable reasons for the failure, citing the 'unacceptably low MeaningBERT score' and quoting specific phrases like 'the world's press has been full of reports' versus 'news stories say' to illustrate the meaning loss. The inclusion of a concrete 'Suggestion' with an example sentence makes the feedback exceptionally clear and helpful.",
