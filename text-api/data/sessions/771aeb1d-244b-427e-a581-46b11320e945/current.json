    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual and Meaning Integrity: The output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning. This is confirmed by a MeaningBERT score of 0.7575 and a BERTScore of 0.9194, both of which are above the required thresholds.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text was correctly classified as A2, indicating it meets the target readability level.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. Complex concepts were successfully simplified. For example, 'evolved' was rephrased as 'changed over a long time' and 'artefacts' became 'old things'. This is exemplary A2 simplification.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text is constructed from short, simple sentences. This structure is appropriate for the A2 level and enhances readability.",
