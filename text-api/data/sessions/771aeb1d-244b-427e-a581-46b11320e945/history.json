This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for this failure is oversimplification that changes the meaning. The original text discusses the origin of 'complex language'. Your output reduces this to 'why people can talk', which is a fundamentally different and less specific concept. The nuance of complexity is lost.\n- The original text's concept of evolution ('when and why they evolved that way') was simplified to 'why they changed over a long time'. While an acceptable simplification in some contexts, combined with other meaning losses, it contributes to the low score.\n- The original's 'evolved the ability to create complex sounds' was reduced to 'people changed' and 'could make many different sounds'. This loses the key biological concept of evolution as the driver of the change.\n- While the BERTScore of 0.9052 is acceptable and the text correctly classifies as A2, these cannot override the failure to maintain the original's core meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the concept of 'complex language' and 'evolution'. Rephrase the opening to focus on how humans learned to use difficult or complex words. Ensure the text explains that brains and bodies changed slowly over time, which is what 'evolution' means. The goal is simplification, not meaning alteration.",

The original text's core message about biological 'capability' and 'ability' was not preserved. Your text changes this to 'how people learned', which is a different concept. The phrase 'humans evolved more' is vague and loses the specific meaning of 'evolved the ability to create complex sounds'.\n\nAdditional Violations:\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'clues' is B1 level. It must be replaced. The word 'means' is listed as B2 and should be avoided.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentences 'It is also important what our brains can do' and 'And it is important why they evolved' use complex 'wh-clauses' as complements. This is a B1 structure and is too complex for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore the original meaning of physical ability, not learned skill. Simplify the complex clauses into separate, simple sentences. Replace the word 'clues' with an A2 alternative like 'information' or 'answers'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7433 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of nuance. The original text establishes a direct conditional link: 'If we want to know X, we need to look at Y.' Your version breaks this into two separate, simple statements: 'We want to know X. We need to look at Y.' This separation severs the logical connection and fails to preserve the original meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'evolve' was used multiple times. While a definition was included in the text, this is an unacceptable deviation. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 level. The word was not declared in the Keywords section, which is a procedural failure.\n\n- Structural Oversimplification: The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. This damages the logical flow and is the primary cause of the low meaning preservation score. The text reads like a list of facts, not a coherent explanation.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore of 0.9069 is barely passing. Key concepts like 'capability for complex language' were reduced to 'ability to use difficult language', losing lexical precision.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine sentences to restore logical links using A2-level connectors like 'so' or 'because'. Remove the word 'evolve' entirely and rephrase using A2 vocabulary, such as 'how humans changed over a very long time'. You must prioritize preserving the connections between ideas, not just the ideas themselves.",
