    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7453 is below the required threshold of 0.75. This indicates a loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The simplification of 'inequality and discrimination' to 'when life is not fair for everyone' was not precise enough, causing the low MeaningBERT score. The original concepts are more specific than a general sense of unfairness.\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): The text uses the B1-level word 'political'. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about problems to be more specific. Example: 'Their art made people think about problems like war, or why some people are not treated the same as others.' Remove the word 'political'. Replace 'make political points' with a simpler A2 phrase like 'share ideas about the country or the government'.",
