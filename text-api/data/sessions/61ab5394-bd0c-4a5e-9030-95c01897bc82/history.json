The simplification process has removed the strength and precision of the original message.\n\n- Core Meaning Dilution: The original text states artists wanted to \"make political points\". Your version, \"share their ideas\", is too weak and fails to capture the intended meaning of protest or commentary. This is the primary reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word \"being\" is B2 level. Its use in the phrase \"people not being treated the same\" is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard. This passive structure is too complex.\n- Structural Complexity: The phrase \"art about people not being treated the same\" is a complex noun phrase that is difficult for an A2 reader to parse. The concepts of \"inequality\" and \"discrimination\" must be broken down into simpler, separate sentences.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning with simpler words. Remove the B2-level word \"being\". Rephrase complex ideas into separate, simple sentences. Instead of \"art about people not being treated the same\", write \"They made art about unfairness. Some people were not treated the same as others.\"",
