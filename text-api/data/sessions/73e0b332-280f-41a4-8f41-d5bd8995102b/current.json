    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8924 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key lexical items and phrasing from the original. - The original verb \u2018develop\u2019 was replaced by \u2018grow\u2019, reducing the precise meaning. - The phrase \u2018produce language\u2019 was simplified to \u2018make language\u2019, losing technical nuance. - The connector \u2018through\u2019 in \u2018through cave paintings for example\u2019 was removed, weakening the explanatory structure. Suggestion: Restore the original terms \u2018develop\u2019 and \u2018produce\u2019, and reinstate the connector \u2018through cave paintings for example\u2019 to improve fidelity and raise BERTScore.",
