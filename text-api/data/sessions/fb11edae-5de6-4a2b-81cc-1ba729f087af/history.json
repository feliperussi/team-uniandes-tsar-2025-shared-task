However, the output incorrectly states 'the small lights from the steel wheels and tracks could sometimes make a bridge catch fire'. A 'spark' is a hot, glowing particle capable of igniting flammable material, which is the correct mechanism for starting a fire in this context. 'Small lights' are not inherently hot or capable of causing a fire. This change fundamentally alters the cause of the fire described in the original text, introducing a significant factual inaccuracy. The simplification must preserve the core factual mechanism.",

While the text appears to retain the core information, the semantic simplification of phrases like 'historically' to 'in the past', 'particularly true' to 'especially true', and 'burn to the ground' to 'burn completely' may have subtly altered the overall semantic representation, leading to a lower score. The model might interpret these as a loss of nuance or specific detail, even if the general idea is maintained. To improve, ensure that simplifications do not inadvertently reduce the semantic richness or specificity that the MeaningBERT model is designed to detect.

While the writer made an attempt to simplify by splitting a complex sentence, the overall linguistic complexity remains too high for a B1 target audience. Specifically, the phrase 'susceptible to fire' is typically considered B2 level. Additionally, the word 'spark' is classified as C1 vocabulary and was not simplified or defined, which contributes to the higher complexity. To achieve B1, consider replacing 'susceptible to fire' with a simpler phrase like 'could easily catch fire' or 'burned easily'. Also, evaluate if 'spark' can be rephrased or if a brief, simpler explanation is needed for a B1 reader. The second sentence, even after being split, could potentially be further simplified in its structure or vocabulary.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8472 and BERTScore of 0.9634 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. The simplification strategy was highly effective. Phrases like 'much more susceptible to fire' were appropriately simplified to 'could easily catch fire', and 'spark created by' was clearly rephrased as 'could make a small flame'. The expression 'burn to the ground' was also well simplified to 'burn completely'. The use of connectors like 'and', 'especially true for', 'where', and 'which could sometimes cause' is appropriate for the B1 level, contributing to a clear and coherent flow. The vocabulary choices are well-suited for a B1 audience, making the text accessible without losing essential detail. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
