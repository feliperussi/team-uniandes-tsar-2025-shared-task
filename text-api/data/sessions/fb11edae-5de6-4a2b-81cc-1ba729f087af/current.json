    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8472 and BERTScore of 0.9634 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. The simplification strategy was highly effective. Phrases like 'much more susceptible to fire' were appropriately simplified to 'could easily catch fire', and 'spark created by' was clearly rephrased as 'could make a small flame'. The expression 'burn to the ground' was also well simplified to 'burn completely'. The use of connectors like 'and', 'especially true for', 'where', and 'which could sometimes cause' is appropriate for the B1 level, contributing to a clear and coherent flow. The vocabulary choices are well-suited for a B1 audience, making the text accessible without losing essential detail. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
