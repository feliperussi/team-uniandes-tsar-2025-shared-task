        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on multiple priority checks, starting with meaning and fidelity metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6552 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.886 is also below the 0.90 minimum. These scores indicate a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail. Furthermore, the text fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT 0.6552): The original text creates a contrast between the trouble a good rider could find and the even greater trouble a non-rider could find. Your version breaks this into disconnected statements, losing the comparative and speculative meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore 0.886): Key lexical items from the original were replaced with overly simple terms, reducing fidelity. For example, 'property' became 'land', and 'escape on foot' became 'run away on foot'.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (Classifier: B1): The text is too complex for A2. It contains B1 grammatical structures and vocabulary.\n\n- B1 Grammar: The sentence \"Sam wondered if the boy could ride the horse\" uses a reported question ('wondered if...'). This is a B1 structure.\n\n- B1 Grammar: The sentence \"There could be many problems for someone who can ride a horse\" uses a defining relative clause ('who can ride...'). This structure elevates the complexity to B1.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word 'rebellious' is not A2 vocabulary. It must be replaced.\n\nSuggestion: Simplify all B1 grammar immediately. Rephrase \"Sam wondered if...\" to \"Sam thought, 'Can the boy ride?'\". Break the relative clause into two simple sentences, such as \"A person can ride a horse. This person can have many problems.\" Replace the word 'rebellious' with an A2 alternative like 'angry' or 'difficult'.",

Your version incorrectly claims 'A person who can ride a horse could have less trouble'. This is a fundamental misrepresentation of the source material.\n\n- Factual Error: You have inverted the meaning. The original text contrasts two types of trouble, not a presence versus an absence of trouble.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.696 is well below the required 0.75. This confirms the core message about the nature of the trouble was lost.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8748 is below the 0.90 threshold. Key descriptive phrases like 'as far as the eye could see' and 'miles away from anyone' were removed, losing important context and detail.\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes it read like a list, not a story.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to be factually accurate. Restore the original idea that a good rider could find a lot of trouble, but a boy who cannot ride might find even more. Combine some of the choppy sentences to create a more natural A2-level narrative.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and context.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text describes a vast, inescapable property and a character's thoughts about a hypothetical rebellious boy. Your output reduces this to a simple list of facts like 'The land is far' and 'A teenage boy is bored and angry'. This loses the essential meaning of scale, the feeling of being trapped, and the speculative nature of the original passage.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8634 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key descriptive phrases like 'stretched as far as the eye could see' and 'barely visible' were completely removed, destroying the original's imagery and lexical substance.\n\n- Grammatical Errors: The text contains basic subject-verb agreement errors. 'Sam see horse kick' is incorrect. 'A boy who know nothing' is incorrect. These errors are unacceptable.\n\n- Over-simplification: The output is a disconnected list of sentences. The narrative flow is gone. The sentences are too choppy and lack simple connectors to link the ideas together.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text. You must restore the core meaning of a vast, inescapable place. Do not change the character's thoughts from a hypothetical idea to a direct statement of fact. Correct all grammatical errors; verbs must agree with their subjects. Use simple connectors like 'and' or 'but' to create a coherent paragraph, not a list.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7156 is below the required 0.75, and the BERTScore of 0.8849 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of the original message and lexical detail.\n\n- Metric Failure: The low scores are a direct result of oversimplification. Changing the character trait 'rebellious' to the emotion 'angry' alters the meaning. Reducing the specific warning 'There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here' to the vague 'Riding could bring more trouble here' loses critical context.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 words 'barely' and 'visible' were not replaced. The sentence 'The fences are barely visible' is not A2 compliant.\n- Tense Inconsistency: The original narrative is in the past tense. Your output shifts entirely to the present tense. This is an unacceptable alteration of the source text's narrative structure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original past tense. Rephrase the sentence containing 'barely visible' using A2 vocabulary, for example, 'You can only just see the fences'. Restore the meaning of 'rebellious' with a phrase like 'does not want to follow rules'. Restore the lost meaning about the rider.",
