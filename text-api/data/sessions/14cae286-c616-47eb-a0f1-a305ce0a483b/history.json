This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text states the games are used to punish the districts 'for rebelling'. Your version simplifies this to 'because the people did not follow the rules'. This simplification is too broad and loses the specific, violent context of a past rebellion, which is central to the meaning. The model correctly identified this as a major semantic shift.\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): The text uses the B1-level words 'punish' and 'battle'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below, unless defined as a keyword.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the reason for the games to more closely reflect the concept of a past rebellion. For example: 'Long ago, the people fought the government. Now, the government uses the games to show the people they are not in control.' Replace 'punish' and 'battle' with A2 alternatives. Use 'a big fight' instead of 'battle'."

Your version, 'make people remember a fight from the past' and 'show the people they did something wrong', completely removes the core concept of punishment. This is an unacceptable alteration of the source material's meaning.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The word 'battle' is B1 level. Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard. The A2 word 'fight' was available and should have been used consistently.\n\nFactual Omission: The original text specifies the children are chosen 'by lottery'. This key detail was omitted from your text, which is a factual inaccuracy.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to explicitly state the games are a punishment. Replace the word 'battle' with 'fight'.

Your version, 'to punish the people', loses the critical nuance of psychological control and continuous reminder.

These words are not on the A2 list and must be replaced or explained in A2 terms.\n\n- Structural Issue: The sentence 'Every year, one boy and one girl are chosen from each part of the country by lottery' is too long and complex for a clean A2 classification. It combines multiple pieces of information into one sentence.\n\n- Corrective Actions: Rephrase to restore the original meaning of 'remind'.

Your version states the games are used 'to punish the people'. This is a factual shift. The games are a reminder of a past punishment, not the punishment itself. This loss of nuance is a severe error.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'punish' is classified as B1 level. Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard. A2 texts must not contain unsimplified B1 vocabulary.\n\n- Keyword Definition: The definition for 'tributes' is adequate, but it does not compensate for the primary failures in meaning and vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning. The text must explain that the games are a reminder. Rephrase the sentence to avoid the B1 word 'punish'. Example: 'The government uses the games to make people remember that fighting the government was wrong.'"

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Meaning Deviation: The original text states the games are used 'to remind the districts that they are being punished'. Your version states the government 'uses the games to punish the people'. This is not the same. The original implies a continuous psychological control (a reminder), while your version describes a direct action. The core meaning of the event as a 'reminder' has been lost.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'punish' is classified as B1 level. Its use is a direct violation of the A2 standard. A2 texts must not use vocabulary above their level without simplification.\n\n- Structural Note: While the sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2, the failures in meaning and vocabulary are too severe to ignore.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The concept of a 'reminder' is central. Rephrase the sentence to explain this concept using only A2 words.

Your text simplifies this to 'tell people not to fight', which is a different, less specific meaning. This semantic shift is the primary cause of the low MeaningBERT score. 2. Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'punishment' was retained from the original text. This is a direct violation of A2 standards. All vocabulary must conform to the A2 level. Corrective Actions: Rephrase the first four sentences to restore the original meaning of a 'reminder'. Do not use the word 'punishment'. Explain the concept using A2 words. Example: 'The government makes people have the games every year. This is to make them remember a big fight from the past. The games show that fighting the government is bad.'"

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text states the games are used 'to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. This is a single, complex idea. Your version splits this into 'The government uses the games to punish the people. This is because they fought the government in the past.' This separation fundamentally alters the meaning from a 'reminder of punishment' to a simple 'punishment' with a separate reason, causing the metric failure.\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The B1-level word 'punish' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary. It must be replaced with a simpler A2-level explanation.\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The C1-level word 'tributes' was used. While defining it is the correct procedure, the word itself is far outside the A2 level.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the first three sentences to restore the original's core meaning. The games are a tool to show people the consequence of their past actions. For example: 'The government uses the games to show the people that they were wrong to fight in the past.'\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'punish'. Use a simple A2 phrase.\n- Suggestion: The sentence structure is good. It is simple and clear. Maintain this structure but correct the meaning and vocabulary."
