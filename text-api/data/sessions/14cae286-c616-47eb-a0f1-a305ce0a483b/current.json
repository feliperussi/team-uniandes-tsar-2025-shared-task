    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to punish the people. In the past, the people fought the government. The games are the punishment. Every year, the government chooses one boy and one girl from each part of the country. They are between 12 and 18 years old. The government chooses them by luck. These young people are called 'tributes'. Tributes are the people who fight in the games. They fight, and only one person can live. Everyone in the country must watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6203 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure: The original text states the Capitol uses the games to 'remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. Your version separates this into disconnected facts: 'In the past, the people fought the government. The games are the punishment.' This completely loses the essential concept of the games being a constant, annual 'reminder', which is central to the original meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'punish' and 'punishment'. These words are not compliant with the A2 standard and must be replaced with simpler A2 explanations.\n\n- Structural Weakness: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. While simple sentences are required for A2, the lack of basic connectors like 'so' or 'because' contributes to the loss of meaning between ideas.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Explain the concept of punishment using only A2 words. Example: 'Long ago, the people fought the government. So, the government makes them have the games every year. The games show the people that the government is strong.' Remove the words 'punish' and 'punishment' immediately.",
