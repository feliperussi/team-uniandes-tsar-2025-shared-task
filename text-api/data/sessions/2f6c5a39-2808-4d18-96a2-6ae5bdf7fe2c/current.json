These large families then had even more children, who grew up to become adults and have their own families. However, things changed in the 1960s. Contraception became more widely available. Contraception means methods used to stop a woman from having a baby. Since then, the global average number of babies for each woman has declined from six down to just two.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.87 and BERTScore of 0.93 are very high, confirming that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The writer's strategy was exemplary, particularly in splitting the final complex sentence into several shorter, clearer sentences. The required keyword 'contraception' was also defined clearly and naturally within the text, which is a model of best practice. This is a high-quality submission with no major areas for improvement.",
