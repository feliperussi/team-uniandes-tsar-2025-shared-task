This indicates the core message was not adequately preserved.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The addition of the sentence 'A religion is a way to believe in God' at the beginning of the text fundamentally alters the focus. The original text is a specific narrative about a character. Your version begins with a generic explanation, which reduces the semantic similarity and causes the metric failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level words 'priest' and 'baker' were used without being defined in simple A2 terms. All vocabulary above A2 must be defined.\n- Structural Issue: The text was split into two paragraphs. This is an unnecessary structural change that distances the output from the original's narrative flow.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the opening definitional sentence. It is not part of the original text. The text must be a single paragraph. Define the B1 words 'priest' and 'baker' using simple A2 vocabulary (e.g., 'a man who works for the church', 'a man who makes bread').",

Definitions must use simpler A2-level vocabulary to be effective.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the narrative connection between sentences.

The final sentence must be rephrased to retain the subject of religion. Change 'let him decide for himself' to 'let him decide about religion for himself'.
