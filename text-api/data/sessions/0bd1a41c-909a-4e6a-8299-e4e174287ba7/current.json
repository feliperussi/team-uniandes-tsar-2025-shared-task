    "text_translated": "Religion (what people think about God) is important to Pi. His family is Hindu, but Pi is interested in other religions. He makes friends with a Christian priest (a man who works for the church) and a Muslim baker (a man who makes bread). Then Pi says something that surprises everyone. He says he is Hindu, Muslim, and Christian at the same time. His family and teachers ask him to choose one religion. But Pi does not want to choose. He says, \"I just want to love God\". After that, his family and teachers let him decide about religion for himself.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with the A2 standard.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is a factually perfect representation of the original text.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.7965 and BERTScore at 0.9402 confirm excellent meaning and lexical preservation. The CEFR_Classifier_Result of A2 is correct.\n- Vocabulary Control: The B1-level words 'religion', 'priest', and 'baker' were correctly identified and defined using simple, A2-appropriate parenthetical explanations. This is the correct procedure.\n- Structural Simplification: Complex sentence structures from the original text were successfully simplified. The subordinate clause starting with 'Though' was correctly rephrased using 'but'. The complex sentence 'To everyone's surprise, Pi declares himself...' was correctly broken into two simpler sentences. The text uses only A2-level connectors ('but', 'and', 'then', 'after that').\n\nThis output is an exemplary execution of the A2 simplification task.",
