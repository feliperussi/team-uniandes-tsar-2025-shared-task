    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8859 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words from the original text. The text also fails for CEFR non-compliance.\n\n- Fidelity Deviation: Key terms like 'cave paintings' and 'human civilisation' were replaced with 'pictures in caves' and 'human society'. This oversimplification reduces lexical fidelity below the acceptable threshold, causing the low BERTScore.\n- CEFR Deviation: The text was classified as B1, not A2. The sentence 'No one knows how the pictures are linked to language' uses a subordinate clause beginning with 'how'. This is a B1 grammatical structure. A2 level requires simpler sentence constructions.\n- Suggestion: Restore key terms like 'cave paintings' to increase fidelity. Break the B1 sentence into two simple A2 sentences. Example: 'The pictures have a link to language. No one knows what it is.'",
