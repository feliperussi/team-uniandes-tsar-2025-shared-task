Your text incorrectly narrows this to 'the link between the paintings and language', which is a different and more specific claim. This is an unacceptable alteration of the source material's meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'cave' is classified as B1 level. Its use in 'cave paintings' violates the strict A2 vocabulary requirement. All words must conform to the A2 standard.\n\n- Metrics Deception: While the text passed the automated metric checks (MeaningBERT: 0.9085, BERTScore: 0.907), this case demonstrates the failure of metrics to detect nuanced factual errors. Manual verification, which is the highest priority, revealed the critical flaw.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the third sentence to restore the original meaning. It must connect 'early human civilisation' or 'how people started to live' with language, not just the paintings.

Key terms were replaced with phrases that are lexically distant from the source.\n- Evidence: The term 'civilisation' was replaced with 'life'. The specific term 'cave paintings' was replaced with the generic description 'pictures on walls inside hills'. While these changes improve readability, they reduce the direct word-for-word fidelity measured by the BERTScore metric, resulting in a score below the minimum requirement.\n- Secondary Analysis: The text successfully meets the A2 classification and uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and sentence structures. However, the failure on the fidelity metric is absolute and cannot be overlooked.\n\nSuggestion: To pass, the text must maintain a BERTScore of 0.90 or higher.

The original text's core concept of 'early human civilisation' was oversimplified to 'early people started to live together', which is a significant loss of meaning.\n\nFidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8804 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a failure to retain key words. Important terms like 'civilisation' and 'evidence' were completely removed, damaging the text's fidelity to the source.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error in the first sentence.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the violation of core meaning and fidelity metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.716 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the original message. The BERTScore of 0.8831 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a loss of key vocabulary. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR compliance check, as the provided classifier result was 'B1', not the required 'A2'.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original sentence 'we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation, through cave paintings' was broken into three disconnected sentences. This fragmentation destroyed the logical link between the evidence and the conclusion, causing the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Fidelity Loss: Key terms like 'civilisation' and 'cave paintings' were replaced. While simplification is necessary, the chosen replacements were too generic, causing the BERTScore to drop below the required threshold.\n- Structural Error: The text is overly simplified to the point of being unnatural. The sequence 'we see signs. The signs are pictures in caves. The pictures are evidence' is grammatically correct but stylistically poor and contributes to the meaning loss.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine fragmented ideas into simple, complete sentences. Restore the logical connection. Example: 'We see evidence of early human society from pictures in caves.' This single sentence is A2 compliant and preserves the meaning of the original. Avoid breaking every clause into a new sentence.",
