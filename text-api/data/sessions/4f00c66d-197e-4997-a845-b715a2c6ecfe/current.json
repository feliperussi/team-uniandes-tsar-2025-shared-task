    "text_translated": "NASA is now working to find and record some of the smaller asteroids, which are large rocks that travel through space, especially those that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists believe there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but so far they have only found about 8,000, so 17,000 have not been found yet. These middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter the area around the Earth, because a much smaller 19-metre asteroid exploded above a city in Russia in 2013 and injured 1,200 people.",
