Your version weakens this into a series of separate, less impactful possibilities: 'If you do not understand... it can cause problems. You might think bad things... You might also understand them...' This fragmentation loses the original's sense of direct consequence.\n\n- Key concepts were oversimplified, leading to meaning loss. The original's 'nuances and expectations of business communication' was reduced to 'the ways people communicate', which is too general and loses the specific meaning of subtle but important rules.\n\n- The positive outcome was also weakened. The original states the information will 'stand you in good stead' (provide a distinct advantage). Your version, 'This information can help you', is a much weaker and less precise statement.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the strong, direct link between misunderstanding and its specific negative outcomes. Combine the sentences describing the problems to show they are direct results of a single cause. Use phrasing that better captures the meaning of 'nuances', such as 'small but important differences' or 'special rules'."

This loses the critical professional context.\n\n- Semantic Shift: The consequence of 'unfair judgements' was changed to 'think bad things about you that are not true'. This shifts the meaning from a professional misjudgment to a personal dislike, which is a significant semantic error.\n\n- Loss of Concept: The original phrase 'stand you in good stead' implies gaining a future advantage. Your simplification to 'This can help you' is too weak and fails to capture this important concept.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the professional context of the original. Rephrase to restore the concepts of professional communication rules, incorrect professional judgments, and gaining a business advantage. For example, 'unfair judgements' must be rephrased as 'people can make wrong decisions about you in business', not 'think bad things'."

Meaning Loss: The original text's concept of 'breakdowns in communication' is a severe failure. Your version, 'Communication can stop working', is too weak and does not carry the same weight. The original's 'nuances and expectations' was simplified to 'small, important differences', losing the specific meaning of subtle social rules. Fidelity Loss: Key phrases were oversimplified, causing the low BERTScore. 'Conducted across international borders' was reduced to 'is international', losing lexical detail. 'Global business community' became 'Business people all over the world', a less precise equivalent. Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'communication' was used three times. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard. This word must be replaced. Suggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the original's meaning regarding the severity of misunderstandings. Replace the B1 word 'communication' with an A2-level phrase such as 'how people talk and share information at work'."

Suggestion: 'This can cause communication to break.' or 'This can make communication stop completely.'\n- Replace B1 Vocabulary: Remove all B1 words. Replace 'communication' with 'talking to people'.

This indicates a critical loss of the original message's core concepts. The BERTScore of 0.8972 is also below the 0.90 minimum, showing a loss of key phrasing.\n\n- Core Meaning Lost: The original text specifies negative outcomes like 'unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies this to 'cause problems' and 'understand you in the wrong way', which is too vague and loses the specific meaning.\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level word 'communication' three times. This word is not compliant with the A2 standard. The words 'cultural' and 'basic' are also B1 level and must be replaced.\n- Lexical Fidelity Lost: Key phrases from the original were over-simplified, contributing to the low BERTScore. For example, 'nuances and expectations of business communication' became 'rules for polite communication', which is not an equivalent concept.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the specific negative outcomes using A2 vocabulary. For example, instead of 'communication stop', use 'people can stop talking to each other'. Replace all B1 words. 'Communication' must be rephrased as 'how people talk' or 'sharing information'. 'Cultural' must be rephrased as 'from different cultures'."

The original's 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication' were replaced with 'think bad things' and 'communication can stop'. This is a significant dilution of meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is below the threshold because key lexical items were oversimplified or removed. Phrases like 'global business community' and 'cultural norms and practices' were lost, reducing fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 noun 'communication' is used twice. This is not A2 vocabulary. The verb 'communicate' is A2; the noun is not.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The verb 'means' used for a definition ('Business etiquette means...') is B2 level. This is a clear violation of the A2 standard.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'People may think bad things about you that are not true' uses a relative 'that-clause'. This is a B1 grammatical structure. It must be simplified.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the concepts of 'judgement' and 'breakdown'. Replace the noun 'communication' with an A2 phrase like 'sharing information'. Replace 'means' with 'is'. Split the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two separate, simple sentences."

Your version dilutes this to 'people can have a bad idea about you' and 'create problems when you talk'. This is a critical loss of meaning.

Your version simplifies this to 'the small, important ways people talk' and 'the normal ways people act'. This oversimplification removes the professional, business-specific context, which is the central point of the source text.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of removing key lexical items from the original.

Your version, 'think bad things about you' and 'talking to each other stops completely', is too general and childish, failing to convey the professional severity.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the focus on a professional business context. Re-introduce concepts like 'culture' and 'communication rules for business'.

The primary failure is a catastrophic loss of meaning from the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Score Violation: The MeaningBERT score is 0.605. This is drastically below the required minimum of 0.75. The simplification process has destroyed the core message. The original text specifies consequences like 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version reduces these to the vague phrases 'think bad things about you' and 'talking and writing with them can stop'. This is an unacceptable loss of meaning.\n\n- BERTScore Violation: The BERTScore is 0.8847, which is below the required minimum of 0.90. This indicates a failure to retain key lexical information. Important concepts from the original, such as 'cultural norms and practices' and 'business acquaintances', were completely removed instead of being simplified. This damages the text's fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Level Note: While the text was classified as A2, it only achieved this level by sacrificing essential information. This is not a successful simplification.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. You must find A2-level ways to express the specific concepts from the original. Do not simply delete them. For example, instead of 'cause problems', you must rephrase to explain the specific problems of 'misunderstandings' and 'communication stopping'. A more faithful simplification would be: 'If you do not understand these cultural rules, people can misunderstand you. This can stop good communication between you.'"

This simplification is too aggressive and loses the essential meaning of subtle, unwritten cultural behaviors.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.891 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90.

These are not compliant with the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. Instead of 'rules', use a phrase like 'different ideas about what is polite at work'. Replace 'judge' with 'think bad things about you'.

This indicates a severe loss of the original message's core meaning. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8878, which is below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Primary Deviation (Meaning): The original text discusses 'nuances and expectations of business communication' and 'cultural norms'. Your version oversimplifies this to 'different ideas about what is polite'. This is a critical loss of meaning. Politeness is only one part of business communication norms.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Fidelity): Key lexical items from the original text were lost. Phrases like 'international borders', 'global business community', and 'breakdowns in communication' were replaced with overly simple terms like 'different countries', 'business people around the world', and 'stop good talking'. This reduces the text's fidelity to the source.\n\n- Structural Compliance: While the sentence structure is correctly simplified for an A2 level and the definition of 'etiquette' is adequate, these cannot compensate for the failure to preserve the original text's meaning and key vocabulary.\n\n- Suggestion: You must re-integrate the core concepts from the original text. Rephrase to include the idea of 'different rules' or 'different ways of communicating', not just 'politeness'. Restore the concept of 'communication problems' or 'misunderstandings' which is stronger than 'stop good talking'."
