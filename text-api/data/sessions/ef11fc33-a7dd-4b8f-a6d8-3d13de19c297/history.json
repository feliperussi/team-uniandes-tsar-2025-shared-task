Your version generalizes this to 'a city in Russia', which is a critical omission of data.\n\n- Deviation 1 (Factual): The proper noun 'Chelyabinsk' was removed. This is an unacceptable loss of factual detail. The core task is to simplify, not to remove key facts.\n- Deviation 2 (Lexical): The original text describes the asteroids as 'middle-sized'. Your version uses 'bigger'. While not a critical error, it changes the nuance. The point is that even these are not the largest asteroids, but they are still dangerous.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the proper noun 'Chelyabinsk' to maintain factual integrity. The sentence must be corrected to read '...exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia.' All other aspects of the simplification, including vocabulary and sentence structure, were compliant with the A2 standard, but the factual error is an immediate and total failure."

The original text specifies the event occurred above 'the city of Chelyabinsk'. Your version removes this key fact and replaces it with the generic phrase 'a city in Russia'. This is an unacceptable loss of factual information. While the text passes all metric checks and generally adheres to A2 structure, the factual error is an instant and total failure.
