    "text_translated": "Asteroids are big rocks that fly in space. Now NASA is working to find smaller asteroids. These asteroids are 140 metres wide or more. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 of these asteroids. It found about 8,000. So, there are still 17,000 to find. This is important. In 2013, a small asteroid exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. It was only 19 metres wide. But it hurt 1,200 people. So, these middle-sized asteroids are a very big danger for our world.",
