This failure occurred despite the text passing the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks. The B2 classification is likely due to the consistent use of complex sentence structures. For example, the first sentence, 'Asteroids, which are large rocks that travel through space, are called 'Potentially Hazardous' if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth,' combines a non-defining relative clause with a conditional clause. Similarly, starting the second sentence with 'Although' creates a complex subordinate structure. Suggestion: To meet the B1 requirement, break these longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones. For instance: 'Asteroids are large rocks that travel through space. They are called 'Potentially Hazardous' if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth.' While the text successfully maintained factual accuracy and meaning, the sentence structure must be simplified to achieve the target CEFR level."

Additionally, the output fails on CEFR compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target B1 level. This is likely due to the sentence structure in 'They are called 'Hazardous' if it is possible they will pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth.' Suggestion: Retain the full, correct term and simplify the sentence structure. For example: ''Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are large space rocks.

The simplification of 'Earth's orbit' to 'Earth' is a likely contributor to this low score. While simplifying is the goal, losing such specific terms can reduce fidelity. The submission also failed on CEFR compliance, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the required 'B1'. This is likely due to the retention of the term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', which contains a B2-level adverb, and the use of a conditional clause with a passive voice ('If this happens, two defence solutions could be launched'). On a positive note, the text is factually accurate and successfully preserves the core meaning, as shown by the high MeaningBERT score. The strategy of defining the keyword 'Asteroids' at the beginning was excellent. To improve, consider rephrasing to retain key terms like 'Earth's orbit' and simplifying complex sentence structures to ensure a B1 classification. For example, the last sentence could be split: 'If an impact is predicted, NASA has a plan. They could launch two defence solutions to protect the planet.'"

This loss of specific vocabulary reduced the fidelity score. Additionally, the text fails the CEFR Compliance check, receiving a 'B2' classification instead of the target 'B1'. This is likely due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the sentence 'With the technology it has now, NASA can watch these objects to know if an asteroid might hit Earth, and if they predict an impact, they have two plans to protect us' contains multiple clauses and is too long for a B1 level.

This is a high-quality simplification that is factually correct and preserves the original meaning, passing the first two critical checks. However, it fails on the specific CEFR requirement. The B2 classification is likely due to two factors. First, the retention of the full technical term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' includes the B2-level word 'Potentially', which may have influenced the classifier. Second, the sentence beginning 'With available technology...' uses a fronted prepositional phrase, a structure that can be considered more complex. To correct this, consider defining the difficult word within the term, for example: 'These are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. 'Potentially' means they could be dangerous.' Also, rephrasing the other sentence to 'NASA can use its technology to track these objects...' would simplify the structure."

The combination of these elements probably pushed the automated classifier to a B2 rating. To achieve a B1 classification, consider simplifying one of the key terms. For example, 'defence solutions' could be rephrased as 'ways to protect Earth'. This would reduce the lexical density without losing critical meaning.

A more B1-appropriate structure would use the active voice, for example: 'If that happens, NASA could launch two defence solutions.' Additionally, the sentence 'These are possibly dangerous because they can pass very close to Earth's orbit...' combines a reason clause with specific details, which adds complexity. Despite this, the submission is strong in other areas. Factual integrity is perfect, and the high MeaningBERT (0.93) and BERTScore (0.93) metrics confirm that the core message was preserved.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Integrity. The primary reason for failure is a critical factual error in the first sentence. The original text defines 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' as rocks that are already close enough to pass within a specific distance. The output incorrectly changes this definition, stating they are just 'large rocks in space' that only become a threat if they pass within that distance. This alters the fundamental classification of the objects. The original states: '...rocks close enough to pass within 7.5 million kilometres...'. The output incorrectly states: '...large rocks in space. They are a threat if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres...'. This must be corrected to preserve the original meaning. This error also contributed to a secondary failure. FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8637 is below the required 0.90 threshold, confirming that key lexical details from the original definition were lost. FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', not the target 'B1'. This is likely due to the use of complex sentence structures, such as starting a sentence with a participial phrase ('Using its technology...') and the use of passive voice ('could be launched'), which are too advanced for a B1 level. To fix this, rewrite the definition accurately using simpler, active sentences."

While the vocabulary is appropriate, the sentence length combined with the dense informational phrase 'pass within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth's orbit' likely pushed the classification to B2. Suggestion: To ensure a B1 classification, this sentence could be simplified further, for example: ''Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are rocks that can get very close to Earth. They can pass within 7.5 million kilometres of our planet's path.'

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' target. This is likely due to the high density of B1-level vocabulary (threat, impact, launch, defence) combined with slightly complex phrasing such as 'none of them are expected to be a threat'. While the individual elements are suitable for B1, their concentration in a short text may have pushed the classifier to a higher level. To correct this, consider simplifying one of the phrases. For example, 'none of them are expected to be a threat' could be rephrased as 'NASA does not expect any of them to be a threat'. On a positive note, the simplification is excellent in all other aspects. It is factually accurate, preserves the original meaning perfectly (MeaningBERT 0.94, BERTScore 0.95), and the restructuring of the final sentence into two parts using 'If this happens...' is a model example of good B1 simplification."
