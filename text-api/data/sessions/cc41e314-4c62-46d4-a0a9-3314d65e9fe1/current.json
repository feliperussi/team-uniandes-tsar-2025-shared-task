NASA has created a map of 1,400 of these PHAs. It does not expect any of them to be a threat in the next one hundred years. NASA can use its technology to track these objects and predict a possible impact. If this happens, they could launch two defence solutions.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to the sentence 'These are rocks that can get very close to Earth and pass within 7.5 million kilometres of our planet's path.' This sentence combines a relative clause, a compound verb, and a specific large number, increasing its structural complexity. Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, split this into two simpler sentences. For example: 'These rocks can get very close to Earth. They can pass within 7.5 million kilometres of our planet's path.' On a positive note, the text passed all Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with excellent scores for both MeaningBERT (0.90) and BERTScore (0.93).",
