    "text_translated": "Springsteen is different from many other famous musicians. He is in his late 60s, but he still makes very popular new music. His concerts fill big stadiums. He is still one of the best musicians. This does not surprise me. He tells us the most important stories about our lives. When you listen to his album 'Born in the USA', those stories are still important today.",
