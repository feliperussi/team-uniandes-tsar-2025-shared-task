His concerts fill big stadiums, and he is still one of the best at what he does. This does not surprise me. He tells us the most important stories about our lives. When you listen to his album 'Born in the USA', those stories are still meaningful today.",

The sentence 'His concerts fill big stadiums, and he is still one of the best at what he does' is too long at 17 words. The phrase 'at what he does' is also too complex for the B1 level."
