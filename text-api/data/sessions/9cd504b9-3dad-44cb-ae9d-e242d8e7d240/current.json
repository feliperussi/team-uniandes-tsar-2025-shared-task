    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6825 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The writer's output deviates from the core message of the original text. The original text focuses on the *origin of our capability for complex language* and the *evolutionary aspects* of brain and physical development. The writer's version introduces an unstated concept by adding 'Our language has many words and rules' in the opening, which is a description of language itself, not its evolutionary origin as discussed in the original. This addition shifts the initial semantic focus away from the original's intent. Suggestion: Remove the sentence 'Our language has many words and rules' as it is not present in the original and dilutes the core message about the origin of language capability.",
