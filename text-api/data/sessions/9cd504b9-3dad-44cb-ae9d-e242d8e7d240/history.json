The text fails to preserve the core meaning of the original, particularly regarding the nuanced concepts of linguistic evolution and capability. Specific instances of meaning loss include: 1. The phrase 'capability for complex language' was reduced to 'special language'. This loses the critical concept of 'capability' and the specific 'complexity' of human language development. 2. 'what speech they were capable of making' was simplified to 'their talking'. This removes the specific idea of 'speech capability' which is central to the original's focus on language origins. 3. 'evolved the ability to create complex sounds' was rendered as 'could make many sounds'. This completely omits the evolutionary process ('evolved the ability') and replaces 'complex sounds' with a less specific 'many sounds', thereby losing the essence of how this capacity developed. 4. 'communicated using more basic sounds' was simplified to 'talk with simple sounds'. This loses the broader concept of 'communication' and the comparative aspect implied by 'more basic'. These simplifications, while aiming for A2, strip away too much of the original's specific scientific meaning about the evolution of human linguistic capabilities.",

While the BERTScore of 0.9207 is acceptable, the deeper meaning has been diluted. Specific deviations include: 1. The original text discusses 'capability for complex language', but your version simplifies this to 'good language'. This loses the specific nuance of 'complex' and 'capability', which are central to the scientific inquiry of the original text. 2. The original states 'evolved the ability to create complex sounds', which is simplified to 'learned to make difficult sounds'. 'Learned' does not fully capture the biological, long-term evolutionary development implied by 'evolved the ability'. 3. The original refers to 'evolutionary biologists', which is simplified to 'scientists'. While 'scientists' is A2, 'evolutionary biologists' specifies the relevant field of study, and its removal contributes to the loss of specific meaning regarding the origins of language. Suggestion: To improve meaning preservation, ensure that the concept of 'complex' or 'advanced' language is clearly conveyed, perhaps by using phrases like 'language with many parts' or 'language that is not simple'. For 'evolved the ability', rephrase to reflect a natural, slow change over time, such as 'people's bodies slowly changed to make difficult sounds'. Consider if 'evolutionary biologists' can be simplified while retaining the idea of studying how things change over a very long time.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and specific details. The simplification was too aggressive, sacrificing crucial information. Specific deviations are listed below. \n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text refers to 'our capability for complex language'. Your version simplifies this to 'our language with difficult sounds'. While 'difficult sounds' is an A2 simplification, 'capability' is a key concept that is lost, reducing the nuance of the original statement about human potential. \n- Meaning Loss: The original text specifically mentions 'the development of the mouth, throat and tongue'. Your version simplifies this to 'how the mouth changed. The parts inside the mouth changed too.' The specific anatomical structures 'throat and tongue' are critical for speech development and their omission or vague replacement with 'parts inside the mouth' significantly diminishes the scientific detail and precision of the original message. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to retain the concept of 'capability' for language. Explicitly mention 'throat' and 'tongue' as these are vital for the meaning of the original text, even if simplified to A2 vocabulary. For example, 'how the mouth, throat, and tongue became better for speaking'.",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuance, despite lexical fidelity. The simplification has diluted the meaning. The original text discusses 'capability for complex language' and 'evolved that way' in the context of brain function and evolution. Your version reduces 'capability for complex language' to 'ability to make difficult sounds', which narrows the scope and loses the broader concept of language complexity beyond mere sound production. The phrase 'became like this over a long time' is an overly generic simplification of 'evolved that way', losing the specific biological evolutionary context. These changes, while simplifying vocabulary, compromise the depth of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the concept of 'complex language' (e.g., 'how we can use many words and rules') and 'evolved' (e.g., 'how they slowly changed over time').",

The original text focuses on the *origin of our capability for complex language* and the *evolutionary aspects* of brain and physical development.

This addition shifts the initial semantic focus away from the original's intent.
