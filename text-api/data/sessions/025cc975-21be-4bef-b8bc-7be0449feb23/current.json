Because of this, I don\u2019t waste time commuting or making idle chit\u2011chat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this freedom to choose my hours is very valuable to me because it lets me easily take time off when my children need me at school performances or when I have to schedule a dentist appointment. A problem is that, without clear office hours, I tend to work late into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.97) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message. The text correctly achieves the target B1 classification. The vocabulary strategy is particularly effective; simplifying 'headquarters' to 'main office' and explaining 'flexibility' as 'freedom to choose my hours' are exemplary techniques. For further improvement, consider simplifying the idiomatic phrase 'idle chit-chat'. While many B1 learners might understand it from context, a phrase like 'casual conversation' would be more accessible.",
