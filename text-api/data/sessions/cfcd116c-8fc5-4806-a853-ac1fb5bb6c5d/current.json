However, she understands why people react badly. She didn't like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his rats, and she saw how affectionate and intelligent they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she would like to have two of them.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent submission that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The high MeaningBERT (0.88) and BERTScore (0.98) confirm that the original meaning and key details were successfully preserved. The output correctly achieves a B1 classification. The vocabulary substitutions, such as changing 'fantastic' to 'great' and 'correctly' to 'properly', are well-chosen for the target level. The use of the connector 'However' also improves the flow for a B1 reader. For future improvement, consider replacing the B2-level word 'affectionate' with a more common B1 alternative like 'loving' or 'friendly' to ensure all vocabulary is fully accessible.",
