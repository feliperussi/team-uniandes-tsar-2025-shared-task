This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- Meaning Shift: The original text describes a 'little correlation' between the number of native speakers and learners. Your version states this is 'not very important', which is an oversimplification that changes the meaning. A weak relationship is not the same as a lack of importance.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'native' is B1 level. It is not on the A2 word list. Your attempt to define it does not excuse its use.\n- Structural Violation: The passive voice in 'where a language is spoken' is a B1 grammatical structure. A2 texts must use simple, active sentence structures.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the original meaning of a weak link. Example: 'The number of native speakers does not change the number of learners very much.'\nSuggestion: Replace the passive voice with an active one. Change 'where a language is spoken' to 'in countries where people speak a language'.\nSuggestion: Remove the B1 word 'native'. Use your definition instead.

The original text states Chinese has the 'greatest number of native speakers'. Your text incorrectly states, 'It has the most people who learn it as a child.'

The use of a 'why' clause makes it complex.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. Rephrase to accurately describe 'native speakers' using A2 vocabulary. Example: 'More people speak Chinese from birth than any other language.' Split the long sentences into shorter, simpler ideas. Example: 'Many people speak a language from birth.
