This is likely because the simplification process resulted in a series of short, simple sentences. For example, 'Brains did not suddenly get bigger. However, humans became more complex and intelligent.' While grammatically correct, this structure is more typical of an A2 level. To reach the B1 level, try to combine some of these simple sentences using B1 connectors. For instance, the two sentences could be joined into one: 'Brains did not suddenly get bigger, but humans became more complex and intelligent.' This creates a compound sentence structure that is more appropriate for the target CEFR level. On a positive note, the text successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with excellent BERTScore (0.97) and MeaningBERT (0.95) scores, indicating the core information was retained accurately.",

While the simplification is excellent in terms of factual integrity and meaning preservation (as shown by the high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores), the resulting sentence structures are too simple for the B1 level. The simplification successfully removed complexity but did not retain enough B1-level features. To elevate this text to the target level, consider using slightly more complex connectors or sentence structures. For example, the final sentence could be rephrased to 'It is unclear whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains were the cause of language.' This would raise the grammatical complexity to a B1 standard while maintaining clarity.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the grammatical complexity of the second sentence: 'Although brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent, which raises a question about whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' This single sentence combines a subordinate clause ('Although...'), a non-defining relative clause ('which...'), and an embedded question ('whether...or if...'). This level of syntactic complexity is too high for B1. The original text's structure of shorter sentences and direct questions was more appropriate for the target level. Suggestion: Split the complex sentence into two or three simpler ones to meet the B1 requirement. For example: 'Although brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent. This raises a question: Did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start to produce language?' On a positive note, the submission passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks with excellent scores.",
