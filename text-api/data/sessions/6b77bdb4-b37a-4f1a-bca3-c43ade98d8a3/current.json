    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the grammatical complexity of the second sentence: 'Although brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent, which raises a question about whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' This single sentence combines a subordinate clause ('Although...'), a non-defining relative clause ('which...'), and an embedded question ('whether...or if...'). This level of syntactic complexity is too high for B1. The original text's structure of shorter sentences and direct questions was more appropriate for the target level. Suggestion: Split the complex sentence into two or three simpler ones to meet the B1 requirement. For example: 'Although brains did not suddenly get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent. This raises a question: Did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start to produce language?' On a positive note, the submission passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks with excellent scores.",
