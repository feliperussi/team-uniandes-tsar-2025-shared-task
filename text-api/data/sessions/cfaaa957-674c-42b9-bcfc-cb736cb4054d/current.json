    "text_translated": "It is helpful to know that people can act in different ways. This can help us avoid problems when we communicate. However, we must be careful with stereotypes. Stereotypes are simple and often wrong ideas about a group of people. Using them can be bad for business relationships.\n\nA person's national culture can affect how they act and think. But many other things also shape who we are. For example, the region we come from is important. The groups we are part of also affect us. Our age and gender matter too. Our company's culture and our personal experiences are also important.\n\nSo, we should be aware of these possible differences. But we should not use this knowledge to judge all people from one country.",
