Sentences are too long, such as 'However, it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes can be bad for building good business relationships' (21 words) and 'These things include the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age, and our gender' (20 words). The text also uses undefined B2 vocabulary like 'expectations', 'influence', and 'communities'. These words are not suitable for a B1 learner without explanation."
