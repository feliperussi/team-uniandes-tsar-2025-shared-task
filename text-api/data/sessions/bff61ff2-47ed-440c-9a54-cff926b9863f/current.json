    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8639 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing and lexical detail from the original text, even though the general meaning is preserved.\n\n- The text fails because it oversimplifies the original concepts to a degree that harms fidelity. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are A2 compliant, the translation of ideas is too weak.\n- The original concept of 'sugarcoating the negatives' was reduced to 'hide the negative.' This is an inaccurate simplification. The goal is not to hide, but to make something unpleasant seem more acceptable.\n- The original's 'diminishing its value' became 'not useful anymore.' This is a loss of nuance. The feedback still has a use, but its value or positive impact is reduced, which is a different concept.\n- The original's 'reinforce and encourage good performance' was replaced with 'make good performance stronger.' This is a vague and imprecise substitution for the specific actions of reinforcing and encouraging.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to capture the original's key terms more accurately using A2 vocabulary. Do not replace specific concepts with generic descriptions. To explain 'sugarcoating,' you could write 'employees think the good comments are only there to make the bad comments seem better.' This preserves the meaning with A2 language.",
