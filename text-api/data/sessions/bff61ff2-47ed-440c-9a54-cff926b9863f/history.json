While similar, this substitution reduces the direct lexical link to the source, contributing to the low BERTScore.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase all sentences to use the active voice.

This is a direct result of removing essential keywords from the original text, such as 'feedback', 'employees', 'routine', and 'performance'.\n\n- Meaning Distortion: The original text explains that positive feedback's value is 'diminished' because it is perceived as 'sugarcoating'. Your version, 'workers may think good comments hide bad one', is a less accurate simplification. The problem is not just hiding, but the loss of value for all positive comments.\n\n- Weakened Concept: The original's purpose for positive feedback is to 'reinforce and encourage good performance'. Your version, 'helps the worker keep doing good work', is a much weaker statement and fails to capture the active concept of reinforcement.\n\n- Suggestion: Re-introduce the key term 'feedback'. Rephrase to state that the good feedback loses its meaning or value. Rephrase the final sentences to more strongly express the idea of using good feedback to make good work stronger.",

This is a direct result of using unapproved B1 vocabulary.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The words 'feedback', 'value', and 'encourage' are B1 level. These words are too complex for an A2 audience and must be replaced or defined. The 'Keywords for Definition' list was empty, which is a procedural failure.\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a result of oversimplification. For example, replacing 'diminishing its value' with 'goes down' loses lexical precision.\n\nSuggestion: Replace all B1 vocabulary. Rephrase 'The value of the positive feedback goes down' to 'The good comments are not important anymore'. Rephrase 'It should encourage employees' to 'It should help employees want to do good work'. The core B1 term 'feedback' must be defined in simple A2 terms if it is to be used.",

This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing and lexical detail from the original text, even though the general meaning is preserved.\n\n- The text fails because it oversimplifies the original concepts to a degree that harms fidelity. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are A2 compliant, the translation of ideas is too weak.\n- The original concept of 'sugarcoating the negatives' was reduced to 'hide the negative.' This is an inaccurate simplification. The goal is not to hide, but to make something unpleasant seem more acceptable.\n- The original's 'diminishing its value' became 'not useful anymore.' This is a loss of nuance. The feedback still has a use, but its value or positive impact is reduced, which is a different concept.\n- The original's 'reinforce and encourage good performance' was replaced with 'make good performance stronger.' This is a vague and imprecise substitution for the specific actions of reinforcing and encouraging.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to capture the original's key terms more accurately using A2 vocabulary. Do not replace specific concepts with generic descriptions. To explain 'sugarcoating,' you could write 'employees think the good comments are only there to make the bad comments seem better.' This preserves the meaning with A2 language.",
