Your output completely removes this central point. It presents the story of Theseus in isolation, failing the primary communication goal.\n\n- Meaning Alteration: The original text states the tribute of children was a 'punishment' for the rebellion. Your text changes this to 'As a result'. This is a severe error. 'Punishment' implies a deliberate, cruel penalty, which is central to the parallel with the Hunger Games. 'As a result' is a neutral, weak connector that loses this essential meaning.\n\n- Suggestion: You must restore the original text's primary purpose. The first sentence must establish the link between the myth and its role as an inspiration for the Hunger Games. You must re-introduce the word 'punishment' to accurately convey the reason for the tribute. The text has failed its most basic function: to convey the meaning of the source material.",

The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8625, which is below the 0.90 minimum. The submission is an immediate failure on Priority 2 metrics.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5951 indicates a severe loss of the original message. The original text explains that the youths were 'thrown into the labyrinth', a violent and helpless act. Your version states they 'entered a labyrinth', which completely changes the meaning from a forced sacrifice to a voluntary action. This is an unacceptable alteration of the core narrative.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8625 demonstrates a significant loss of key lexical information. Important concepts like 'important inspiration' and 'classical Greek mythology' were oversimplified, losing fidelity to the source material.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is a direct violation of the core task requirement.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'punishment' was used directly from the original text. This is a clear vocabulary error for an A2 text. The word 'rebelled' is also above the A2 level.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. This destroys the logical flow of the original text (e.g., '...but the Athenians rebel'). While sentences must be simple, they must still connect logically.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text from the beginning. Restore the core meaning of being forcibly 'thrown' into the labyrinth. Replace the B1 word 'punishment' with an A2-level explanation, such as 'Because of this, the king of Crete did something bad to Athens'. Replace 'rebelled' with a simpler phrase like 'fought back'. Use simple A2 connectors like 'but' and 'so' to link ideas instead of creating a list of disconnected facts.",

This is a direct result of replacing precise original phrasing like 'important inspiration' with the overly simplistic 'a big idea', losing lexical fidelity.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is a series of disconnected, choppy sentences. This structure breaks the logical flow of the original narrative, turning a story of cause and effect into a simple list of facts. This contributes directly to the low meaning score.\n\n- Redundancy: You define 'mythology' twice at the beginning of the text.

The original text states the youths were sent 'As a punishment'. Your version only says 'The king made Athens send...', which removes the entire reason for the central conflict.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8709 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming that key lexical items from the original text were lost.\n- The sentence structure is excessively simple, bordering on A1. Multiple sentences can be combined without increasing complexity beyond A2.\nSuggestion: You must reintroduce the concept of 'punishment' to pass. A simple A2 sentence like 'The king was angry and this was a punishment.' is required. Combine the sentences 'The king made Athens send seven boys each year.' and 'He also made them send seven girls each year.' into a single, more natural sentence.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5645 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8731 is also below the 0.90 minimum. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The original text's central point is that the myth was an 'important inspiration'. Your version breaks the text into so many simple, disconnected sentences that this causal link is lost. The core meaning is not preserved.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a result of oversimplification. Key phrases like 'important inspiration', 'Athenians rebel', and 'forces the Athenians' were replaced with phrases that do not carry the same specific meaning, such as 'gave her a big idea' and 'fought the king'.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: You used the word 'punishment', which is a B1-level word. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be at the A2 level or defined in simple A2 terms.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write to establish the connection between the myth and the book idea more clearly. Do not use the B1 word 'punishment'; instead, explain the concept using A2 vocabulary, for example: 'Because the king was angry, he made the people of Athens do something terrible.' The text must be simplified without destroying the original meaning.",
