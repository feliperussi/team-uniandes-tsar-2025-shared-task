    "grade": 1,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5717 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text's central point is that Suzanne Collins' 'love of classical Greek mythology' was the 'inspiration' for the book. Your version loses this core message, reducing it to 'She liked this myth a lot' and 'The myth gave her an important idea'. This is a critical loss of meaning.\n\nAdditional Failures:\n\nFidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8771 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key terms like 'inspiration' and 'classical Greek mythology' were lost, damaging the text's fidelity to the original.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The word 'punishment' is B1 level. It was used directly from the original text without simplification.\n\nVocabulary Violation: The word 'futuristic' is B2 level. It must be removed or rephrased using A2 words, for example, 'a Theseus from the future'.\n\nGrammatical Error: The definition 'Mythology is a name for old the Greek stories' is incorrect. The word order must be 'the old Greek stories'.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to begin with the main idea of inspiration from mythology. Remove the words 'punishment' and 'futuristic'. Replace them with A2-level descriptions. Correct the grammatical error in the definition.",
