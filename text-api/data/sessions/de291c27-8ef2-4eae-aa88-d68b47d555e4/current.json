    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' likely because of long sentences with embedded clauses and complex connectors. For example, the sentence \"NASA is now working to record some of the smaller asteroids, which are space rocks that travel around the Sun, especially those that are 140 metres wide or more.\" contains a parenthetical definition and multiple clauses that exceed B1 complexity. To correct this, split it into shorter sentences and use simpler linking words. Instead of \"For this reason,\" use \"So\" or \"That is why.\" This will reduce syntactic complexity and align the text with the expected B1 level.",
