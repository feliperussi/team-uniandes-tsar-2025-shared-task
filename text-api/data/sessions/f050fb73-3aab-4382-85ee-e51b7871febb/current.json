    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6113 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a loss of the original's nuanced message. The BERTScore of 0.885 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. Specific deviations are listed below. Deviation: Meaning Preservation Failure. The original text emphasizes the 'vital' nature of remembering that stereotypes are 'detrimental' to business relationships. Your version uses 'very important' and 'very bad', which weakens the impact and urgency of the original message. The explanation of 'stereotypes' also shifts focus from their direct negative impact to a definition. Deviation: Lexical Fidelity Failure. Many key terms and phrases from the original have been replaced with overly simplified or less precise language, leading to a low BERTScore. For example: - 'increased awareness' was replaced with 'Knowing more'. - 'cases of miscommunication' was replaced with 'problems when we talk'. - 'vital' was replaced with 'very important'. - 'cultural stereotypes' was replaced with a definition ('Stereotypes are simple ideas about people from a country. These ideas are often not true.') instead of retaining the direct term. - 'detrimental to building good business relationships' was replaced with 'very bad for good business'. - 'largely influenced by' was replaced with 'change us a lot'. - The idiomatic phrase 'keep at the back of our minds' was replaced with 'know about these possible differences. We should remember them.'. - 'pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation' was replaced with 'put all people from one country into a small box.'. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary and the strength of its message, while still adhering to A2 structures. For instance, 'miscommunication' could be simplified to 'not understanding each other' rather than the more general 'problems when we talk'. Ensure that the negative impact of stereotypes is conveyed with appropriate A2-level strength. Aim to achieve a MeaningBERT score of 0.75 or higher and a BERTScore of 0.90 or higher.",
