    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8735 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key descriptive words and phrasing from the original text. The simplification was too aggressive, removing concepts like 'desperation', 'believable', and the intensity of 'absolutely need to call'.\n\n- Fidelity Score Violation: BERTScore is 0.8735, failing to meet the 0.90 minimum for lexical preservation.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'coverage' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary. It must be replaced or simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning to increase the fidelity score. Replace 'coverage' with an A2 phrase such as 'the phone has no signal' or 'the phone cannot connect'.",
