        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The primary failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6933, which is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8716, which is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating an excessive loss of key vocabulary.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure (MeaningBERT): The simplification was too aggressive. The original's concept of 'suspense' is more specific than 'scary feeling'. The phrase 'in desperation' carries a stronger meaning than 'in trouble'. This cumulative loss of nuance resulted in a text that does not adequately represent the original's meaning.\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): Too many key terms were replaced, causing the low score. Words like 'protagonists', 'desperation', 'believable', 'suspense', and 'coverage' were all substituted. While simplification is required, this level of replacement damages lexical fidelity.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase to restore original meaning. The goal is not just simple words, but simple sentences that convey the correct, specific ideas.\n- Suggestion: Instead of 'keep the scary feeling', use a phrase that is closer to the meaning of 'suspense', such as 'make the movie exciting'.\n- Suggestion: Restore some key vocabulary if possible, or find closer A2-level synonyms. The current version has oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7142 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8782 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original message and its specific phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's concept of it being 'difficult or impossible' to call for help was reduced to the absolute 'cannot'. This loses the nuance of the struggle, which is central to the meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key phrases like 'phone coverage' and 'maintain suspense' were replaced with 'phone service' and 'keep the suspense'. While similar, these replacements reduce the lexical fidelity to the source text, contributing to the low BERTScore.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, which is above the A2 target. The sentence 'Or the phone battery dies when you try to call' uses a subordinate time clause ('when you try to call'). This is a B1-level grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Restore the concept of 'difficulty' from the original. Split the sentence containing the 'when' clause into two simple A2 sentences. Example: 'You try to call. Then the phone battery dies.'",

This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and specific phrasing.\n\n- The simplification from 'protagonists were in desperation' to 'a hero in trouble' loses the intensity of the original concept.\n- The phrase 'difficult or impossible' was reduced to 'hard', which fails to capture the full meaning of the original text.\n- The output is a series of disconnected statements. The original text had a more narrative flow which has been lost, contributing to the low meaning preservation score.\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure are compliant with the A2 level, the failure to maintain the original's meaning and fidelity is a critical error.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to better reflect the original's tone. Use simple connectors like 'and' or 'but' to link ideas. Restore the stronger concepts of 'desperation' and 'impossibility' using A2-level vocabulary.",

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: Key concepts were altered. The original's 'maintain suspense' was changed to 'keep the fear'. These are not the same. 'Suspense' is a specific concept that was lost in the simplification.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1. This is due to the use of grammatical structures that are too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- B1 Structure Detected: The sentence 'To keep the fear, the phone does not work' uses an infinitive of purpose at the beginning, which is a B1 characteristic.\n\n- B1 Structure Detected: The sentence 'The phone battery may die just as the hero calls' uses the subordinating conjunction 'just as'. This is a B1-level connector.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to eliminate B1 structures. Replace 'To keep the fear...' with a simple cause-and-effect sentence using 'so'. Example: 'The movie must be scary, so the phone does not work.' Replace 'just as' with a simpler A2 connector like 'when'. Example: '...when the hero calls.'",
