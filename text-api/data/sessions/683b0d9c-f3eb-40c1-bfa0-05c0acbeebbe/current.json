    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7015 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The core message of the original text was not preserved with sufficient accuracy. The primary failure is the substitution of key concepts. The original text discusses brains that 'develop', which implies change and growth. Your text changes this to brains getting 'better', which introduces a judgment not present in the original source and alters the meaning. The original term 'civilisation' was replaced with 'culture'. These words are not interchangeable. This substitution contributes to the overall loss of meaning detected by the metric. Suggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the final questions. Instead of 'make their brains better', use a phrase like 'help their brains to change' or 'make their brains grow'. Rephrase 'human culture' to be more specific, such as 'signs that people started to live together in new ways'.",
