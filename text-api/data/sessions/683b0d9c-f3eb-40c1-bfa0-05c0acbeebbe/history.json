This indicates a minor but critical loss of the original message's nuance. The original text mentions 'early human civilisation' and humans becoming 'more complex'. Your version simplifies this to 'the first people' and 'could do more things'. This simplification was too aggressive and lost a key part of the original meaning, as detected by the metric. While the vocabulary and sentence structure are otherwise compliant with the A2 standard, the failure to preserve the core meaning is a critical error. Suggestion: Rephrase to better capture the concepts of 'civilisation' and 'complexity'. For example, instead of 'the first people', use 'the first groups of people living together'.
