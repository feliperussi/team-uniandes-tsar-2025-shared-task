The phrase 'we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen' was heavily rephrased, leading to a reduction in shared vocabulary.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure and Fidelity Failure. The text fails to accurately preserve the meaning and lexical fidelity of the original. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6184 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.8996 is also below the required 0.90, showing a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations are detailed below. Deviation: The core meaning of 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' is weakened. Your version states 'These dreams are often just a chance. They are usually not messages that tell the future.' This loses the comparative nuance of 'more likely... than'. Deviation: The original phrase 'we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen' is not accurately conveyed. Your version 'We usually forget the dreams that do not happen. We probably only remember the dreams that come true' alters the active choice of forgetting to a passive 'usually forget' and adds an inference about remembering, which is not a direct restatement of the original's emphasis on choice. Deviation: The phrase 'We dream about these things many times' is an addition not present in the original text, introducing new information. Deviation: Key lexical items such as 'prophecy', 'coincidence', 'example', and 'of course' are either omitted or replaced with less precise terms, contributing to the low BERTScore. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly state the comparative likelihood of coincidence over prophecy. Restore the concept of actively choosing to forget. Ensure all core concepts and their nuances are preserved without adding new information.",

The original text conveys a nuanced idea that dreams are 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' and that 'we probably choose to forget' dreams that do not come true. Your version simplifies this to 'often just luck' and 'do not show the future', which loses the comparative aspect and the active choice in forgetting. The BERTScore of 0.8911 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a loss of key lexical detail. For example, 'old friend' is reduced to 'friend', and 'someone close' is not fully captured. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly state that dreams are more often coincidence than prophecy. Rephrase to include the idea that people often choose to forget dreams that do not happen. Ensure key descriptive words like 'old' for friend and 'close' for someone are retained or clearly implied.",
