    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5665 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a nuanced idea that dreams are 'more likely to be the result of coincidence than prophecy' and that 'we probably choose to forget' dreams that do not come true. Your version simplifies this to 'often just luck' and 'do not show the future', which loses the comparative aspect and the active choice in forgetting. The BERTScore of 0.8911 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a loss of key lexical detail. For example, 'old friend' is reduced to 'friend', and 'someone close' is not fully captured. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly state that dreams are more often coincidence than prophecy. Rephrase to include the idea that people often choose to forget dreams that do not happen. Ensure key descriptive words like 'old' for friend and 'close' for someone are retained or clearly implied.",
