    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8469 and BERTScore of 0.9229 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. Complex sentences from the original text have been effectively broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, which is a key strategy for B1 simplification. For example, 'On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style' was simplified to 'Based on what we found, we suggest Girox Foods uses a management style. This style should focus more on people.' This approach significantly improves readability without losing the core message. Vocabulary choices are appropriate for B1, replacing more formal or abstract terms like 'adopt' with 'uses', 'flexible' with 'can change', 'enable' with 'allow', 'reinforcement and recognition' with 'feedback and show that they value', and 'professional development' with 'training for their jobs'. The use of B1 connectors like 'To do this', 'We should also', and 'They should also' helps maintain a smooth flow. The only minor point is the simplification of 'challenge our staff' to 'give our employees interesting tasks', which slightly softens the original intent of 'challenge' but is still a reasonable and positive interpretation for a B1 audience. Overall, this is an excellent simplification.",
