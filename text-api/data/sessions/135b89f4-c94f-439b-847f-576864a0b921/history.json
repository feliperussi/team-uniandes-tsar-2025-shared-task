To do this, we should look into giving our employees working hours that can change, and we should also think about how we can allow them to work from places they choose. Managers need to think about different ways to give our employees interesting tasks, and they should also give more positive feedback and show that they value the work our employees do. Spending more money on training for their jobs, mainly for talking to other people and understanding different cultures, could also help to create a good place for employees to do their best work.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. While the vocabulary has been simplified effectively (e.g., 'professional development' to 'training for their jobs' and 'social and intercultural communication' to 'talking to other people and understanding different cultures'), the primary reason for the B2 classification is the sustained length and complexity of the sentences. For example, the sentence 'To do this, we should look into giving our employees working hours that can change, and we should also think about how we can allow them to work from places they choose.' is 39 words long and contains multiple clauses, making it challenging for a B1 reader. Similarly, 'Managers need to think about different ways to give our employees interesting tasks, and they should also give more positive feedback and show that they value the work our employees do.' (36 words) and 'Spending more money on training for their jobs, mainly for talking to other people and understanding different cultures, could also help to create a good place for employees to do their best work.' (39 words) also exceed typical B1 sentence complexity. To achieve B1, sentences should generally be shorter and contain fewer clauses. We recommend splitting longer sentences into two or more simpler sentences and reducing the number of subordinate clauses within a single sentence.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8469 and BERTScore of 0.9229 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original text. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', meeting the target complexity level. Qualitatively, the simplification is very well executed. Complex sentences from the original text have been effectively broken down into shorter, more manageable sentences, which is a key strategy for B1 simplification. For example, 'On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style' was simplified to 'Based on what we found, we suggest Girox Foods uses a management style. This style should focus more on people.' This approach significantly improves readability without losing the core message. Vocabulary choices are appropriate for B1, replacing more formal or abstract terms like 'adopt' with 'uses', 'flexible' with 'can change', 'enable' with 'allow', 'reinforcement and recognition' with 'feedback and show that they value', and 'professional development' with 'training for their jobs'. The use of B1 connectors like 'To do this', 'We should also', and 'They should also' helps maintain a smooth flow. The only minor point is the simplification of 'challenge our staff' to 'give our employees interesting tasks', which slightly softens the original intent of 'challenge' but is still a reasonable and positive interpretation for a B1 audience. Overall, this is an excellent simplification.",
