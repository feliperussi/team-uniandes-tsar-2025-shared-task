    "text_translated": "The Scallion is a weekly newspaper which is given out for free in university buildings and is read by about 10,000 students. It is written and produced completely by students. A survey shows that students and staff find the newspaper very valuable for entertainment, learning about culture, and getting work experience.\n\nThe cost of printing the newspaper is high. Also, some students cannot get the paper easily, because the only way to get a copy is to go to the university in person. Another problem for the environment is that many copies become rubbish on the campus.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that successfully passes all evaluation priorities. Factual Integrity: The output is perfectly accurate, correctly reporting the newspaper's name, readership numbers, and the key issues identified in the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics confirm the high quality, with a MeaningBERT of 0.75 and a BERTScore of 0.95, both meeting the required thresholds. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. Qualitative Analysis: The vocabulary strategy is excellent. Complex concepts like 'cultural enrichment' were skillfully simplified to 'learning about culture', and 'significant cost' became 'high cost'. The sentence structure is clear, and the use of connectors like 'Also' and 'because' creates a fluent and easy-to-read text. This is a model B1 simplification with no recommended changes.",
