        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8764 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates that your version loses important lexical detail from key phrases like 'the death of someone close' and 'we probably choose to forget all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen.' Instead, the simplification to 'we forget many dreams that do not happen' is too vague and omits the conditional nuance of 'all the times we dream about such events but they don't happen.' Although MeaningBERT passes at 0.7897, BERTScore failure shows critical loss of original wording fidelity. Furthermore, the word 'coincidence' is labeled as B2 vocabulary and should have been replaced or simplified, but the output retains it directly. This violates the vocabulary requirement for A2, which demands simpler synonyms. CEFR classifier was correct at A2 level, but vocabulary misuse and BERTScore breach enforces failure. Suggestion: Replace 'coincidence' with 'chance' or a simpler phrase. Rephrase the second sentence to include the idea that many dreams that do not come true are forgotten, preserving the original conditional meaning. Increase lexical fidelity by including more original expressions while keeping sentence structures simple and vocabulary within A2 limits.",
