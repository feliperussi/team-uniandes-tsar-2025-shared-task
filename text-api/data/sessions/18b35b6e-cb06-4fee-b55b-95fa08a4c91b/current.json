    "text_translated": "Are things bad every day? Is progress impossible?\nSteven Pinker wrote a book. Its name is 'Enlightenment Now'.\nHe looks at the big picture of human progress. Progress is when things get better. He finds good news.\nWe live longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives.\n\nBut Pinker says there is a real problem. Enlightenment was a time when people started to think in new ways.\nThe ideas of reason and science from Enlightenment are in danger. Reason is good thinking. Science is studying facts.\n\nSome people talk on TV or radio. Some bad leaders make people angry.\nThese people talk to others. They make people only like their own group. They make people think nothing can change. They make people not trust others.\n\nThen we are in danger. We can cause problems that we cannot fix.\nThese problems can hurt important groups. These groups help people choose their leaders. These groups help countries work together.",

    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to meet the required metrics for meaning preservation and lexical fidelity.  MeaningBERT score of 0.7358 is below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a stronger sense of urgency and threat regarding 'Enlightenment values... under attack' and 'irreparable damage'. Your version, with phrases like 'in danger' and 'problems that we cannot fix', softens this critical aspect of the core message. BERTScore of 0.8897 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. While simplification for A2 is necessary, the replacements for terms like 'commentators and demagogues' and 'tribalism, fatalism and distrust' resulted in too much lexical deviation from the source.  Additionally, the word 'trust' in the sentence 'They make people not trust others' is classified as a B1 vocabulary item and is not appropriate for an A2 text.  Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to more accurately reflect the original's intensity and specific threats. Find closer A2 synonyms for key terms to improve lexical overlap. Replace 'trust' with a simpler A2 phrase, such as 'believe in others' or 'think others are good'.",
