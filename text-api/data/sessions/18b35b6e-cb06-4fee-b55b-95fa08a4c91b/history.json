The BERTScore of 0.8663 is below the required 0.90, showing a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- The original text's emphasis on 'the big picture of human progress' is diluted to 'how people live' and 'things are getting better', losing the scope and specific concept of 'human progress'.\n- The critical concept of 'Enlightenment values... under attack' is weakened to 'ideas from the Enlightenment are in danger', which is less precise and urgent than 'under attack'.\n- The specific and nuanced concepts of 'commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust' are oversimplified to 'Some people talk badly. They make people angry. They make people not trust others.' This completely omits the key actors 'commentators' and 'demagogues', and the crucial concepts of 'tribalism' and 'fatalism', which are central to the original argument's problem statement.\n- The severity of 'irreparable damage to important institutions' is reduced to 'hurt important things' and 'big problems', losing the gravity and permanence implied by 'irreparable damage' and the formal nature of 'institutions'.\n- The term 'world co-operation' is simplified to 'when countries work together', which is less formal and precise, losing some of the original's lexical detail.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Reintroduce the concept of 'overall progress' or 'how humans are doing in general' to maintain the original scope of 'big picture of human progress'.\n- Suggestion: Strengthen the language around the 'attack' on Enlightenment values to reflect the original's urgency, perhaps using 'are being hurt' or 'are in danger from bad people'.\n- Suggestion: Find A2-appropriate ways to convey the concepts of 'tribalism' and 'fatalism' or acknowledge their omission if they cannot be simplified without losing core meaning. Do not simply remove them. For example, 'people only care about their own group' for tribalism. Ensure the actors 'commentators' and 'demagogues' are represented, even if simplified to 'some speakers' or 'some leaders'.\n- Suggestion: Use stronger A2 vocabulary to convey 'irreparable damage' such as 'very bad damage that cannot be fixed' or 'damage that stays forever' to maintain the original's severity.\n- Suggestion: Use 'countries working together' or 'countries helping each other' to better reflect 'world co-operation'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning and Fidelity Failure. The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, as evidenced by the low metric scores. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6643 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original message's nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8646 is below the required 0.90, showing a substantial deviation in key words and factual phrasing. Specific deviations include: 1. MeaningBERT Failure: The original text emphasizes that 'Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack' and that 'commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust'. Your version simplifies this to 'bad people are hurting the ideas from the Enlightenment' and 'Some leaders and speakers talk badly. They make people only care about their own group. They make people think nothing can get better. They make people not trust others.' This simplification loses the specific, active nature of the 'attack' and the nuanced 'appeal' to negative human traits, diluting the core warning. 2. BERTScore Failure: Key phrases and vocabulary from the original were not adequately preserved. For example, 'big picture of human progress' was simplified to 'how all humans are doing', losing the 'big picture' concept. 'Enlightenment values' was reduced to 'ideas from the Enlightenment'. 'Commentators and demagogues' became 'Some leaders and speakers', losing the specific connotations of the original terms. 'Tribalism, fatalism and distrust' were broken down into descriptive sentences, losing the concise and impactful original terms. 'Irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation' was simplified, losing 'important institutions' and the specific phrasing of 'world co-operation'. 3. Unnecessary Additions: The definitions of 'Progress', 'The Enlightenment', and 'A democracy' at the beginning and within the text, while helpful for A2, are additions not present in the original narrative flow. While keywords can be defined, these additions contribute to the BERTScore deviation as they are not direct simplifications of existing phrases within the original text's structure. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific concepts of 'values under attack' and the 'appeal' to negative human traits. Ensure key terms like 'institutions' and 'world co-operation' are preserved or simplified with closer lexical equivalents. Integrate definitions more subtly or ensure they are direct simplifications of terms used in the original text, rather than standalone additions.",

For example, 'world co-operation' was replaced with 'when countries work together', and 'appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust' was rephrased as 'make people feel tribalism... fatalism... not trust others'. While the meaning is preserved, the specific lexical detail required for a high BERTScore is lost due to over-simplification and extensive rephrasing. Additionally, the text failed the CEFR Compliance Check. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is due to the presence of B1-level grammatical structures and vocabulary. Specific deviations: - Vocabulary: The text contains numerous words above the A2 level, even when definitions are provided. Examples include 'values', 'reason', 'science', 'commentators', 'demagogues', 'tribalism', 'fatalism', 'irreparable', 'damage', 'institutions', and 'democracy'. For A2, these words must be avoided or replaced with simpler A1/A2 equivalents. - Sentence Structure: Several sentences use B1-level relative clauses. For example, 'Commentators are people who talk about news.', 'Demagogues are leaders who make people angry to get power.', 'Tribalism means people only care about their own group.', and 'A democracy is when people choose their leaders.' These structures are too complex for A2. The sentence 'The Enlightenment was a time when people started to think more about science and reason.' is also too long and complex for A2. - Over-explanation: While definitions are helpful, the sheer volume of definitions and the way they are integrated disrupt the flow and contribute to the BERTScore reduction by adding content not directly from the original. Suggestion: Focus on using only A1/A2 vocabulary. Break down sentences with relative clauses into two simpler sentences. Rephrase complex concepts using only basic sentence structures and common A1/A2 words. Ensure that key terms from the original are retained where possible, or replaced with very close A2 synonyms, rather than extensive rephrasing.",

The extensive breakdown and rephrasing of terms like 'irreparable damage' and 'important institutions like democracy and world co-operation' into multiple sentences, while providing definitions, deviates too much from the original's specific wording and structure, leading to the lower BERTScore.

The phrase 'the big picture of human progress' was simplified to 'human progress', losing the specific nuance of 'big picture'. 2. 'Pinker argues' was replaced with 'Pinker says', which is a less precise verb. 3. The passive structure 'are under attack' was changed to the active 'People are attacking', altering the original phrasing. 4. 'appeal to people's tribalism' was rephrased as 'These people use tribalism', losing the specific verb 'appeal to'. 5. The phrase 'in danger of causing irreparable damage' was broken down and rephrased as 'can cause damage that cannot be fixed. It can hurt important institutions', losing the specific lexical item 'irreparable' and the construction 'in danger of causing'. Suggestion: While simplifying for A2, ensure that core lexical items and specific phrasings are retained as much as possible, or replaced with very close A2 synonyms, to maintain a higher fidelity score.

The extensive rephrasing and definition of terms, while aiming for simplicity, significantly reduced the lexical overlap with the original text. For instance, 'irreparable damage' was replaced with 'damage that we cannot fix', and 'commentators' was replaced with 'Some people talk on TV or radio'. This deviation from the original phrasing caused the BERTScore to fall below the acceptable threshold. FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is a direct consequence of the vocabulary used. Specific deviations from A2 standard include: 1. Vocabulary: The word 'means' is used multiple times (e.g., 'Progress means things get better', 'Democracy means people choose their leaders'). This word is classified as B2 in the provided vocabulary list and is too complex for A2. 2. Vocabulary: The words 'damage', 'democracy', 'co-operation', 'institutions', 'values', 'tribalism', 'fatalism', and 'distrust' are B1 level vocabulary. Even with definitions provided, their initial presence in the text (e.g., 'cause damage', 'like democracy', 'world co-operation', 'important institutions', 'Enlightenment values', 'people's tribalism') elevates the text beyond A2. The rule is to avoid such words entirely for A2. Corrective Action Required: 1. Rephrase all instances of 'means' using simpler A1/A2 structures such as 'is' or 'is when'. 2. Eliminate all B1/B2 vocabulary. This includes 'damage', 'democracy', 'co-operation', 'institutions', 'values', 'tribalism', 'fatalism', and 'distrust'. Describe these concepts using only A1/A2 words, even if it requires more descriptive phrasing. For example, instead of 'democracy', describe 'a way where people choose their leaders' without using the B1 term. 3. Review all rephrased sections to ensure higher lexical fidelity to the original text while maintaining A2 simplicity to improve the BERTScore.",
