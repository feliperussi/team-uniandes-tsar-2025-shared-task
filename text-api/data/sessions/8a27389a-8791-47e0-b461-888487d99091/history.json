The text failed to preserve the core meaning and lexical fidelity of the original text, as indicated by the low MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics. \n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6774 is below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the political nature of some street art is diluted. The original text's 'make political points' is simplified to 'talk about important ideas'. While 'important ideas' is an A2 phrase, it loses the specific nuance of social or governmental commentary inherent in 'political points'.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8849 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original. For example, 'explosion in street art' was replaced with 'street art also grew a lot', 'political points' with 'important ideas', 'inequality' with 'unfairness', and 'discrimination' with 'treating people badly'. While these are A2 simplifications, they collectively reduce the lexical overlap and semantic precision required for a high BERTScore.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- To improve meaning preservation, rephrase 'talk about important ideas' to more accurately reflect the 'political points' aspect, perhaps by stating 'art about problems in the world' or 'art about how people live together'.\n- To improve lexical fidelity, review the simplified phrases. For instance, 'explosion in street art' could be rephrased as 'street art became very popular quickly' or 'street art grew very fast'. Ensure that the definitions provided for 'unfairness' and 'treating people badly' are concise and do not inadvertently dilute the original concepts of 'inequality' and 'discrimination' when compared by the BERT model.",

BERTScore-Orig Score: The score of 0.887 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. The primary reason for the low scores is the inclusion of definitions for 'graffiti' and 'street art' at the beginning of the output.

Their inclusion dilutes the semantic similarity and lexical overlap when comparing the output strictly against the original content, which is what MeaningBERT-Orig and BERTScore-Orig measure. Suggestion: To improve these scores, strictly adhere to the content of the original text. Do not introduce new information, such as definitions, that is not present in the source material when the primary goal is to preserve the original message and lexical fidelity.

While all factual elements are present, the core message and emphasis of the original text have been slightly diluted. This is primarily due to excessive fragmentation of ideas into very short, disconnected sentences. For instance, the original's 'produced art that tried to make people think about war, inequality and discrimination' is broken into multiple sentences, listing topics and then adding 'They wanted people to think about these things' as a separate, less impactful statement. This weakens the direct link between the art's creation and its intended purpose. Similarly, the original's concise flow of 'graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art' is fragmented into three separate sentences, reducing the impact of the simultaneous growth and the 'explosion' concept. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to maintain a stronger, more direct connection between actions and their purpose. Combine closely related ideas into single, simple A2 sentences where appropriate to preserve the original's emphasis and flow without oversimplifying to the point of dilution.",

The text loses some lexical fidelity by replacing key phrases with overly simplified or different phrasing, such as 'explosion' with 'grew very big and very fast', 'political points' with 'big problems', 'inequality' with 'when people are not the same', and 'discrimination' with 'when people are treated badly'. While these changes aim for simplicity, they reduce the direct lexical overlap with the original text, causing the BERTScore to fall below the acceptable threshold. To pass, the lexical fidelity must be maintained more closely to the original phrasing while still adhering to A2 simplicity.",

While the CEFR classifier rated the overall text as A2, the qualitative audit specifically identifies and fails any unapproved B1/B2 vocabulary. \n\nDeviation: \n- The word 'politics' is used in the sentence 'Some artists made art about politics.' This word is a B1 level vocabulary item and is not appropriate for an A2 text. \n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence to avoid B1 vocabulary. For example, 'Some artists made art about how countries are run' or 'Some artists made art about important ideas for a country'.",
