This is a critical deviation. The sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2. However, the following specific issues were identified: The word 'riots' is a B1-level vocabulary item. An A2 simplification would be 'big fights' or 'trouble in the city'. The acronym 'CCTV' is not typically A2. A simpler explanation like 'camera videos' or 'security camera films' would be more appropriate. Suggestion: Replace 'riots' with a simpler A2 phrase. Rephrase 'CCTV videos' to avoid the acronym and use more common A2 terms.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8524 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9193 exceeds the 0.90 requirement, demonstrating strong lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2, confirming its appropriate linguistic complexity. The vocabulary used is entirely within the A2 level, with no unapproved B1/B2 words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are appropriately limited to A1/A2 level usage ('But').",
