Factual integrity is maintained, with no discrepancies found when comparing the writer's output to the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8524 is well above the 0.75 threshold, indicating excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9193 exceeds the 0.90 requirement, demonstrating strong lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2, confirming its appropriate linguistic complexity. The vocabulary used is entirely within the A2 level, with no unapproved B1/B2 words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are appropriately limited to A1/A2 level usage ('But').",
