    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8951 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore is too low. The replacement of 'what we ask machines to do' with 'the jobs we give robots' is an example of lost lexical detail that caused this score reduction.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, which is an instant failure. The A2 standard was not met.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words that are not on the A2 list. 'Campaign' (B1), 'military' (B1), and 'murder' (B1) are all above the required level. These words must be replaced with simpler A2 alternatives.\n\nSuggestion: Replace all B1-level vocabulary immediately. 'Campaign' must become 'group'. 'Military' must become 'army' or 'for war'. 'Murder' must become 'kill'. Rephrase sentences to stay closer to the original's specific terms to meet the BERTScore requirement.",
