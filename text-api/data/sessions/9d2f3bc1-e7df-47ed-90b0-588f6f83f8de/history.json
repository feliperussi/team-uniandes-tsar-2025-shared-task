The specific name 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots' was reduced to 'a group'. The concept of 'autonomous' robots was inadequately translated as 'robots that move by themselves', losing the core idea of independent decision-making. This loss of specific nouns and adjectives is the direct cause of the low BERTScore.\n- Structural Oversimplification: The text is a series of short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure ('This is clear. It is wrong. It is very dangerous...') is more characteristic of A1 than A2. A2 level requires the ability to link simple ideas using basic connectors.\n- Meaning Nuance Lost: The original text's sense of urgency and ethical argument ('unethical', 'cautious indeed') is weakened by reduction to basic words like 'wrong' and 'careful'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key proper nouns and technical concepts from the original. Simplify them, but do not remove them entirely. Combine the extremely short sentences using A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', or 'so' to create a more coherent text.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance Failure. The primary objective was to produce an A2 text, but the output was classified as B1. This is an immediate failure. The text also fails on lexical fidelity.\n\n- CEFR Violation (Vocabulary): The text uses multiple words above the A2 level, which caused the B1 classification. The words 'campaign' (B1), 'military' (B1), 'autonomous' (B2), and 'unethical' (B2) are not A2 vocabulary. These words must be replaced or defined in simple terms.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8881 is below the required minimum of 0.90. This indicates that key words and phrasing from the original text were lost during simplification, reducing the text's fidelity.\n\n- Structural Issue: The sentence 'They follow orders but they decide who to kill' is acceptable, but could be clearer by splitting it: 'They follow orders. But they decide who to kill.' This improves readability for an A2 audience.\n\nSuggestion: Remove all vocabulary above the A2 level. Replace 'campaign' with 'group'. Replace 'military' with 'army'. Replace 'autonomous robots' with a simple description like 'robots that think for themselves'. Replace 'unethical' with 'wrong' or 'very bad'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8675 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a significant loss of key phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Dilution: The original text's warning about something being 'completely unethical and dangerous for humanity' was reduced to 'very bad for all people'. This simplification loses the specific concepts of morality ('unethical') and severe risk ('dangerous'), which are central to the author's argument.\n- Factual Oversimplification: The specific name 'Campaign to Stop Killer Robots' was replaced with the generic 'a group'. This removes an important piece of information and reduces fidelity.\n- Structural Choppiness: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text sound unnatural and simplistic even for an A2 level, contributing to the loss of the original's coherent argument.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning. The concept of 'unethical' must be rephrased more accurately, for example, as 'This is wrong and dangerous for people'. Combine some of the short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' to improve the flow. For example: 'Today the army uses robots such as drones, guns, and sentry robots, and they can kill people with very little human help.'",
