    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5767 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. The text fails to preserve the core message and relationships between ideas present in the original.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The low MeaningBERT score is a direct result of breaking the original text into disconnected, overly simplistic sentences. For example, the original links the value of the paper to three reasons; your version lists them as separate, unrelated facts. Key information, such as the paper also being valued by 'staff', was completely omitted.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8769 is below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects a loss of important factual words. Key terms like 'faculty buildings', 'highly valued', and 'cultural enrichment' were replaced with less precise A2 alternatives, damaging the text's fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'printing', 'litter', and 'campus'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard and must be replaced.\n\n- Structural Violation: The final sentence, 'Many copies become litter on the campus, a problem for the environment,' uses a complex appositive phrase. This is not an A2 structure. It must be broken into two simple sentences.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the omitted fact about 'staff'. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'because' to link related ideas instead of presenting them as a disconnected list. Replace the B1 vocabulary: 'printing' with 'to print', 'litter' with 'trash', and 'campus' with 'university grounds'. Split the final sentence into two simple sentences.",
