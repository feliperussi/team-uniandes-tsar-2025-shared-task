The text has failed at a primary diagnostic stage.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6063 indicates a severe loss of the original message. Your simplification of 'highly valued' to 'like it a lot' and 'cultural enrichment' to 'learning' strips the text of its core meaning. The concept of an 'environmental issue' was completely removed.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8817 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is a direct result of replacing specific, factual words like 'distributed', 'faculty buildings', 'significant', and 'litter' with overly simple substitutes.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 words 'printing' and 'campus'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard and must be replaced.\n\n- Structural Error: The sentence 'Because you have to go to the university to get a copy.' is a sentence fragment. This is a grammatical failure. It must be connected to the previous clause.\n\n- Structural Error: The connector 'More' is used incorrectly to start the final sentence. This is not standard A2 usage.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to restore the original meaning. Re-introduce the concepts of value, culture, and environmental problems using simple A2 language. Replace all B1 vocabulary. Correct the sentence fragment by joining the clauses with 'because'. Replace the incorrect connector 'More' with 'Also'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The text fails on two critical metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5439 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original message's core meaning. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8554 is below the 0.90 minimum, showing a significant loss of key vocabulary and phrasing.\n\n- Meaning Destruction: The original text states students and staff value the paper for three specific reasons in one cohesive sentence. Your output breaks this single idea into five disconnected, simplistic sentences. This fragmentation destroys the relationship between the concepts and is the primary reason for the abysmal MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key B1 concepts like 'cultural enrichment' and 'environmental issue' were replaced with overly simplistic A2 phrases like 'learn new things about culture' and 'The trash hurts nature'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the precision of the original text, causing the low BERTScore.\n\n- Factual/Structural Error: The sentence 'They like it for work practice?' incorrectly ends with a question mark. The original text makes a definitive statement. Your version introduces uncertainty, which is a factual misrepresentation.\n\n- Over-simplification: The output is a list of choppy, disconnected facts rather than a coherent paragraph. While the CEFR classifier rated it A2, this was achieved by sacrificing essential meaning and flow, which is an unacceptable trade-off.\n\nSuggestion: Recombine the fragmented sentences. Use simple A2 connectors like 'and' to link related ideas. For example: 'A survey shows students and staff think the paper is important for fun, to learn about culture, and for work practice.' Remove the question mark. Restore more precise meaning without using B1 vocabulary. For example, rephrase 'The trash hurts nature' to 'The trash is an environmental problem on campus.'",

Your version, 'very useful', fails to capture the same level of importance and respect. The simplification from 'environmental issue' to 'problem for nature' is too vague and loses the specific context.\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is low because key terms from the original text like 'significant', 'distributed', and 'litter' were completely removed instead of being simplified, resulting in a loss of lexical detail.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'entertainment' and 'campus'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: You must rephrase sentences to better capture the original meaning using A2 vocabulary.

'Environmental issue' was reduced to 'problem for nature'.

This destroyed the logical flow that connected the problems of cost, access, and litter in the original text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by rephrasing concepts more accurately. Use 'think the paper is important' instead of 'value'. Use 'bad for the environment' instead of 'problem for nature'. Replace the word 'campus' with an A2 alternative like 'university grounds'.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message.\n\n- The primary failure is the translation of the original's \"highly valued\" to your version's \"needed\". These words have different meanings. \"Valued\" means people like and appreciate it. \"Needed\" means it is a requirement. This alters the central point about the newspaper's reception.\n- The BERTScore of 0.8859 is also below the minimum of 0.90. This reflects a loss of key vocabulary. Phrases like \"highly valued\" and \"cultural enrichment\" were replaced with words that do not carry the same weight or meaning.\n- The phrase \"gives culture ideas\" is a poor simplification of \"cultural enrichment\". It is vague and loses the concept of personal development.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to preserve the original meaning. Do not change the core concepts. To fix the meaning of \"highly valued\", use a phrase like \"students and staff like the paper very much\". To fix \"cultural enrichment\", use a phrase like \"it helps them learn about culture\". The text must be simple but accurate.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5742 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The text was oversimplified to the point of losing the original's core logic and connections between ideas. A secondary failure was detected in lexical fidelity, with a BERTScore of 0.8726 falling below the 0.90 minimum.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text states the survey shows the paper is valued FOR entertainment, enrichment, and experience. Your version breaks this causal link. You state that a survey shows people like the paper, and then add, as separate facts, 'They say it is fun. It helps them learn about culture.' This severs the logical connection present in the original source and is the primary reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is too low because key phrases were replaced with overly simplistic terms. 'An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus' was reduced to 'Many copies become trash on the university grounds. This is bad for the environment.' This two-sentence simplification loses the specific concepts of 'environmental issue' and 'litter on campus', damaging fidelity.\n\n- Nuance Loss: The original states 'the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university'. Your version, 'They must go to the university,' loses the critical nuance that there are no other options. This changes the meaning from a limitation to a simple requirement.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the logical links from the original text. The sentence about the survey must directly contain the reasons for the paper's value. Rephrase the sentence about the environmental problem to be a single statement that connects the trash directly to the issue, using vocabulary closer to the original like 'campus' and 'problem for the environment'.",

The text fails to preserve the core message and relationships between ideas present in the original.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The low MeaningBERT score is a direct result of breaking the original text into disconnected, overly simplistic sentences.

Key information, such as the paper also being valued by 'staff', was completely omitted.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8769 is below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects a loss of important factual words. Key terms like 'faculty buildings', 'highly valued', and 'cultural enrichment' were replaced with less precise A2 alternatives, damaging the text's fidelity.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1-level words 'printing', 'litter', and 'campus'. These are not compliant with the A2 standard and must be replaced.\n\n- Structural Violation: The final sentence, 'Many copies become litter on the campus, a problem for the environment,' uses a complex appositive phrase.
