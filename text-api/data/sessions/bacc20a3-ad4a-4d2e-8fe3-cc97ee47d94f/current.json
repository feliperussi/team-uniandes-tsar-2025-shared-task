    "text_translated": "Two big studies were done around the world. One study, by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), collected answers from more than 40,000 people. These people included `millennials`, who are people born between 1983 and 1993, and also people who were not millennials. This study asked about many topics, such as the culture in the place of work, how people talk to each other, different ways of working, how people get paid, how they can grow in their jobs, and how they find a good balance between work and life. In addition, a different study, done by Deloitte, asked more than 10,000 millennials about their ideas on the dangers and chances for success in the difficult world of work.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all evaluation criteria. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all numbers, names, and relationships accurately transferred from the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8373 and BERTScore of 0.9154 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of core meaning and lexical fidelity. Furthermore, the text is accurately classified as B1 CEFR compliant. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary and sentence structures. For instance, 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities' was clearly and accurately simplified to 'ideas on the dangers and chances for success,' and 'complex world of work' became 'difficult world of work.' The keyword 'millennial' was expertly defined in-line using a relative clause ('millennials, who are people born between 1983 and 1993'), which is an ideal B1 strategy. The use of the B1 connector 'In addition' also contributes to a smooth and logical flow between ideas. The text demonstrates strong adherence to B1 principles, making it highly accessible without losing any essential information.",
