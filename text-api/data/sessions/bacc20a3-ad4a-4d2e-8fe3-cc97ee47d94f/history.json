These people included `millennials`, who are people born between 1983 and 1993, and also people who were not millennials. This study asked about many topics, such as the culture in the place of work, how people talk to each other, different ways of working, how people get paid, how they can grow in their jobs, and how they find a good balance between work and life. In addition, a different study, done by Deloitte, asked more than 10,000 millennials about their ideas on the good and bad things in the difficult world of work.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6691 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message, particularly in the second part of the simplification. The original text refers to 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work.' The simplified output, 'their ideas on the good and bad things in the difficult world of work,' loses the specific nuance of 'threats and opportunities' which implies a more strategic or analytical viewpoint, replacing it with a more generic 'good and bad things.' This change alters the specific focus of the Deloitte study. To improve, consider retaining more of the original meaning for 'threats and opportunities' or finding a closer B1 equivalent that conveys the strategic aspect, such as 'dangers and chances for success' or 'problems and possibilities for growth'.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all numbers, names, and relationships accurately transferred from the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8373 and BERTScore of 0.9154 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of core meaning and lexical fidelity. Furthermore, the text is accurately classified as B1 CEFR compliant. The writer effectively simplified complex vocabulary and sentence structures. For instance, 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities' was clearly and accurately simplified to 'ideas on the dangers and chances for success,' and 'complex world of work' became 'difficult world of work.' The keyword 'millennial' was expertly defined in-line using a relative clause ('millennials, who are people born between 1983 and 1993'), which is an ideal B1 strategy. The use of the B1 connector 'In addition' also contributes to a smooth and logical flow between ideas. The text demonstrates strong adherence to B1 principles, making it highly accessible without losing any essential information.",
