We should not use stereotypes. Stereotypes are simple, and often wrong, ideas about a group of people. Using stereotypes is bad for making good business relationships. The culture of a country can change how we act and think. But many other things also change us. The area we come from is important. The people we are with are important. Our age and if we are a man or a woman is important. Our company's culture and our life experiences are also important. So, we should remember that people can be different.

The goal is to use vocabulary the A2 learner already possesses, not to introduce new terms beyond the allowed keywords. The presence of these B1 words makes the text unacceptable."
