    "text_translated": "It is good to know that people can act in different ways. This helps us talk to people without problems. But it is very important to remember one thing. We should not use stereotypes. Stereotypes are simple, and often wrong, ideas about a group of people. Using stereotypes is bad for working well with people in business. The culture of a country can change how we act and think. But many other things also change us. The area we come from is important. The people we are with are important. Our age and if we are a man or a woman is important. Our company's culture and the things that happen in our life are also important. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we should not use this idea to think that all people from one country are the same.",
