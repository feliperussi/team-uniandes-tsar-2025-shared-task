Key entities (George Lucas, Luke, Princess Leia, R2D2) and events (finding the message) are accurately represented.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The metrics are well above the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.8589 and BERTScore at 0.9157 confirm that the core message and key lexical items have been preserved with high fidelity.\n- CEFR Compliance: The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms this classification.\n- Structural Analysis: The text is correctly structured for the A2 level. It exclusively uses short, simple sentences. Complex clauses from the original have been successfully broken down into individual statements.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. The B1 word 'Princess' is deemed acceptable as it functions as part of a proper name (Princess Leia) and is a high-frequency word in the context of stories. The keyword 'hero's journey' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms at the start of the text. No corrective action is required.",

Your output omits this key fact, stating only that the message is 'from Princess Leia'. This is a failure to preserve the core information of the source text.\n- Deviation: Factual omission. The recipient of the message, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is a critical detail that has been removed. This alters the core facts of the example provided.\n- Deviation: B1 Vocabulary. The word 'princess' is not on the A2 word list. While it is part of a proper name, its use is a violation of the A2 vocabulary standard.\nSuggestion: Restore the fact that the message was for Obi-Wan Kenobi. The sentence must be factually complete. Replace 'Princess Leia' with just 'Leia' to adhere to the A2 vocabulary list.",
