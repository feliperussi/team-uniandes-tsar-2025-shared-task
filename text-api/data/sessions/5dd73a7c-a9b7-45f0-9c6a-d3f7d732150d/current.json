    "feedback": "The submission is approved with a high grade. It successfully passed all priority checks. Factual Integrity: All key details from the original text were preserved accurately. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key terms were maintained. CEFR Compliance: The output correctly achieved the target B1 level. The simplification strategy was highly effective. Specifically, the decision to split the original's long, complex sentences into shorter, more direct ones greatly improved readability. For example, breaking down the sentence about the selection and the battle into two separate thoughts was an excellent choice for a B1 audience. The vocabulary simplification, such as changing 'is forced to watch' to 'must watch', was also well-executed.",
