She asked about how she led them. Her team was happy she asked. They said they did not know this way to work. This was their normal way of working. They liked to make their own plans. They liked to have creative freedom. Gabriela told them exactly what to do. They felt she did not believe in them. They saw Gabriela felt bad. This was when they tried to say no to her decisions. Or when they tried to change her decisions. They could explain this. They always worked like this.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully adheres to the CEFR A2 standard across all diagnostic priorities. Factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning and fidelity to the original text are preserved, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.7791 and BERTScore of 0.9049, both meeting the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms the use of appropriate A1/A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. The text effectively breaks down complex ideas into short, direct sentences, using basic connectors like 'and' (implied) and 'when'. The simplification of 'not used to being told what to do' to 'did not know this way to work. This was their normal way of working' is an effective A2 rephrasing. The phrase 'Or when they tried to change her decisions' as a separate sentence is slightly clunky but maintains simplicity, which is acceptable for A2.",
