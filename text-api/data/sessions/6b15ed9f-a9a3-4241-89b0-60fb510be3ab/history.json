The simplification dilutes critical aspects of the narrative. \n*   The original phrase 'Gabriela was taking it personally' describes a specific, internal reaction to professional challenges. Your simplification 'They saw Gabriela felt bad' is too general and loses this critical detail of personal interpretation. \n*   The original 'enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom' conveys a professional desire for autonomy. Your simplification 'They liked to have new ideas. They liked to do what they wanted' is too simplistic and loses the professional context of 'initiative' and 'creative freedom'. \n*   The original 'cultural differences' and 'not used to being told what to do' implies a deeper, systemic issue. Your version simplifies this to 'different ways of life' and 'This was new for them', which reduces the impact of the cultural context. \nSuggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific emotional and professional nuances. Use vocabulary that, while A2, more accurately reflects the original's meaning, such as 'felt it was about her' instead of 'felt bad' to convey 'taking it personally'. Ensure the professional context of 'initiative' and 'freedom' is not lost in simplification.",

The `Vocabulary Candidates for Replacement` list clearly identified these words as non-A2. You must adhere strictly to A2 vocabulary. Specific deviations include: The word 'leadership' is B1. It appears in the sentence 'She talked openly about her leadership.' This word must be replaced with simpler A2 terms, such as 'how she led' or 'her way of leading'. The word 'used' is B1. It appears in the sentence 'They said they were not used to being told what to do.' This must be rephrased using A2 vocabulary, for example, 'They said they did not like it when someone told them what to do'. The word 'openly' is B2. It appears in the sentence 'She talked openly about her leadership.' This must be simplified to 'She talked clearly' or 'She talked honestly'. The word 'being' is B2.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6508 is significantly below the required 0.75. This indicates a substantial loss of the original text's core message and nuance. Additionally, the BERTScore of 0.8995 is below the required 0.90, showing a lack of lexical fidelity.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score: The score of 0.6508 is too low. The output simplifies the complex interaction described in the original. For example, 'became aware of the cultural differences' and 'took the initiative to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership' is reduced to 'Gabriela saw different ways of working. Her team worked in a different way. She wanted to talk to them. She talked clearly about her way of leading.' This loses the specific 'cultural' aspect, the 'initiative,' the 'open conversation,' and the focus on 'their feelings' about 'her leadership.'\n- BERTScore: The score of 0.8995 is below the 0.90 threshold. Key terms and phrases from the original have been replaced with less specific or slightly altered vocabulary, contributing to the lower score. Examples include:\n  - 'cultural differences' replaced with 'different ways of working'.\n  - 'took the initiative to have an open conversation' replaced with 'wanted to talk to them. She talked clearly'.\n  - 'their feelings about her leadership' replaced with 'her way of leading'.\n  - 'not used to being told what to do' is slightly altered to 'did not like it when someone told them what to do', losing the nuance of a habitual norm.\n  - 'initiative and creative freedom' replaced with 'make their own plans. They liked to choose how to do their work', losing the specific term 'creative freedom'.\n  - 'challenge or make changes to her decisions' replaced with 'change her ideas', losing 'challenge' and 'decisions'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the text to ensure all key concepts, specific actions (like 'took the initiative'), and the emotional context (like 'feelings' and 'taking it personally') are preserved, even when simplified. Focus on maintaining the original's specific vocabulary where possible, or finding direct A2 equivalents that do not dilute the meaning. Ensure the output explicitly states the 'cultural differences' and the nature of the 'open conversation' about 'leadership'.",

The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms the use of appropriate A1/A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures. The text effectively breaks down complex ideas into short, direct sentences, using basic connectors like 'and' (implied) and 'when'. The simplification of 'not used to being told what to do' to 'did not know this way to work. This was their normal way of working' is an effective A2 rephrasing. The phrase 'Or when they tried to change her decisions' as a separate sentence is slightly clunky but maintains simplicity, which is acceptable for A2.",
