In Moscow about 35,000 dogs live on the streets. Some were born in the wild and some were pets that were abandoned by their owners. In 2010 scientists (people who study nature by observing and experimenting) studied the dogs. They discovered that the dogs have adapted successfully to city life. The dogs learned that it is safer to cross streets with people. Some dogs even seem to understand traffic lights.",

Factual integrity is maintained, and the key metrics for meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.77) and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.96) are well above the required thresholds. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The handling of keywords was excellent; the parenthetical definitions for 'wild dogs' and 'scientists' are clear, concise, and perfectly integrated for a B1 reader. For further improvement, consider two points. First, the original sentence 'Some dogs live alone and others live in packs' was omitted. While not a factual error, including this detail would provide a more complete picture. Second, the word 'abandoned' could be simplified to a more common B1 phrase like 'left behind by their owners' to increase accessibility.",
