    "feedback": "This is a strong B1 performance. The text successfully simplifies complex ideas into clear, connected sentences. For example, changing 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' to 'important science magazines' is an excellent B1-level paraphrase. The sentence structure is good, and the use of a relative clause in 'a smart home that she designed herself' is a clear demonstration of B1 competence. The vocabulary is appropriate for the level, and all key facts from the original text are accurately included. The writing is coherent and easy to understand.",
