The primary reason for this classification appears to be the complexity and length of the sentences, particularly the first and last sentences. For example, the sentence 'Using the technology they have now, NASA can follow these objects and predict if they might hit Earth, so if this happens, they could launch two ways to protect our planet' is 39 words long and combines multiple clauses with 'so if', which is more characteristic of B2 grammar. To achieve a B1 level, consider breaking down longer sentences into two or more shorter, simpler sentences. For instance, the last sentence could be split: 'NASA can use their technology to follow these objects. They can also predict if the objects might hit Earth. If this happens, NASA could launch two ways to protect our planet.' Also, ensure that the grammatical structures are consistently B1, avoiding complex conditional or participial clauses where simpler alternatives exist.",

This is likely due to the retention of the B2 vocabulary item 'Potentially' within the term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids', and the overall length and complexity of some sentences. For example, the sentence 'Space rocks called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' are rocks which pass less than 7.5 million kilometres from Earth's orbit' combines a technical term with a long relative clause and specific measurements, pushing it beyond B1. To achieve B1, consider simplifying or defining 'Potentially' (e.g., 'possibly dangerous') and breaking down longer sentences into shorter, more direct statements. For instance, 'NASA can use the technology they have now to follow these objects and predict if they might hit Earth' could be split into two sentences to improve readability for a B1 audience.",

While the writer successfully simplified sentence structures by splitting longer sentences and replaced many A2/B1 vocabulary candidates effectively (e.g., 'threat' to 'danger', 'track' to 'follow', 'defence solutions' to 'ways to protect our planet'), the retention of the term 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' likely contributed to the B2 classification. The word 'potentially' is explicitly listed as a B2 vocabulary candidate. Although the term was defined, its presence, especially as a key term, can elevate the overall complexity for a B1 learner. For future simplifications, consider if such technical terms can be replaced with a simpler, descriptive phrase, even if it means losing some specificity, or if the definition needs to be even more integrated and simplified to ensure the overall text remains firmly within the B1 band.",

The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. Qualitatively, the simplification is highly effective. The writer successfully transformed complex phrases such as 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids' into 'Asteroids that might hit Earth' and 'defence solutions' into 'ways to protect our planet', which are excellent B1-level equivalents. The original's final complex sentence was skillfully broken down into three simpler sentences ('NASA can use the technology they have now to follow these objects. They can also predict if they might hit Earth. If this happens, they could launch two ways to protect our planet.'), significantly improving readability and flow for a B1 audience. The use of connectors like 'but', 'also', and 'If this happens' is appropriate for the target level. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
