    "text_translated": "More questions are about how **genes** influence brain and language development. **Genes are the instructions inside our bodies that decide how we grow.** For example, did certain genes evolve and give us the ability to speak? Researchers have found a specific change in a gene. This change occurred between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. It seems to be connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Although monkeys have a similar gene, it did not develop in this way. It is too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that meets all requirements. The output successfully passes the Factual Integrity, Meaning Preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.82), and CEFR Compliance checks. The qualitative analysis is also outstanding. The keyword 'genes' was defined clearly and placed perfectly within the text for maximum context. Furthermore, complex concepts like 'gene mutation' were skillfully simplified to 'a specific change in a gene', making the text highly accessible for a B1 audience without losing critical information. The sentence structure was also improved for readability. This is a model B1 simplification.",
