While the simplification is excellent in terms of clarity, factual integrity, and meaning preservation (MeaningBERT score of 0.85 is strong), it has been over-simplified for the target audience. The linguistic evidence for the A2 classification includes the heavy replacement of original vocabulary with simpler A1/A2 alternatives (e.g., 'mutated' became 'change'). To meet the B1 requirement, the text needs slightly more complex vocabulary and sentence structures. Suggestion: Retain or replace some words with B1-level synonyms instead of A1/A2 ones to increase the lexical density appropriate for the target level. For example, 'undergo this mutation' could be simplified to 'develop in this way' rather than 'change in this way'. The handling of the keyword 'genes' with an in-text definition was executed perfectly."

The sentence 'Researchers have found a specific modification in a gene that occurred between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, which seems to be connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face' is too long and structurally complex for a B1 reader due to its multiple clauses. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences, such as: 'Researchers found a specific change in a gene from 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected with speaking.' Additionally, the word 'modification' (C1 level) was used to replace 'mutation', which makes the text more difficult, not simpler. A better B1 alternative would be 'change'. While the text successfully preserved the original meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.8366) and defined the keyword 'genes', the failure to meet the target CEFR level is critical."
