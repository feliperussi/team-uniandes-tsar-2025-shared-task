    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets all A2 requirements. Factual Integrity: All facts, names, and numbers from the original text are correctly preserved. Metric Compliance: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8265 and BERTScore of 0.9131 are well within the required thresholds, indicating successful meaning preservation and lexical fidelity. CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2. Structural Analysis: The use of short, simple sentences is exemplary for the A2 level. The decision to split the final fact about North America into a separate sentence is a correct simplification strategy. Vocabulary: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A2 level. Words like 'successful' and 'major' are used appropriately. Minor Point for Improvement: The phrase 'young-people book' is grammatically awkward. Suggestion: Use 'book for young people' for better fluency while remaining within A2 constraints.",
