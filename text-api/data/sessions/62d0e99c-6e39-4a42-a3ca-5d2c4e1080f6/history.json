'Worldwide' must be replaced with an A2 phrase like 'around the world'.\n\n- Omission: The original text introduces the book as 'hugely successful'.

The text is a list of short, disconnected sentences. This structure is too simple for the A2 level. A2 writing should connect ideas using simple conjunctions like 'and' or 'so'. The sentences 'It is about a competition. Young people fight to stay alive in the competition.' add information not present in the source text, further reducing fidelity. Suggestion: Retain more of the original key terms like 'successful book' and 'major film'. Combine short sentences to create more natural A2-level structures.

The sentence 'It was the first book for young people' is factually incorrect. The original text specifies the book was the 'first book for young readers to sell more than a million electronic copies', not the first book ever for that audience. This is a complete failure of factual integrity.\n\n- Factual Error: The statement 'It was the first book for young people' is a gross misinterpretation. It changes the specific achievement (first to sell a million e-copies) into a false historical claim.\n- Structural Degradation: The original text's sentences have been broken down into excessively short, disconnected statements. This results in a choppy, unnatural rhythm that is below A2 standard. The text reads like a list of facts, not a coherent paragraph.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error immediately. The sentence must be rephrased to state: 'It was the first book for young people to sell over a million electronic copies.' Combine related short sentences to create better flow. For example: 'The film earned 152.5 million dollars in its first weekend in North America.'",
