    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all checks with high scores. The output successfully maintains factual integrity and core meaning, reflected in the high BERTScore (0.96) and MeaningBERT (0.89) scores. The key success in this text is the structural simplification: splitting the complex final sentence ('Engineers have learned to design...') into two clear, sequential sentences is a model technique for achieving B1 readability. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'relatively infrequent' with 'not very common', are also highly effective. The final text is clear, accurate, and well-suited for a B1 audience.",
