        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as B2, which is too complex for the target B1 level. The primary reason for this is the sentence structure. The first sentence, 'Although earthquakes damage all structures including bridges, this kind of collapse is not very common...', uses a subordinating conjunction ('Although') to create a long, complex sentence. This structure is characteristic of a B2 level. To correct this, the sentence should be simplified. Suggestion: Rephrase using two separate sentences or a simpler connector, such as: 'Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges. However, this kind of collapse is not very common...'. On a positive note, the text passed the factual integrity and meaning preservation checks with high scores, and the vocabulary simplifications were effective."

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks, with high scores for both MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.97). However, it fails because the CEFR classifier rated the output as 'B2', which is too complex for the 'B1' target. This is likely due to two factors: the retention of the B2-level vocabulary word 'collapse' and the use of a complex sentence structure in the final sentence: 'Engineers have learned how to design bridges in earthquake zones on ground that is more resistant to movement.' The relative clause 'that is more resistant to movement' increases the complexity. To meet the B1 target, consider replacing 'collapse' with a simpler phrase like 'this kind of damage'. Additionally, the final sentence could be simplified by splitting it, for example: 'Engineers have learned how to design bridges in earthquake zones. They build them on ground that is more resistant to movement.'"

The output successfully maintains factual integrity and core meaning, reflected in the high BERTScore (0.96) and MeaningBERT (0.89) scores. The key success in this text is the structural simplification: splitting the complex final sentence ('Engineers have learned to design...') into two clear, sequential sentences is a model technique for achieving B1 readability. Vocabulary choices, such as replacing 'relatively infrequent' with 'not very common', are also highly effective. The final text is clear, accurate, and well-suited for a B1 audience."
