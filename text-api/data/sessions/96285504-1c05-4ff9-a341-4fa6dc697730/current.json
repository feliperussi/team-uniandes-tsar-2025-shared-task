    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8832 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Meaning Error: The original text states people are 'waiting eagerly'. Your version, 'Many people are very happy for her next book', is a factual and semantic error. Eager anticipation is not the same as happiness. This inaccuracy is the primary cause of the low fidelity score.\n- Lexical Loss: Key terms were oversimplified, contributing to the score drop. 'New Yorker' was replaced with 'She lives in New York'. While factually correct, it loses the specific noun and lexical precision.\n- Structural Weakness: The text is a list of disconnected simple sentences. This is below A2 standard, which expects the use of basic connectors. The complete absence of connectors like 'and' or 'but' makes the text choppy and unnatural.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning of 'waiting eagerly'. Combine some of the short sentences using 'and' to create better-structured A2-level text. Re-evaluate simplifications to ensure they do not cause a critical loss of fidelity.",
