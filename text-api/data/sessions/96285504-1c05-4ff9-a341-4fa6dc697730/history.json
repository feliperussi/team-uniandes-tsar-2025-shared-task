This is an immediate and non-negotiable failure.\n\n- Factual Deviation: The first sentence must identify the book. The original states 'Wonder is...'. Your output 'The book is...' is factually incomplete.\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8917 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This metric confirms that critical lexical information, specifically the book's title, was lost during simplification.\n- Meaning Dilution: The phrase 'facial deformities' was simplified to 'face problem'. This simplification is too vague and loses the specific meaning and impact of the original concept.\n\nSuggestion: The title of the subject must always be retained. Re-insert the name 'Wonder' into the first sentence. The phrase 'face problem' must be revised to better capture the original meaning, for example: 'a girl whose face was very different'.",

This indicates an unacceptable loss of specific words and factual phrasing from the original text. While the simplification effort is noted, it has sacrificed too much lexical detail.\n\n- Deviation: The original phrase 'seeing a girl with facial deformities on the street one day' was reduced to 'saw a girl with different face'. This simplification removed the key contextual detail 'on the street one day'.\n- Deviation: The original concept 'a starting point for discussions' was simplified to 'use it to talk about'. This loses the specific meaning of the book initiating the conversation.\n- Deviation: The original phrase 'waiting eagerly' was reduced to 'want to see'. This simplification loses the emotional intensity conveyed by 'eagerly'.\n- Deviation: The structure is excessively fragmented. The repetition of 'They also use it to talk about...' in three consecutive sentences is stylistically poor and demonstrates an inability to use basic A2 connectors like 'and'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost factual details using simple language. Combine the list of topics using 'and' to create a more natural sentence structure. Example: 'Schools use it to talk about bullying, friendship, and being different.'",

The text passed all automated checks but fails on manual inspection due to vocabulary and sentence structures that exceed the A2 standard.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The phrase \"facial deformities\" is unsimplified and is significantly above the A2 level. This is a critical failure. It requires specialized vocabulary that an A2 reader would not possess.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The adverb \"eagerly\" is B1 level. It must be replaced with a simpler A2 construction.\n- Structural Violation: The sentence \"Many people wait eagerly to see what she writes next\" uses a 'what-clause' as an object of the verb 'see'. This is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- Grammatical Error: The sentence \"She said idea came...\" is missing the required article 'the' before 'idea'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase \"a girl with facial deformities\" to \"a girl whose face looked very different\". Replace \"wait eagerly to see what she writes next\" with a simpler construction like \"are very excited for her next book\". Correct the grammatical error by adding 'the'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Meaning Error: The original text states people are 'waiting eagerly'. Your version, 'Many people are very happy for her next book', is a factual and semantic error. Eager anticipation is not the same as happiness. This inaccuracy is the primary cause of the low fidelity score.\n- Lexical Loss: Key terms were oversimplified, contributing to the score drop. 'New Yorker' was replaced with 'She lives in New York'. While factually correct, it loses the specific noun and lexical precision.\n- Structural Weakness: The text is a list of disconnected simple sentences. This is below A2 standard, which expects the use of basic connectors. The complete absence of connectors like 'and' or 'but' makes the text choppy and unnatural.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the original meaning of 'waiting eagerly'. Combine some of the short sentences using 'and' to create better-structured A2-level text. Re-evaluate simplifications to ensure they do not cause a critical loss of fidelity.",
