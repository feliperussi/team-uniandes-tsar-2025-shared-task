As part of this, we should look for ways to offer working hours that can change to suit employees. We should also consider how we can allow employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff, and they should also provide more positive feedback and praise for the work that they do. Spending more money on professional training can also help create a positive environment for employees. This training should especially focus on social and communication skills to help them do their best work.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.94) metrics confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are excellent. For example, the complex final sentence of the original was effectively split into two clearer sentences, improving readability. Vocabulary choices are strong, such as replacing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with the more accessible 'positive feedback and praise'. The simplification of 'intercultural communication' to 'communication skills' is an appropriate and effective choice for the B1 level. Overall, this is a well-executed text.",
