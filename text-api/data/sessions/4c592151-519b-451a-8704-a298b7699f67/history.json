        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to two main issues. First, the output kept B2-level vocabulary from the original text, specifically 'flexible' and 'recognition'. Second, the sentence structures remain too complex. For example, the final sentence, 'Spending more money on professional training could also help to create a positive environment where employees can do their best work, especially in the area of social and communication skills,' is too long for a B1 reader. Suggestion: Replace B2 vocabulary with simpler alternatives (e.g., 'flexible working hours' could become 'working hours that can change to suit employees'). Break down long sentences into shorter ones (e.g., 'Spending more money on training can create a better workplace. This training should focus on social and communication skills.').",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.94) metrics confirm that the core message and key details have been preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategies are excellent. For example, the complex final sentence of the original was effectively split into two clearer sentences, improving readability. Vocabulary choices are strong, such as replacing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with the more accessible 'positive feedback and praise'. The simplification of 'intercultural communication' to 'communication skills' is an appropriate and effective choice for the B1 level. Overall, this is a well-executed text.",
