This indicates a failure to preserve the core message and narrative flow of the original text.\n\n- The primary failure is the loss of cause-and-effect. The original text connects Pi's actions to his feelings and realizations: he is terrified, so he jumps; he remembers the sharks, so he realizes he must climb back. Your version presents these as a list of separate facts ('Pi is very scared. So he jumps.'), which weakens the meaning of desperation.\n- The original phrase 'realises his only option is to climb back' describes a moment of sudden understanding. Your version, 'He knows he must go back to the lifeboat. It is his only choice,' is a simple statement of fact and loses the critical meaning of realization.\n- The original uses 'till only Pi and the tiger are left' to describe a process of elimination. Your use of 'Soon' changes this meaning to a simple statement about time.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore the cause-and-effect relationships. Use simple connectors like 'so' and 'because' to link actions to reasons directly. For example: 'Pi is scared of the animals, so he jumps into the ocean. But he must go back because there are sharks in the water.' This structure preserves the original meaning more accurately.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the MeaningBERT score of 0.6881, which is substantially below the required threshold of 0.75. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Score Violation: Your score of 0.6881 is unacceptable. The original text conveys a strong sense of terror, sudden realization, and desperation. Your version weakens this into a simple sequence of events.\n- Tonal Inaccuracy: The original uses words like 'terrified' and 'realises his only option' to create a tone of immediate danger. Your replacement phrases 'very scared' and 'understands he must go back' are too neutral and fail to capture this intensity.\n- Dilution of Content: The addition of definitions for 'lifeboat' and 'seasick', while simple, dilutes the narrative and contributes to the low meaning similarity score. The focus shifted from the character's experience to explaining vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to restore the original's tone. Use stronger A2-level vocabulary to convey fear. Rephrase to emphasize that returning to the boat was not just an idea, but a desperate, forced action. The core narrative must be the absolute priority over added definitions.",
