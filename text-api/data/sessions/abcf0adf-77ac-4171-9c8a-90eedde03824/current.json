    "feedback": "The output meets all requirements of the A2 standard. Factual integrity is maintained. All metrics are above the required thresholds: MeaningBERT at 0.816 and BERTScore at 0.9269 confirm that meaning and key terms were preserved. The CEFR classifier result of A2 is accurate. A qualitative audit confirms strict adherence to A2 constraints. Vocabulary is appropriately simplified, replacing words like 'terrified' and 'fortunately' with 'scared' and 'lucky'. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only basic A2-level connectors. The definition provided for the keyword 'lifeboat' is a model of A2 clarity. No deviations were found.",
