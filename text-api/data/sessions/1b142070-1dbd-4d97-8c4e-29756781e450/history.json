The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because specific phrases like 'psychologist and proponent' and 'continued honing of talents' were replaced with overly simple terms like 'expert' and 'talents improve', losing required lexical detail.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (Classifier): The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an automatic failure. The analysis below details the reasons.\n- Unapproved B1/B2 Vocabulary: The text uses words above the A2 level. 'growth' (B1), 'effort' (B1), 'means' (B2), and 'testing' (B2) are not permitted.\n- B1 Sentence Structure: The text uses grammatical structures that are too complex for A2. The sentence 'Carol Dweck is an expert who studies thinking' uses a relative clause ('who studies...'), which is a B1 structure. The sentence 'A growth mindset means believing you can get better by trying' uses a gerund phrase after 'means', which is also a B1 structure.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary. 'Effort' must be replaced with 'hard work'. 'Testing' must be replaced with 'trying new ways'. 'Means' must be rephrased to 'is when...'.\n- Suggestion: Simplify all complex sentences. 'Carol Dweck is an expert who studies thinking' must be split into two A2 sentences: 'Carol Dweck is an expert. She studies thinking.'\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'A growth mindset means believing...' to 'A growth mindset is when you believe...'",

The simplification has removed too much lexical detail, failing the primary objective of fidelity.\n\nFurther analysis reveals additional failures:\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure. The B1 classification is caused by vocabulary and sentence structure that are too advanced for the A2 level.\n\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses words from higher CEFR levels. The word 'psychologist' is B2. The word 'planning' is B1. These words are not on a standard A2 list and must be replaced or simplified.\n\n- Sentence Structure Exceeds A2 Level: The sentence 'When we praise how someone works, we help them grow' is a B1 structure. It begins with a subordinate clause ('When we praise...') and contains an embedded clause ('how someone works'). This is too complex for an A2 reader.\n\n- Definition Structure: The definitions 'Plasticity is when...' and 'A growth mindset is when...' use a structure that is borderline B1. A2 requires more direct phrasing.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Replace 'psychologist' with 'a person who studies how people think'. Replace 'planning events' with 'making plans for events'. The complex sentence 'When we praise how someone works, we help them grow' must be split into two simple sentences. Example: 'We can praise how a person works. This helps them grow.' Rephrase definitions to use 'This means...' instead of 'is when...'.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7051 is below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8532 is below the required 0.90.

This damages the fidelity to the source text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2.

The word 'growth' is also B1, and while part of a key term, its definition used the forbidden B2 word 'means'.\n\n- Structural Violation: The B1 classification was triggered by grammatical structures too complex for A2. The sentence 'It says praising hard work works better' uses a gerund ('praising') as the subject of a clause. The phrase 'the way a person works' is also a B1-level structure.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the specific concepts of 'experimentation' and 'problem-solving'. Replace the word 'means' with an A2-level phrase like 'This is when...'. Replace 'planning' with 'organising'. Break down complex sentences.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7091 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8546 is below the required 0.90. The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of the core message and lexical fidelity. The original text's central idea is a contrast between two types of praise; your version loses this contrast and merely lists facts.\n\nFurther violations detected:\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'psychologist' is B2 level. The word 'growth' is B1 level. These are unacceptable for an A2 text. They must be replaced or defined in A2 terms within the text.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence \"Research says that praising hard work works better\" uses a 'that-clause', a B1 grammatical structure. This is too complex for A2.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentence \"Praising hard work, trying new ways and solving problems helps new skills grow\" uses a list of gerunds as a complex subject. This is a B1 structure and must be simplified.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the entire text to restore the core contrast between praising results and praising effort. Remove the word 'psychologist' and replace it with an A2 description like \"a person who studies how people think.\" Break down all complex sentences. Remove the 'that-clause'. Rewrite the final sentence into several simple A2 sentences.",

The BERTScore of 0.854 is also below the 0.90 minimum. The text's core message, which contrasts two approaches to praise, was lost due to excessive simplification and robotic repetition. The output is a list of disconnected facts, not a coherent A2 summary.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an instant failure.\n- Structural Violation: The first sentence, 'A person who studies how people think is Carol Dweck,' uses a defining relative clause ('who studies...'). This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not permitted at the A2 level.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B2 word 'means' is used twice. This is unacceptable. The B1 word 'growth' is used in the key phrase 'growth mindset'. While the phrase was defined, the word itself is above A2 level.\n- Stylistic Failure: The extreme repetition of phrases like 'Research says...' and 'Praising... helps new skills grow' is unnatural and degrades readability. It fragments the central idea that praising the process (effort, experimentation, problem-solving) is what helps skills develop.\n\nSuggestion: Remove the B1 relative clause. Rephrase the first sentence into two simple A2 sentences. Example: 'Carol Dweck is a person. She studies how people think.' Replace the B2 word 'means' with an A2 structure. Example: 'Brain plasticity is the idea that the brain can change.' Combine the repetitive sentences to convey the core concept. Example: 'Research says it is better to praise hard work, trying new things, and how a person solves problems.'",

The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1, not A2.\n\nDiagnostic Analysis:\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because key phrases were oversimplified, losing essential meaning. For example, 'problem-solving strategies' was reduced to the grammatically incorrect 'how problems', which does not carry the same meaning.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The text was classified as B1. This is a direct result of using grammatical structures and vocabulary that are too advanced for the A2 level.\n- B1+ Vocabulary Violation: The text uses multiple words above the A2 level. 'psychologist' is a B2 word. 'growth' and 'effort' are B1 words. These are unacceptable deviations.\n- B1 Grammatical Structure Violation: The text repeatedly uses 'that-clauses' and 'how-clauses', which are B1 structures. Examples include: 'the idea that the brain can change', 'shows that praising effort', and 'studies how people think'. These complex sentences are the primary reason for the B1 classification.\n- Awkward Phrasing: The final sentence, 'Research also shows that praising how problems helps skills grow,' is grammatically incorrect and unclear.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Replace 'psychologist' with 'a person who studies how people think'. Replace 'effort' with 'trying hard'.\n- Suggestion: Remove all 'that-clauses' and 'how-clauses'. Rewrite these sentences as two separate, simple sentences. For example, instead of 'Brain plasticity is the idea that the brain can change,' write 'She talks about brain plasticity. This means the brain can change.'\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the final sentences to accurately reflect 'problem-solving strategies' using only A2 words. For example: 'It is good to praise people when they try to find answers to problems.'",
