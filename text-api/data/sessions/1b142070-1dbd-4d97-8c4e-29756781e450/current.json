    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8587 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, compromising its fidelity.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The low BERTScore is a direct result of oversimplification. Key concepts like 'problem-solving strategies' and 'continued honing of talents' were completely removed, not simplified. This is an unacceptable loss of information.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B2): The word 'psychologist' is B2 level. It was used without simplification. It must be replaced with an A2 description, such as 'a person who studies how people think'.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B1): The word 'effort' is B1 level. It was used without simplification or definition. It must be replaced with an A2 phrase like 'trying hard'.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B2): The word 'means' is B2 level. It was used twice for definitions. This structure is too advanced. Rephrase definitions directly. Example: 'Plasticity is when the brain can change.'\n- Structural Flaw: The repetition in the final three sentences ('Research also shows that...') is unnatural and poor writing. These points must be combined into a single, clear sentence using 'and'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts that were deleted to meet the BERTScore requirement. Replace all vocabulary above the A2 level. Combine the repetitive final sentences into one.",
