While the general narrative of the events is maintained, the simplification loses some of the original text's nuanced meaning and intensity. For example, the phrase 'unnecessarily cruel' was simplified to 'not kind'. The original phrase conveys a stronger moral judgment and implies that the cruelty could have been avoided, whereas 'not kind' is a much milder and less specific statement. This reduction in semantic depth likely contributed to the lower score. Similarly, 'heated arguments' became 'strong arguments', losing some of the emotional intensity present in the original. The core message about the specific nature of the cruelty that prompted the protests is somewhat diluted in the simplified version. To improve, ensure that the emotional and judgmental nuances of the original text are preserved, even when simplifying vocabulary.",

While the text maintains factual accuracy, there is a subtle but significant shift in the core message's emphasis. For example, the original text states 'shooting pigs was unnecessarily cruel', highlighting the suffering aspect. The simplified text changes this to 'killing pigs with guns was wrong and not necessary'. While 'not necessary' is similar, 'wrong' is a broader moral judgment that does not fully capture the specific nuance of 'cruel'. Similarly, 'peaceful action' in the original implies non-violence, which is slightly diluted by 'calmer way' in the simplification. These changes, though seemingly minor, alter the emotional and ethical emphasis of the original, leading to a lower meaning preservation score. To improve, ensure that the emotional and ethical connotations of key terms are maintained or carefully rephrased to convey the same depth of meaning.",

The primary reason for this classification is the retention of complex sentence structures and some vocabulary that exceeds the B1 threshold. For example, the sentence 'Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past' is too long and contains multiple clauses and the idiom 'losing battle', making it B2. To achieve a B1 level, this sentence should be split into shorter, simpler sentences. For instance, 'We do not know if this plan will work. It might be a difficult fight because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.' Additionally, while 'unnecessarily cruel' was simplified to 'too cruel and not necessary', other B2 vocabulary like 'shooting' and 'council' were retained. Consider replacing 'shooting' with 'killing' or 'hunting' and 'council' with 'local government' or 'city leaders' if appropriate for the context.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.8624 and BERTScore of 0.9681 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. Qualitatively, the simplification strategies employed are highly effective. Complex phrases like 'unnecessarily cruel' were skillfully rephrased as 'too cruel and not necessary'. The term 'city council' was appropriately simplified to 'city leaders', and 'shooting pigs' to 'killing pigs'. The original's final complex sentence, 'Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past,' was expertly split into two simpler B1-level sentences: 'We do not know if this plan will work. It might be a difficult fight because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.' This demonstrates a strong understanding of B1 sentence structuring and vocabulary replacement ('strategy' to 'plan', 'losing battle' to 'difficult fight'). The use of connectors like 'So' and 'because' is also appropriate for B1. This is a very strong simplification.",
