In response to these protests, the city leaders decided to take more peaceful action against the pigs. So, instead of killing them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. We do not know if this plan will work. It might be a difficult fight because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors; the output accurately reflects all information from the original text. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8624 and BERTScore of 0.9681 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. Furthermore, the CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. Qualitatively, the simplification strategies employed are highly effective. Complex phrases like 'unnecessarily cruel' were skillfully rephrased as 'too cruel and not necessary'. The term 'city council' was appropriately simplified to 'city leaders', and 'shooting pigs' to 'killing pigs'. The original's final complex sentence, 'Time will tell if this strategy works, though it may be a losing battle as warmer winters mean that pig numbers are greater than in the past,' was expertly split into two simpler B1-level sentences: 'We do not know if this plan will work. It might be a difficult fight because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before.' This demonstrates a strong understanding of B1 sentence structuring and vocabulary replacement ('strategy' to 'plan', 'losing battle' to 'difficult fight'). The use of connectors like 'So' and 'because' is also appropriate for B1. This is a very strong simplification.",
