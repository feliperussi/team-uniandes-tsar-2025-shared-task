This loses the specific academic or survey-topic nature of the original phrasing. - The original text mentions 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'.

This completely removes the concepts of 'perceptions', 'threats', 'opportunities', and 'complex', which are central to the original meaning. - The original text uses 'conducted by' and 'participated in a study about'.

MeaningBERT and BERTScore are absolute priority metrics for content preservation. Failure here is an instant and critical failure. MeaningBERT score of 0.5166 is unacceptable. The original text specifies 'workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work\u2013life balance' and 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'. Your version reduces these to vague phrases such as 'many things about work' and 'problems they see at work / good chances they see at work'. This is a failure to preserve the core meaning. BERTScore of 0.8652 is below the required 0.90. This indicates an unacceptable loss of key terms and factual phrasing. Specific examples include the replacement of 'workplace culture' with 'how people work together', 'communication and working styles' with 'how people talk at work' and 'how people work', 'pay structure' with 'money for work', 'career development' with 'getting better jobs', 'work\u2013life balance' with 'time for work and time for life', and 'complex world of work' with 'The world of work has many parts'. These are not lexically faithful to the original. Corrective Action: The text must be rewritten to retain the specific topics and concepts from the original. Do not sacrifice specific meaning for simplicity. Ensure key terms are either retained or replaced with A2 equivalents that accurately convey the original concept, not just a general idea. For example, 'workplace culture' should be simplified to 'how people work in a company' or similar, not just 'how people work together'. The concepts of 'threats' and 'opportunities' must be conveyed more precisely.",

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The BERTScore of 0.8645 is also below the required 0.90, indicating a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original.  Meaning Preservation: The original text clearly states that surveys were conducted on specific topics such as 'workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work\u2013life balance' and 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'. Your output fragments these into many disconnected, overly simplistic sentences ('It looked at how people work in a company. It looked at how people talk at work.'). This loses the overarching concept of the survey's focus areas and the nuanced meaning of 'perceptions' and 'complex world'.  Fidelity Loss: The extensive simplification replaced specific original terms with less precise, basic descriptions. For example, 'workplace culture' became 'how people work in a company', 'communication' became 'how people talk at work', and 'threats and opportunities' became 'bad things that can happen at work' and 'good chances for them at work'. While these are simple, they do not retain enough lexical fidelity to the original, resulting in the low BERTScore.  Suggestion: Rephrase the text to maintain the connection between the surveys and the specific topics they investigated. Do not fragment complex concepts into excessively simple, disconnected sentences. Ensure that the simplified vocabulary, while A2, still conveys the essence and purpose of the original terms. For example, instead of listing 'It looked at how people work...', combine these ideas to state 'The survey asked about different parts of work, like how people work together, how they talk, and how they get paid.' This preserves more of the original meaning and lexical content.",

Similarly, 'threats and opportunities in the complex world of work' from the Deloitte survey became 'good and bad things in this world'. This level of simplification removes too much of the original content's substance. Suggestion: Rephrase the text to retain more specific details about the survey topics and findings, using A2 vocabulary. Do not sacrifice core information for simplicity. For instance, instead of 'many parts of work', list a few more specific, A2-friendly examples of the original topics.

The MeaningBERT score of 0.5465 is significantly below the required 0.75, indicating a substantial loss of the original message's intent and nuance. The BERTScore of 0.8721 is below the required 0.90, demonstrating a failure to retain key words and factual phrasing. The output oversimplifies the specific topics of the surveys. For example, the original text specifies 'workplace culture, communication and working styles, pay structure, career development, work\u2013life balance' and 'perceptions of the threats and opportunities in the complex world of work'. Your version reduces these to generic phrases such as 'asked about work', 'how people feel at work', 'how they talk and their ways of working', 'how they get their money', 'getting better jobs', 'time for work and life', and 'bad things and good things that can happen in this world'. This simplification removes critical information and the specific focus of the surveys. Suggestion: Retain more specific details from the original text. Do not oversimplify the topics of the surveys. Use A2 vocabulary to describe the specific topics, rather than generic phrases. For instance, instead of 'It asked about how people feel at work', attempt to convey 'workplace culture' using A2 terms. Instead of 'bad things and good things', convey 'threats and opportunities' with appropriate A2 vocabulary.",
