While the submission passes the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with excellent scores (MeaningBERT 0.90, BERTScore 0.97), the simplification was too aggressive. The resulting text lacks the lexical complexity expected at the B1 level. This is evidenced by the replacement of words like 'affectionate' with the A1-level 'friendly' and simplifying 'lost count of the times' to 'often'. To meet the B1 requirement, the text needs to incorporate a slightly more advanced vocabulary without sacrificing the clear sentence structure. Suggestion: Reintroduce one or two B1-level words to elevate the text to the target level while ensuring it remains comprehensible.",

The MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.98) are both very high, indicating superb preservation of the original message and phrasing. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The structural adjustments are particularly effective for the B1 level; for example, replacing 'But' with the more formal connector 'However' and adding 'because' to clarify the causal relationship ('...react badly, because she did not like rats either...') improves the logical flow for the reader. The vocabulary was handled appropriately, retaining A2-level words that are suitable for a B1 audience. The final output is clear, accurate, and well-structured.",
