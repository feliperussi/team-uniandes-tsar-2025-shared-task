She has lost count of the times she has tried to explain to people that rats are not dirty and that they make fantastic pets if you look after them correctly. However, she understands why people react badly, because she did not like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his own pets and she saw how affectionate and intelligent they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted to have two of them.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that successfully passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.98) are both very high, indicating superb preservation of the original message and phrasing. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The structural adjustments are particularly effective for the B1 level; for example, replacing 'But' with the more formal connector 'However' and adding 'because' to clarify the causal relationship ('...react badly, because she did not like rats either...') improves the logical flow for the reader. The vocabulary was handled appropriately, retaining A2-level words that are suitable for a B1 audience. The final output is clear, accurate, and well-structured.",
