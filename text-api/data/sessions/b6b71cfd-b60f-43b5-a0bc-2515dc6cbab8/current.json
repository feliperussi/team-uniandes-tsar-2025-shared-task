    "feedback": "PASS: The text meets all A2 requirements. Factual integrity is maintained, meaning preservation metrics are high (MeaningBERT: 0.822, BERTScore: 0.9145), and the CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n\nDiagnostic Audit:\n- Vocabulary Control: Excellent. The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A1 and A2 levels. No words exceed the A2 standard.\n- Structural Simplicity: The text correctly uses short, simple sentences. The simplification of complex ideas from the original text is effective.\n- Keyword Definition: The definition provided for 'street art' is clear, simple, and uses A2-level vocabulary.\n- Point of Improvement: The final sentence, \"For her, this shows that life changes, ending and starting again,\" uses a 'that-clause' which is a B1-level structure. While the text passes overall, a stricter A2 construction would be to split this into two sentences. Suggestion: Rephrase to \"For her, this shows how life changes. It is always ending and starting again.\"",
