    "text_translated": "Sometimes bridges fall down and people do not know why. People who build bridges study the problem to understand the reason. Sometimes, this happens because they built the bridge with bad material. Or it happens because there was a problem with an important part of the bridge. In other cases, they built the bridge to hold a specific weight. It could not hold more weight than that.",

    "feedback": "This is a flawless A2 text. The writer successfully avoided the passive voice present in the original text ('was used', 'was designed') by rephrasing with an active subject ('they built'). Complex concepts like 'engineers' and 'inferior-quality material' were perfectly simplified into A2-level explanations ('People who build bridges', 'bad material'). The sentence structure is simple, declarative, and immediately understandable. No violations of the A2 standard were found.",
