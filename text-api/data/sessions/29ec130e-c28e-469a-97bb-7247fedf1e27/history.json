While the simplification of complex terms like 'investigation', 'defect', and 'inferior-quality' is commendable, a single violation of the core vocabulary rule results in an automatic failure. Adherence must be absolute."

The writer successfully avoided the passive voice present in the original text ('was used', 'was designed') by rephrasing with an active subject ('they built').

The sentence structure is simple, declarative, and immediately understandable. No violations of the A2 standard were found."
