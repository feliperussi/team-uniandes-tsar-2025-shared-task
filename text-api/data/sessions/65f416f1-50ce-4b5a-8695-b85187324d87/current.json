    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. There are no factual errors, and both MeaningBERT (0.9453) and BERTScore (0.9917) are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity level. The writer made very subtle changes, such as rephrasing 'the Canadian author Yann Martel' to 'Yann Martel, who is a Canadian author,' and adding 'he' to clarify the subject in the final sentence. These changes are minor but do not detract from the text's clarity or B1 suitability. For future tasks, while the current output is compliant, consider if there are more opportunities to simplify vocabulary or sentence structures when the original text is already quite accessible. For instance, the word 'diplomat' (C1) was retained; while understandable in context, it could have been a candidate for a simpler explanation or definition if a more significant simplification effort was desired.",
