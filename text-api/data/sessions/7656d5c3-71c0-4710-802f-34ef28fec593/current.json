    "feedback": "Overall assessment: PASS. This is an excellent simplification that successfully meets all core requirements.\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually correct and preserves all key information from the original text.\nMeaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.96) confirm that the core message and key details have been maintained effectively.\nCEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level.\nQualitative Analysis: The simplification is very well executed. The vocabulary choices are strong, for example, using 'decorate' and 'painted an entire' to make the text more accessible. The sentence structure is clear and improves the flow of information, such as the added explanation for why cranes are needed. The descriptive addition 'turning its stone into a bright artwork' enhances the text for the reader without introducing errors. A minor point is the removal of the word 'identical' when describing the twins; while this is a valid simplification, it does remove a small piece of specific information.",
