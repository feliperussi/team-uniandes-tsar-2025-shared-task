This is likely because key descriptive details were omitted during simplification. The original text states the artists are 'identical twin brothers' and that they paint 'pictures of people'. Your output removes both 'identical' and 'of people', which alters the core description of the artists and their work. Additionally, the text fails on CEFR Compliance. The classifier result is 'A2', which is below the target 'B1'. This suggests the vocabulary and sentence structures are too simple. To correct this, reintroduce the key omitted facts to restore meaning and consider using slightly more complex B1-level vocabulary to meet the required CEFR level.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' target level. This failure is primarily due to overly complex sentence structures. For example, the first sentence 'Os G\u00eameos are identical twin brothers from S\u00e3o Paulo who decorate walls, creating everything...' uses both a relative clause ('who decorate...') and a participle clause ('creating everything...'), a construction more typical of the B2 level. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences, such as 'Os G\u00eameos are identical twin brothers from S\u00e3o Paulo. They decorate walls and create everything...'. The final sentence also uses a participle clause ('...turning its stone into a bright artwork'), which increases its complexity. Suggestion: Rephrase this as a separate sentence: 'They turned its stone into a bright artwork.' Finally, the B2-level vocabulary word 'identical' was retained from the original, which also contributed to the higher CEFR rating.",

The original text states they 'covered the whole of a castle in Scotland', but the output incorrectly states they painted 'the entire surface of a lot of a castle in Scotland'. Changing 'the whole' to 'a lot of' alters the scale of the achievement described. Additionally, the phrase 'a lot of a castle' is grammatically awkward. A more accurate simplification would be: 'In 2007, they painted an entire castle in Scotland.' Despite this critical error, the simplification did successfully maintain the target B1 level and passed the automated meaning and fidelity checks.",

This is an excellent simplification that successfully meets all core requirements.\nFactual Integrity: The output is factually correct and preserves all key information from the original text.\nMeaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.84) and BERTScore (0.96) confirm that the core message and key details have been maintained effectively.\nCEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level.\nQualitative Analysis: The simplification is very well executed. The vocabulary choices are strong, for example, using 'decorate' and 'painted an entire' to make the text more accessible. The sentence structure is clear and improves the flow of information, such as the added explanation for why cranes are needed. The descriptive addition 'turning its stone into a bright artwork' enhances the text for the reader without introducing errors. A minor point is the removal of the word 'identical' when describing the twins; while this is a valid simplification, it does remove a small piece of specific information.",
