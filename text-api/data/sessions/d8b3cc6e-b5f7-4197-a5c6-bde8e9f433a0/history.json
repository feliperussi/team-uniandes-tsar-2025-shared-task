While the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.9383, BERTScore: 0.9643), the sentence structure and information density are too complex for a B1 reader. For example, the sentence 'Plans are to test DART on the moon of an asteroid (a small rocky object that orbits the Sun) called Didymos' combines a parenthetical definition with a relative clause, making it quite long and dense. Similarly, the final sentence, 'Hopefully, the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit enough for telescopes on Earth to pick up the change', while grammatically sound for B1, packs a lot of information into a single clause. To achieve a B1 level, consider breaking down longer sentences into two or more shorter, more direct sentences. For instance, the last sentence could be split into: 'Hopefully, the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit. This will be enough for telescopes on Earth to pick up the change.'

While the writer made good efforts to simplify sentence structures and define 'DART' ('which stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test'), the overall text complexity was not sufficiently reduced to meet the B1 target. This is likely due to two main factors. Firstly, the addition of a full sentence definition for 'asteroid' ('An asteroid is a small rocky object that orbits the Sun.') increased the overall information load and length of the text. While defining keywords is crucial, adding new, unprompted information can sometimes elevate the perceived complexity, especially when the original text is already concise. Secondly, the text retains a high density of specific scientific proper nouns (e.g., 'Double Asteroid Redirection Test', 'Didymos', 'Didymoon') and precise numerical details ('150 metres wide', '800-metre mother'). Although these are proper nouns and facts, their concentration can contribute to a B2 classification by the CEFR model. To improve, consider if the definition of 'asteroid' could be integrated more concisely or if the overall information density can be further reduced without losing core meaning. Ensure that any added information strictly serves the B1 simplification goal without inadvertently increasing overall complexity.",

While the text successfully maintained factual integrity and meaning, as indicated by the high MeaningBERT (0.9452) and BERTScore (0.9706), its linguistic complexity exceeds the target. The primary reason for the B2 classification is likely the sentence 'Hopefully, the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up the change.' The 'enough for X to Y' construction, particularly with a longer noun phrase like 'Earth-based telescopes', can be challenging for a B1 reader. To achieve a B1 level, consider simplifying this structure. For example, you could split it into two sentences: 'Hopefully, the impact of DART will knock it out of its orbit. Earth-based telescopes should then be able to see this change.' This would reduce the cognitive load and improve B1 readability.",

While the text is clear, factually accurate, and maintains high meaning and fidelity scores (MeaningBERT: 0.945, BERTScore: 0.9642), certain grammatical structures and phrasing contribute to a higher complexity than B1. For example, the use of the relative clause 'which stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test' and the appositive 'a large space rock' in the second sentence, while helpful for clarity, elevate the overall linguistic demand. Similarly, the sentence ''Didymoon', which is 150 metres wide, orbits its 800-metre mother asteroid' uses a non-restrictive relative clause. To achieve a B1 level, consider breaking down some of these more complex sentences or rephrasing them using simpler conjunctions or separate sentences. For instance, 'DART. This means Double Asteroid Redirection Test.' or 'Didymos is an asteroid. It is a large space rock.' could be simpler alternatives. The overall density of information within single sentences, even with clarifications, also contributes to the B2 classification.",

The primary reason for this classification is the use of the word 'means' in the sentence 'This means Double Asteroid Redirection Test'. According to the provided vocabulary candidates, 'means' is a B2-level word. To achieve B1 compliance, this should be replaced with a simpler alternative. For example, 'This stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test' or 'DART is short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test' would be more appropriate for a B1 audience. Additionally, while the sentence structure was simplified effectively, the overall density of scientific vocabulary such as 'scheduled', 'impact', 'orbit', and 'telescopes' might collectively contribute to a higher perceived complexity, even if individually these words can appear at B1. Reviewing these terms for potential simplification or rephrasing could further solidify the text at the B1 level.",
