This indicates a substantial loss or alteration of the core message and its impact from the original text. The simplification strategy has softened the urgency and severity of the environmental issues described. For instance: The original phrase 'reverse the damage' implies undoing existing harm, but the output's 'stop the harm' focuses more on prevention, subtly shifting the core intent. The powerful imagery of 'environmental destruction' and 'underwater deserts, devoid of life' was reduced to 'harm to nature' and 'places... that have no living things', which diminishes the gravity and vividness of Lewis's observations. To improve, ensure that simplifications retain the full emotional and conceptual weight of the original message, even when using simpler vocabulary.",

While the factual information is preserved, the simplification strategy resulted in a shift in the semantic nuance and register of the text. For example, replacing 'marine protected areas' with 'sea protected areas', 'expeditions' with 'trips', and 'polluting' with 'making the water dirty' are individually acceptable simplifications. However, the cumulative effect of these lexical choices, moving from more precise or formal terms to more general or colloquial ones, altered the overall meaning and tone. The original text conveyed a more scientific and urgent tone, which was somewhat diluted. To improve, ensure that lexical simplifications retain the specific implications and register of the original phrasing. For instance, consider if 'marine protected areas' could be retained or explained more directly, and if 'polluting' is a more precise term than 'making the water dirty' even at a B1 level.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is due to a combination of advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures. Specifically, words like 'destruction' (B2), 'shallow' (B2), and 'unsolvable' (B2) were retained from the original text, making the vocabulary too challenging for a B1 reader. Additionally, the first sentence, 'Lewis would like to see the number of marine protected areas in the world increase from 3% to 10% in an attempt to reverse the damage caused by human activity such as overfishing, polluting and littering,' is 39 words long and contains multiple clauses, which pushes its complexity beyond B1. Similarly, the sentence defining coral, 'He has swum over coral, which is a hard, colourful material made by small sea animals, that has lost its colour because the water got hotter, and observed underwater deserts beneath the shallow waters of the Red Sea, with no life and covered with plastic,' is 54 words long and overly complex for B1. To achieve B1 compliance, replace B2 vocabulary with simpler alternatives (e.g., 'destruction' -> 'damage', 'shallow' -> 'not deep', 'unsolvable' -> 'a problem we cannot fix'). Also, break down long, multi-clause sentences into shorter, more manageable sentences. For example, the coral sentence could be split into two or three sentences to improve readability for a B1 audience.",

Both MeaningBERT (0.8225) and BERTScore (0.9473) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is highly effective. Longer, more complex sentences from the original text have been skillfully broken down into shorter, more manageable B1-level sentences, significantly improving readability without sacrificing detail. For example, the original's single complex sentence about Lewis's observations was transformed into four clear sentences, including an excellent, well-integrated definition of 'coral'. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, with more complex terms like 'bleached', 'devoid of life', 'strewn with plastic', and 'unsolvable' being replaced with simpler, B1-friendly alternatives such as 'lost its colour', 'had no life', 'covered with plastic', and 'problem we cannot fix'. The use of B1 connectors is natural and aids the flow of the text. This is a very strong submission, demonstrating a clear understanding of simplification principles and B1 CEFR requirements.",
