    "text_translated": "Lewis wants to see more marine protected areas in the world. He would like the number to increase from 3% to 10%. This is to stop the damage caused by human activities like overfishing, polluting, and littering. During his expeditions, Lewis has witnessed this environmental damage first-hand. He has swum over **coral**, which is a hard, colourful material made by small sea animals. This coral has lost its colour because the water got hotter. He also saw underwater deserts beneath the not deep waters of the Red Sea. These places had no life and were covered with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if it is given space to do so, but the clock is ticking. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have a problem we cannot fix on our hands.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained throughout, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Both MeaningBERT (0.8225) and BERTScore (0.9473) exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as 'B1', demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target level. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is highly effective. Longer, more complex sentences from the original text have been skillfully broken down into shorter, more manageable B1-level sentences, significantly improving readability without sacrificing detail. For example, the original's single complex sentence about Lewis's observations was transformed into four clear sentences, including an excellent, well-integrated definition of 'coral'. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, with more complex terms like 'bleached', 'devoid of life', 'strewn with plastic', and 'unsolvable' being replaced with simpler, B1-friendly alternatives such as 'lost its colour', 'had no life', 'covered with plastic', and 'problem we cannot fix'. The use of B1 connectors is natural and aids the flow of the text. This is a very strong submission, demonstrating a clear understanding of simplification principles and B1 CEFR requirements.",
