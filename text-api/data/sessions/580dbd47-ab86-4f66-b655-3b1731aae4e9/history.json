This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core concepts due to oversimplification.\n\n- The original text's central idea is the emergence of 'early human civilisation'. Your version replaces this with 'people started to change', which is too vague and fails to convey this essential concept.\n- The original states that humans became 'more complex and more intelligent'. Your text reduces this to 'smarter', completely omitting the crucial concept of increasing complexity.\n- The original questions the 'connection' between cave paintings and language. Your version narrows this to 'if this happened because of language', which changes the meaning from a general link to a direct cause.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to include the concept of 'civilisation' using A2 vocabulary, such as 'how people started to live together'. Reintroduce the idea of complexity. The text must accurately reflect the original's key ideas, not just its surface-level facts.",
