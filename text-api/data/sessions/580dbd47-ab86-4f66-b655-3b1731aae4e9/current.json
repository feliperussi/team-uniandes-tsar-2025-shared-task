    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a model example of A2 simplification and meets all protocol requirements.\n- Factual Integrity: The core message, timeframes, and central questions from the original text are preserved without error.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8093 and BERTScore of 0.9325 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. Words like 'civilisation' and 'develop' were correctly simplified to 'society' and 'get better'.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's complex sentences and clauses have been broken down into short, clear, and independent sentences. The use of basic connectors like 'But' and 'So' is appropriate for the A2 level.",
