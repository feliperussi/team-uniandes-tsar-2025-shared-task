When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about a hero called Theseus and a monster called the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens was ruled by another place called Crete, but the people of Athens fought against their rulers. As a punishment, the king of Crete made the people of Athens send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were put into a special maze and eaten by the Minotaur, which was a monster that lived there. However, one of the young men, whose name was Theseus, fought the Minotaur and killed it. Suzanne Collins thinks that Katniss Everdeen is like a modern Theseus from the future.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.70 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a loss of the original text's core message. The simplification was too aggressive, weakening key concepts. For example, changing the violent action \"thrown into the labyrinth\" to the neutral phrase \"put into a special maze\" loses the sense of cruelty central to the punishment. Similarly, reducing \"inspiration\" to \"idea\" understates the depth of the connection to the myth. The text also failed the CEFR compliance check, being classified as A2 instead of the target B1. This was caused by the over-simplification of vocabulary (e.g., \"mythology\" to \"stories\"). To improve, revise the text to use stronger, more precise B1-level vocabulary that better reflects the meaning and severity of the original passage, such as using \"forced into a maze\" instead of \"put into a special maze\". This will help raise both the meaning preservation score and the CEFR level.",

Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.865) and BERTScore (0.9647) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is highly effective, particularly the simplification of 'labyrinth' to 'large maze' and 'futuristic Theseus' to 'a version of Theseus from the future'. The consistent use of the past tense creates a clear and easy-to-follow narrative. For a perfect score, the C1-level word 'inspiration' could have been simplified to a more common B1 alternative like 'idea'. Overall, this is a high-quality and successful simplification.",
