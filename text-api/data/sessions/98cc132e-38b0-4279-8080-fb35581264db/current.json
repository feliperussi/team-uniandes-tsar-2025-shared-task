    "text_translated": "An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book came from Suzanne's love of Greek mythology. When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was about a hero called Theseus and a monster called the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens was ruled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought against their rulers. As a punishment, the king of Crete forced the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were thrown into a large maze and eaten by the Minotaur, a monster that lived there. However, one of the young men, whose name was Theseus, fought the Minotaur and killed it. Suzanne Collins sees Katniss Everdeen as a version of Theseus from the future.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.865) and BERTScore (0.9647) are well above the required thresholds, indicating strong preservation of the original message. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The vocabulary strategy is highly effective, particularly the simplification of 'labyrinth' to 'large maze' and 'futuristic Theseus' to 'a version of Theseus from the future'. The consistent use of the past tense creates a clear and easy-to-follow narrative. For a perfect score, the C1-level word 'inspiration' could have been simplified to a more common B1 alternative like 'idea'. Overall, this is a high-quality and successful simplification.",
