    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks that fly through space, and they can be dangerous if they pass within 7.5 million kilometres of the Earth. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids, but they have said that none of them will be a danger in the next one hundred years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects and predict a possible impact, and if this happens, two different plans could be used to protect the planet.",
