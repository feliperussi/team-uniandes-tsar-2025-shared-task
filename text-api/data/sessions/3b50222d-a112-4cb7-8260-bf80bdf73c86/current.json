    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7359 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- The primary reason for the low score is the oversimplification of the concept 'raise awareness about a range of environmental issues'. Your version, 'tell people it is important to help our world', loses the specific meaning of making people understand existing problems.\n- The original text uses 'dreamt' (past tense), while your version uses 'dream' (present tense). This subtle shift contributes to the meaning deviation.\n- The vocabulary analysis flags 'mount' (B2) and 'pole' (C1). While these are part of proper nouns (Mount Everest, South Pole), their inclusion elevates the text's complexity beyond a pure A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about nature to better reflect the original's intent. Change 'They want to tell people it is important to help our world' to something more direct like 'They want to show people the problems in our world.' This better captures the concept of 'raising awareness' using A2 vocabulary.",
