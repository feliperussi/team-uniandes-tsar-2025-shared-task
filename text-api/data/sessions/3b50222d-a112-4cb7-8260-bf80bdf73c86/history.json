This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text presents a connected profile of the modern adventurer, contrasting them with the past and linking their different motivations. Your version breaks these connected ideas into a series of simple, disconnected facts, losing the overall narrative and semantic relationship between the concepts.\n\n- Deviation: The original text uses 'Unlike the explorers of the past...' to create a direct and strong comparison. Your version, 'In the past, explorers used maps. Today, adventurers are different,' is a weaker, less direct comparison that contributes to the loss of meaning.\n- Deviation: The original text connects the two motivations of adventurers with the phrase 'while others are keen...'. This shows they are two sides of the same coin. Your version separates them into two different paragraphs, completely severing this link and damaging the core message.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by re-establishing the connections. Combine the sentences about the two types of adventurers to show they are related. For example: 'Some adventurers love nature and want to help our world, and other adventurers want to collect money for people who need help.' This restores the relationship that was lost.",

While these are part of proper nouns or common collocations (Mount Everest, satellite phones), their presence increases the text's complexity and is a deviation from the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts from the original text using simpler A2 phrasing.

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The simplification, while aiming for A2, was too aggressive and altered the meaning beyond acceptable limits. The text is factually correct and meets the A2 classification, but the meaning preservation failure is absolute and cannot be overlooked.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- MeaningBERT Score Failure: The score of 0.734 is unacceptable. The phrase 'raise awareness about a range of environmental issues' was reduced to 'tell people about problems with our world'. This simplification lost the concept of 'awareness' and the 'range' of issues. Similarly, 'help people in need' was reduced to 'help people', losing the critical qualifier 'in need'.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the core concepts more accurately while simplifying. Rephrase to restore the lost meaning. Instead of 'tell people about problems with our world', use a phrase like 'tell people it is important to help our world'. To correct the second error, change 'help people' to 'help people who need it'. This maintains A2 simplicity while improving semantic fidelity.",
