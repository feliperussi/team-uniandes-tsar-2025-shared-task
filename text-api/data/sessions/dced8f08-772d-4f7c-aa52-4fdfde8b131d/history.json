They are 140 metres wide or more.\n\nScientists think there are 25,000 of this size. NASA knows about 8,000 now. So 17,000 are not on the list yet.\n\nIn 2013, a 19-metre asteroid exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia. It hurt about 1,200 people.\n\nSo middle-sized asteroids can be a serious danger. They can be a danger if they come near Earth.",

The original text emphasizes logging asteroids to track them, but your version says make a list, losing the nuance of systematic tracking. The original warns that asteroids could enter Earth's orbit, but you wrote come near Earth, which shifts the specific hazard context.",
