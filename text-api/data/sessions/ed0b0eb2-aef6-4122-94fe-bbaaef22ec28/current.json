    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8973 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text. While simplification is the goal, too much lexical detail was lost, causing the text to fail this critical metric.\n\n- Deviation 1 (BERTScore): The replacement of phrases like 'terrible situation' with 'bad situation', 'incredible poverty' with 'very poor', and 'governed by' with 'rule them' contributed to the score dropping below the minimum threshold.\n- Deviation 2 (Keywords): The keyword 'transformation' was provided for definition but was not defined in the output. The protocol requires that provided keywords are defined in simple A2 terms.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to retain more specific vocabulary from the original text without increasing sentence complexity. You must define all provided keywords. Add a sentence such as: 'A transformation is a very big change.'",
