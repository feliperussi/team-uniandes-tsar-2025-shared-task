The simplification was too aggressive, losing important lexical detail.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B2-level word 'means' in the definition 'Transformation means a big change.'. The word 'being' is also B2 and is used in a grammatically complex way for A2.\n\n- Structural Violation: The phrase 'They left being very poor' uses a gerund ('being'). This is a B1/B2 grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard of simple sentences.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase the definition to 'Transformation is a big change.' to remove the B2 word.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase 'They left being very poor' to a simple A2 structure, such as 'They are not very poor now.'\n\n- Suggestion: To correct the fidelity score, re-introduce more precise A2-level vocabulary from the original where possible.

Replacing 'millions more girls' and 'millions of people' with the vague term 'Many more' loses lexical precision and factual weight. Additionally, there is a vocabulary violation.

The text also fails on CEFR compliance, with the classifier rating it B1 instead of the required A2.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is too low. Replacing original phrases like 'have access to' with 'can get' and 'increased their income' with 'made more money' resulted in a loss of lexical fidelity, even if the general meaning was preserved.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1. This is an automatic failure. The cause is the use of B1-level vocabulary and grammar.\n- B1 Vocabulary: The word 'truth' is B1 level and is not permitted in an A2 text.\n- B1 Grammar: The sentence 'The truth is that a great transformation is happening' uses a 'that-clause', which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n- C1 Vocabulary: The word 'transformation' is C1 level. While providing a definition is correct procedure, using the word itself elevates the text's complexity and contributed to the B1 classification.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to restore fidelity. Use phrases closer to the original, such as 'can use clean water' instead of 'can get clean water'.\n- Suggestion: Remove the B1 word 'truth' and the B1 'that-clause'. Rewrite the sentence. Example: 'Actually, this is not correct. A great transformation is happening.'\n- Suggestion: Do not use the C1 word 'transformation'. Replace it directly with its A2 definition.

While the text is well-simplified for the A2 level, it deviates too far from the source to pass.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The BERTScore is too low. This is a result of replacing key phrases with simpler, but lexically distant, alternatives. For example, 'increased their income' was replaced with 'have more money', and 'have access to' was replaced with 'can get'. These changes caused the fidelity score to drop below the minimum requirement.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The C1 word 'transformation' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms. This was executed correctly. However, the vocabulary list incorrectly identifies 'run' as A1; in the context 'run by dictators', it is a phrasal verb with a meaning closer to B1 ('govern' or 'manage').\n- Structural Compliance: The use of short, simple sentences is appropriate for the A2 level and meets the standard.\n\nSuggestion: To meet the fidelity requirement, retain more of the original key words during simplification. The goal is to reduce complexity, not completely replace the original vocabulary. Rephrase 'people can get clean water' to 'people have clean water' to stay closer to the original 'have access to'. Re-evaluate the simplification of 'increased their income' to find a closer A2 equivalent.",
