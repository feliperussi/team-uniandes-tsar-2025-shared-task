While the text successfully maintained factual integrity and preserved the original meaning, as shown by the high MeaningBERT and BERTScore metrics, its sentence structure is too advanced. The B2 classification is likely due to complex sentences. For instance, the sentence 'Using technology that is already available, NASA can track these asteroids and predict if one might hit Earth' begins with a participial phrase and contains a relative clause. Similarly, the sentence 'If an impact is predicted, there are two defence solutions that could be used' combines a conditional structure with two instances of the passive voice. To meet the B1 target, these sentences should be simplified. Suggestion: Rewrite the first example as 'NASA has technology that is already available. They can use it to track these asteroids and predict if one might hit Earth.' This breaks the complex sentence into two simpler, more direct sentences.",

Suggestion: Split the first sentence into two simpler ones, such as 'Asteroids are large rocks that travel in space. Some of them are called Potentially Hazardous.'

The submission passed the highest priority checks for Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation, with excellent scores for MeaningBERT (0.94) and BERTScore (0.92). However, the CEFR failure is critical. The B2 classification was likely caused by retaining the phrase 'Potentially Hazardous'. The word 'Potentially' is B2-level vocabulary. While keeping the official term is good for accuracy, it pushed the text outside the target CEFR band. Suggestion: To correct this, rephrase the sentence to explain the term using simpler language. For example: 'Some of these asteroids are called 'Potentially Hazardous', which means they could become a danger to Earth.'",
