    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7316 is below the 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8657 is below the 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and key vocabulary of the original text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. This is an automatic failure.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B1): The word 'challenge' is B1. It was used directly instead of being simplified. The words 'growth', 'effort', and 'fixed' are also B1.\n- Vocabulary Violation (B2): The word 'means' is B2. It was used in the keyword definitions, which is a severe error.\n- Defective Definitions: The definitions for 'growth mindset' and 'fixed mindset' are invalid because they introduce higher-level vocabulary ('means', 'effort') instead of explaining the concepts in simple A2 terms.\n- Typographical Error: The text contains the error 'more4'. This level of carelessness is unacceptable.\n\nSuggestion: Rewrite the text to restore the original meaning more accurately. Remove all B1 and B2 vocabulary. The word 'challenge' must be rephrased using A2 words like 'a hard new thing'. The definitions must be rewritten using only A1/A2 vocabulary. For example: 'A growth mindset is when you think you can get better if you try hard.' Proofread the final text to eliminate all errors.",
