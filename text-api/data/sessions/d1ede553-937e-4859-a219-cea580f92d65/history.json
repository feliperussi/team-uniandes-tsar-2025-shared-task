        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8679 is below the required 0.90. This is the primary reason for failure. The text also fails the CEFR compliance check.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because key lexical items from the original text were replaced with overly simplistic phrases, losing precision. For example, 'cheat' was replaced with 'break rules' and 'boost their self-esteem' was replaced with 'made them feel better about themselves'. This damages the fidelity to the source text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an instant failure. The cause is the keyword definitions you added.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The definitions introduce B-level vocabulary. The word 'means' is B2. The words 'growth', 'effort', and 'fixed' are B1. The task is to define complex terms using A2 language, not to introduce more complex words.\n\n- Structural Violation: The sentences 'A growth mindset means a person believes they can improve with effort' and 'A fixed mindset means a person believes they cannot change their abilities' use a structure that is too complex for A2. The combination of 'means' and a subordinate clause ('a person believes...') elevates the complexity to B1.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to restore key words from the original to meet the 0.90 BERTScore threshold. Rewrite the keyword definitions entirely. Use only A1/A2 vocabulary and simple 'Subject-Verb-Object' sentence structures. Example: 'A growth mindset is an idea. People with this idea think they can learn and get better.'",

This indicates a critical loss of lexical detail and key concepts from the original text.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, which is an immediate failure. The target level is A2.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses unsimplified B1 and B2 level vocabulary. 'cheat' (B1), 'boost' (B2), and 'self-esteem' (B2) were taken directly from the source text. These words are not on the A2 list and must be replaced.\n- Structural Complexity: The text contains grammatical structures above the A2 level, contributing to the B1 classification. The sentence 'They focused on what they could reach' uses a noun clause, a B1 structure. The sentence 'Others looked for a child who did not do as well' uses a relative clause that is too complex for A2.\n- Meaning Loss: The simplification is excessive, leading to a loss of core meaning. The original's 'reacted positively, said they loved challenge' was reduced to 'liked the hard task', which fails to convey the essential concept of embracing difficulty for growth.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to restore lost meaning. Replace 'liked the hard task' with 'was happy with the hard task. They thought they could learn.' Remove all B1/B2 vocabulary. Replace 'cheat' with 'not follow the rules'. Replace 'boost their self-esteem' with 'feel better about themselves'. Break down complex sentences. Change 'a child who did not do as well' to 'another child. This child did not do well.'",

For example, the concept 'boost their self-esteem' was replaced with 'made them feel better about themselves', which loses lexical precision and causes the score to drop.\n\nCEFR Compliance Failure: The CEFR classifier rated the text as B1, which is an automatic failure. The A2 standard was not met. This is caused by two main issues:\n1. Vocabulary: You used multiple B1-level words directly in the text, including 'challenge', 'growth', 'fixed', and 'cheat'. These words are not on the A2 list and must be replaced or explained using only A2 vocabulary.\n2. Sentence Structure: The sentence 'A growth mindset is when they think they can improve' uses a defining clause with 'when', which is a B1 grammatical structure.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the text to remove all B1 vocabulary.

The original explains *why* the groups felt differently ('abilities could be developed' vs. 'intelligence was being judged'). Your version removes this essential explanation, reducing the text to a simple list of actions.\n\n- Vocabulary Non-Compliance: The text uses multiple B1 and B2 level words, which is a direct violation of the A2 standard. 'challenge', 'intelligence', 'failed', and 'cheat' are all too advanced for this level.\n\n- Structural Weakness: While the sentences are short, the complete lack of simple connectors makes the text choppy and difficult to follow. The relationship between ideas is lost.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to explain the *reason* for the children's feelings, not just the feelings themselves. Replace all B1/B2 vocabulary immediately. 'intelligence' must be simplified to 'how smart they are'. 'failed' must be simplified to 'did not do well'. 'cheat' must be simplified to 'not follow the rules'.",

The text fails on multiple high-priority checks.\n\nPrimary Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.5992 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The original's specific concept of children wanting to 'cheat' was diluted to 'not follow the rules', which is a different and weaker meaning.\n\nSecondary Failures:\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8626 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing essential vocabulary such as 'intelligence', 'judged', 'failed', and 'cheat'. The text has lost too much lexical detail from the source.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text as B1, not the required A2. The inclusion of the B1-level keywords 'growth' and 'fixed' without simplification or definition caused this misclassification.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 words 'growth' and 'fixed' were used directly. For A2 compliance, these terms must be explained using simple A2 vocabulary, not just stated.\n\nCorrective Actions:\n- Restore the original meaning. The concept of 'cheating' must be reinstated. Rephrase 'not follow the rules' to something like 'Some children said they might cheat next time'.\n- Re-integrate key concepts. The idea of intelligence being 'judged' must be restored using A2-compliant language.\n- Address the B1 keywords. You must explain what a 'growth mindset' is using only A2 words. Do not use the B1 term itself in the main body of the text.",
