    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5427 is critically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe loss of the original message. The simplification has distorted the core concepts.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8594 is also below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts from the original text were lost.\n- Meaning Distortion: The original concept of positive feedback becoming 'devalued' (losing importance) was incorrectly simplified to 'not needed anymore'. This is a factual misrepresentation of the original meaning.\n- Grammatical Error: The sentence 'When a good comment, then a bad one follows.' is grammatically incomplete and incorrect for any CEFR level. It lacks a proper clause structure.\n- Over-simplification: The attempt to reach A2 level resulted in a text that is choppy and fails to convey the original's advice with any accuracy.\n\nSuggestion: You must rewrite the text to preserve the original meaning. The concept of 'devalued' must be rephrased correctly, for example: 'the good words start to feel less important'. Correct the incomplete sentence to a full, simple sentence like 'If a bad comment always follows a good one, people will ignore the good comment.'.",
