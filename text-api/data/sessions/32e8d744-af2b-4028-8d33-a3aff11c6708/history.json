The original text states that positive feedback becomes 'devalued', meaning it loses its worth. Your version changes this to 'seem not nice', which is a different and much weaker concept, failing to preserve the core message.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.87 is below the 0.90 threshold. This is due to the inconsistent replacement of the key term 'feedback' with the more generic word 'comment' after the first sentence.\n- Inconsistent Terminology: You define 'feedback' in the first sentence but then switch to using 'comment' for the rest of the text. This is confusing and contributes to the low fidelity score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of 'losing value'. Rephrase 'seem not nice' to something like 'the good feedback will not seem important' or 'people will stop believing the positive feedback'. Use the key term 'feedback' consistently after you define it.",
