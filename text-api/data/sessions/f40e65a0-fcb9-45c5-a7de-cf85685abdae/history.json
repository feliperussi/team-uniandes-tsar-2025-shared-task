It combines a subordinate clause ('Although...'), a non-defining relative clause ('which leads to...'), and a colon within a single, long sentence. To meet the B1 requirement, this should be broken into two or three shorter sentences. For example: 'Although their brains did not get bigger, humans became more complex and intelligent. This leads to an important question. Did using language cause their brains to develop, or did their brains start to create language?'.

While the simplification successfully preserved all facts and the core meaning, it was overly effective for the B1 level. The complexity was likely reduced by the combination of replacing words like 'evidence' with the simpler 'signs' and using very direct sentence structures. The addition of the simple introductory sentence, 'This leads to an important question,' further lowered the linguistic complexity score. To elevate the text to B1, consider rephrasing the final part to use a more complex but still clear structure, for example: 'This raises the question of whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to create language.'
