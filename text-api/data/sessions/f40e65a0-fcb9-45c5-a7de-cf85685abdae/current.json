    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The primary reason for this is the syntactic complexity of the first sentence: 'However, between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we start to see signs of early human civilisation in cave paintings, although the connection between this and language is not known.' This sentence is too long for a B1 level and uses a subordinate clause with 'although', which increases its complexity. Suggestion: Split this into two simpler sentences to meet the B1 target. For example: 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we start to see signs of early human civilisation in cave paintings. However, the connection between these paintings and language is not known.'",

This raises the question of whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to create language.",
