    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6926 is too low, falling below the required 0.75. The original text conveys a nuanced idea of items being purchased but 'not being put to good use' or being underutilized, implying a degree of waste or inefficiency. The writer's output simplifies this to 'we do not use all of them', which loses the specific meaning of 'good use' or the implied regret/observation about underutilization. The core message about the *quality* or *sufficiency* of use is diminished. Suggestion: Rephrase the introductory sentences to more accurately reflect the concept of items being bought but not used effectively or sufficiently, rather than just stating they are not used.",
