The core message of the original text is that Wasfia's actions are a direct response to a culture that 'discourages' women from sport. Your version states her motivation but loses this critical cause-and-effect link, which fundamentally alters the text's purpose. The BERTScore of 0.8949 is also below the 0.90 minimum, confirming a loss of key phrasing. Additionally, there is a severe vocabulary violation. The word 'empower' is C1 level and is unacceptable for an A2 text. You attempted to explain it with simpler sentences but then used the complex word itself in the final sentence. Suggestion: Restore the lost meaning. State clearly that people in her country think girls should not do sports, and this is the reason she acts. Remove the word 'empower' completely. The preceding sentences are sufficient for the A2 level.",
