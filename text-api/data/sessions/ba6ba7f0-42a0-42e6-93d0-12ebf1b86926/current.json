    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6796 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message.\n\nFidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8962 is also below the 0.90 minimum. Key lexical concepts were lost during simplification.\n\nMeaning Loss: The original text's central idea is that Wasfia acts 'to empower women and girls'. Your version, 'to show that girls can be strong', is a different and weaker concept. The meaning of 'empowerment' has been lost.\n\nNuance Loss: The original states the country 'discourages' girls from sport. Your version, 'many people say girls should not do sports', fails to capture the active sense of discouragement.\n\nSuggestion: The simplification was too aggressive, sacrificing meaning for simplicity. You must rephrase the final sentence to restore the concept of 'empowerment' in A2 terms. For example: 'She does this to help girls in her country feel powerful and believe they can do sports.'",
