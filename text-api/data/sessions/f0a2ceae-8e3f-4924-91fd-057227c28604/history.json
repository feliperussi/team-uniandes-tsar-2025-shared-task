The text fails the qualitative audit due to the inclusion of a word outside the A2 vocabulary list.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'percent' is classified as B1 level. It was used in the sentence: 'We forget 95 to 99 percent of them.' This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n- Structural Compliance: The use of short, simple sentences is correct for the A2 level.\n- Metrics: The text passed all quantitative checks (MeaningBERT: 0.8348, BERTScore: 0.9087, CEFR Classifier: A2), but this does not override the qualitative failure.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence to avoid the B1 word. Use a construction like 'out of every 100' to explain the concept in A2 terms. For example: 'We forget 95 to 99 of every 100 dreams.'",

It meets all diagnostic criteria without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All data points from the original text, including the number of dreams, ages, and percentages, are preserved with 100% accuracy.\n\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8353 and BERTScore of 0.9096 confirm that the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids the B1 complexity of the original while providing more substance than a simple A1 text.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'coincidence' to 'by chance' and the breakdown of the final complex sentence into five simple, sequential sentences is a perfect execution of A2 structural requirements. No violations were detected.",
