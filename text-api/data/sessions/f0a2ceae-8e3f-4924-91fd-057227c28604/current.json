    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. It meets all diagnostic criteria without deviation.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All data points from the original text, including the number of dreams, ages, and percentages, are preserved with 100% accuracy.\n\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8353 and BERTScore of 0.9096 confirm that the core message and key lexical items have been successfully retained.\n\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids the B1 complexity of the original while providing more substance than a simple A1 text.\n\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. The simplification of 'coincidence' to 'by chance' and the breakdown of the final complex sentence into five simple, sequential sentences is a perfect execution of A2 structural requirements. No violations were detected.",
