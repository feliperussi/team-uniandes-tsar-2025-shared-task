The text also fails the CEFR compliance check, registering as B1 instead of the required A2.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): Key concepts like 'cultural differences' were oversimplified to 'different', and 'initiative and creative freedom' became 'choice and new ideas'. This simplification sacrifices too much lexical detail from the source.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure (B1 Classification): The text was classified as B1, which is too complex. This is due to specific vocabulary and grammatical choices.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The words 'trust', 'personally', and the phrase 'used to' are all B1 level and are not permitted.\n\n- B1 Grammar Violation: The sentence 'They explained that this was how they always worked' uses a 'that-clause' and a 'how-clause', which are B1 structures. The phrase 'her being leader' is also grammatically too complex for the A2 level.\n\n- Suggestion: Replace all B1 vocabulary. The word 'trust' must be rephrased using A2 words, for example, 'they felt she did not think they could do a good job'. Break down all complex sentences.

This loses the important A2/B1 concepts of 'initiative' and 'creativity'.\n- Evidence 2: The original phrase 'challenge or make changes to her decisions' was reduced to 'asked about her decisions'. This is a factual weakening. 'Challenging' a decision is fundamentally different from 'asking about' it.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. The phrase 'asked about her decisions' must be rephrased to include the concept of 'challenge' or 'change'. The phrase 'chance to decide' must be expanded to better reflect 'creative freedom'.",

This makes the text read like a list of A1 sentences rather than a coherent A2 paragraph.

The goal is simple, not simplistic.\n\nSuggestion: Combine some of the short sentences using simple connectors to show the relationship between ideas. Reintroduce more precise A2 vocabulary to increase fidelity. For example: 'She told them exactly what to do, so they felt she did not trust them.' This connects the two ideas and uses the more accurate A2 word 'trust'.",

Key concepts were rephrased instead of being simplified directly.\n- Example 1: The original's 'felt that she didn't trust them' was changed to 'felt she thought they could not do a good job'. This alters the specific meaning from trust to capability.\n- Example 2: The original's 'taking it personally' was changed to 'felt upset'. This loses the specific nuance of the original phrase.\n- The final two sentences are repetitive: 'The team said it was their normal way to work.' is immediately followed by 'The team explained their normal way to work.' This is inefficient.\n\nSuggestion: Revise the text to retain more of the original's key vocabulary. The goal is simplification, not complete rephrasing. Restore the concept of 'trust'. Remove the final repetitive sentence.",

This indicates a critical loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text, resulting in a distorted summary.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The words 'trust' and 'personally' are B1 level. They are not permitted. This is a direct violation of the A2 standard.\n- Omission of Core Meaning: The original text states the team was 'pleased to be asked'. Your version omits this crucial emotional detail, which changes the entire tone of the interaction.\n- Loss of Causality: The original text explains a cause-and-effect relationship: the team realized Gabriela took things personally *when* they tried to challenge her. Your version breaks this into two disconnected sentences ('The team said Gabriela took it personally. They tried to change her decisions.'), which destroys the original logic.\n- Vague Language: The original's specific concept of 'cultural differences' was replaced with the vague 'different ways of working', losing important context.\n- Grammatical Error: The phrase 'a open talk' is incorrect. It must be 'an open talk'.\n\nSuggestion: Re-write the text to restore the missing information. Replace the B1 vocabulary immediately. Instead of 'did not trust them', use 'thought they could not do the job well'. Reconnect the sentences to show that the team's challenges made Gabriela feel bad personally. The text must accurately reflect the key facts and feelings of the original source.",

It does not clearly refer back to 'Gabriela felt bad'.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the grammatical error immediately. Rephrase the sentence containing 'being' to use only A1/A2 vocabulary, for example, 'They did not like it when people told them what to do'. Restore the lost concepts using simpler A2 terms.
