This is an unacceptable error and an instant failure. The text also fails on multiple subsequent checks. The BERTScore of 0.8954 is below the required 0.90, indicating a loss of key phrasing. Furthermore, the text fails CEFR compliance. The classifier rated it B1, not the required A2. Linguistic evidence for the B1 classification includes a complex sentence structure and non-compliant vocabulary. The sentence 'They also show things for the face they suggest to buy' uses a reduced relative clause, which is a B1 structure. The text uses the B1 word 'goods' in the phrase 'electrical goods'. Suggestion: Proofread the output to remove corrupted text. Rephrase the complex sentence into two simple sentences. Example: 'They show things for the face. They suggest people buy them.' Replace the B1 word 'goods' with an A2 alternative like 'items' or 'things'.",

The words 'influencers' and 'services' are B1-level concepts that are not appropriate for an A2 audience without definition.\n\n- Structural Deficiency: The text is a series of disconnected, short sentences. This makes it choppy and unnatural. A2 level requires the ability to link simple ideas with connectors like 'and' or 'so'.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore key phrases from the original text, such as 'buy nothing trend', to meet the fidelity requirement. Replace B1 vocabulary; use 'people on social media' instead of 'influencers'. Rephrase the sentence 'they gave up services' to 'they stopped paying for things'. Combine some sentences using 'and' to improve the flow. Example: 'Influencers often show clothes and make-up, and they tell people to buy them.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8821 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The term 'influencers' was replaced with the more general 'famous people', losing specific meaning. The phrase 'working towards' was simplified to 'trying', which changes the nuance of the original message.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the B1 word 'goods' in the phrase 'electrical goods'. This is not A2 compliant. An A2 text must not contain B1 vocabulary.\n\n- Structural Issue: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This makes the text choppy and unnatural. While A2 requires simple sentences, this level of fragmentation is excessive.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore key terms like 'influencers' to meet the fidelity requirement. Replace the B1 word 'goods' with an A2 alternative like 'items' or 'things'. Combine some of the short sentences using 'and' to improve the text's flow.",
