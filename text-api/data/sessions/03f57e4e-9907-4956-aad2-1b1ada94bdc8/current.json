    "feedback": "FAIL: Vocabulary Audit. The text contains vocabulary that exceeds the A2 CEFR standard. The word 'religion' is explicitly listed as a B1 level word in the provided 'Vocabulary Candidates for Replacement'. It is used multiple times throughout the text without being simplified or defined in A2 terms, which is a direct violation of the A2 vocabulary requirement. While the CEFR classifier rated the text as A2, the presence of a B1 word without appropriate handling constitutes a failure under strict A2 compliance. All other metrics (Factual Integrity, MeaningBERT, BERTScore) passed. The sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2. Suggestion: Replace the word 'religion' with simpler A2 phrases such as 'way of believing in God' or 'beliefs about God' or provide a clear, simple A2 definition for 'religion' the first time it is used.",
