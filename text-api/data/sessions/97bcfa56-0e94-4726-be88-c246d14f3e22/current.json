    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability standards and accurately reflects the original content. The Factual Integrity Check found no discrepancies. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8592 and BERTScore of 0.9055 both exceed the minimum requirements, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely appropriate for an A2 level, with no complex words or structures detected. Sentences are short and simple, and connectors are limited to basic A1/A2 forms. This is a perfectly executed A2 simplification.",
