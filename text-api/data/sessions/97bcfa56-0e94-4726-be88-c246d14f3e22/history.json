MeaningBERT (0.8592) and BERTScore (0.9055) metrics are well within acceptable limits, indicating excellent preservation of core message and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms the use of simple, short sentences and A2-appropriate vocabulary. The simplification of 'facial deformities' to 'different face', 'bestseller' to 'Many people bought', and 'bullying' to 'bad things people do' are exemplary A2 adaptations. The use of 'being' in 'being friends' and 'being different' is grammatically appropriate for A2. No deviations from the strict A2 standard were detected.",
