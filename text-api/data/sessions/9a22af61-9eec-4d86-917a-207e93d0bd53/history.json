The simplification strategy of defining 'coincidence' within the sentence was excellent. However, the final output fails because it does not meet the target B1 level and was instead classified as A2. The resulting text is grammatically correct and clear, but its vocabulary and sentence structure are too simple for the B1 target. To improve, the text needs slightly more structural complexity. Suggestion: Combine the two sentences to create a single, more complex sentence that is characteristic of the B1 level, for example: 'Dreams about events like a phone call from an old friend or a death are more likely a coincidence rather than a sign of the future, especially because we tend to forget all the times these dreams do not happen in real life.'"

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The primary failure is a mismatch between the target CEFR level (B1) and the classification result ('A2'). While the text passed the critical checks for factual integrity and meaning preservation (MeaningBERT score of 0.89 is excellent), the structural choices led to the incorrect CEFR classification. The original two sentences were combined into a single, overly long sentence connected by 'which' and 'because'. This structure is stylistically poor for a B1 learner and difficult to process. The classifier likely rated the text as A2 due to the simple vocabulary, but the sentence itself is not a good model of clear B1 writing. \n\nActionable Suggestion: To meet the B1 target, break the long sentence into two or three shorter, clearer sentences. For example: 'Dreams about a phone call from an old friend are more likely to be a coincidence. A coincidence is when things happen by chance. This is because we probably forget all the times we have these dreams and they do not happen in real life.' This revision improves readability and better reflects B1-level structure."

Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT score of 0.8825 is well above the required threshold, confirming that the core message was preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The standout feature of this simplification is the strategic handling of vocabulary: the B2 word 'coincidence' was used and then immediately defined in simple terms ('A coincidence is when things happen by chance.'). This is a model technique for making complex ideas accessible to a B1 audience. The text is well-structured and flows logically."
