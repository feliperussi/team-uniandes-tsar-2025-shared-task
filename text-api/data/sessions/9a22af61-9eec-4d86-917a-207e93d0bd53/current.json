This is because we probably forget all the times we have dreams about these events, but they do not happen in real life.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT score of 0.8825 is well above the required threshold, confirming that the core message was preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. The standout feature of this simplification is the strategic handling of vocabulary: the B2 word 'coincidence' was used and then immediately defined in simple terms ('A coincidence is when things happen by chance.'). This is a model technique for making complex ideas accessible to a B1 audience. The text is well-structured and flows logically.",
