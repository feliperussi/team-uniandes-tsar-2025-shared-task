As part of this, we should look for ways to offer more flexible working hours and also consider how we can allow employees to work from the locations they choose. Managers need to find different ways to challenge their staff, and they should also give more positive feedback and show appreciation for the work that they do. Finally, spending more money on professional training could help create a positive atmosphere for employees so they can produce their best work, especially in the area of social and cultural communication.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is likely due to the use of advanced vocabulary. The original text's 'recognition' was replaced with 'appreciation', which is a C1-level word, making the text more complex. Additionally, the B2-level word 'flexible' was retained from the original text without simplification. To meet the B1 requirement, replace 'appreciation' with a simpler phrase like 'show they value the work'. For 'flexible', consider a phrase like 'working hours that can be changed'. The final sentence is also long and could be split to improve readability for a B1 audience.",

The output maintains perfect factual integrity and preserves the original meaning, as confirmed by the high MeaningBERT (0.909) and BERTScore (0.9461) metrics. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. A key strength of this submission is the structural simplification; breaking the final long sentence into two shorter, clearer sentences is a highly effective strategy for improving readability. The vocabulary choices are also very strong, for example, thoughtfully rephrasing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' into the more accessible 'positive feedback and show they value the work'. This is a high-quality submission that demonstrates a clear understanding of B1 simplification principles.",
