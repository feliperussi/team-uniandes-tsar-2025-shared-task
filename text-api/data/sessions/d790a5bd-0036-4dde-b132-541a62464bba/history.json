This is not such a big problem for my generation, because we lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone, and we also know that it is okay to be alone. But people who are under 20 are very different. They are so busy communicating through messages that they never experience being alone, and they might not learn how to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn to have conversations through messages which they can change, so they do not learn the skill of real conversation with a person in front of them.",

The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity. Qualitatively, the text exhibits strong B1 compliance. Complex vocabulary such as 'isolated', 'issue', 'danger', 'another kettle of fish', 'feeling of solitude', and 'at the expense of' were effectively simplified to 'alone', 'problem', 'risk', 'very different', 'being alone', and 'so they do not learn', respectively. The use of B1 connectors like 'because', 'and', 'also', 'but', and 'so' ensures a smooth and coherent flow. The sentence structure is clear and appropriate for the target level.
