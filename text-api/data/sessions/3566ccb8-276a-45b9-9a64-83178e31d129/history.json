Scientists found a gene that changed between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to have a connection with speaking. It is also linked to how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. However, their gene did not have this special change. It is too early to say how much genes affect language. But one day, the answers might be found in our DNA.",
