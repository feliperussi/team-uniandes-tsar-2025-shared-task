    "text_translated": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, there were two main ideas about dreams.\nOne idea said dreams show us secret things. These are things we do not know about. A man named Freud had this idea. He said our dreams tell us things. If we understand our dreams, we can understand our secret feelings. We can also understand our problems.\nBut the other idea was very different. It said dreams are just brain activity. This activity is not planned. The brain does this when it puts memories in order. These are memories from the day.\nWhen we wake up, we remember pictures and feelings. These pictures and feelings have no reason. We try to understand them. So we make a story about them.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. The two main theories about dreams are correctly represented.\n- Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.84 and BERTScore at 0.92 confirm that the core meaning and key terms were preserved effectively.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, indicating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful command of A2 constraints. Complex B1/B2 vocabulary such as 'represent', 'conscious', 'theory', 'random', and 'organising' has been systematically eliminated and replaced with simple A2 equivalents like 'show', 'secret', 'idea', 'not planned', and 'puts in order'. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only A2-appropriate connectors like 'but' and 'so'. The breakdown of complex sentences into multiple simple ones is executed flawlessly.",
