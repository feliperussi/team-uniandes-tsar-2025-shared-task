A man named Freud had this idea. He said our dreams tell us things. If we understand our dreams, we can understand our secret feelings. We can also understand our problems.\n\nBut the other idea was very different. It said dreams are just brain activity. This activity is not planned. The brain does this when it puts memories in order. These are memories from the day.\n\nWhen we wake up, we remember pictures and feelings. These pictures and feelings have no reason. We try to understand them. So we make a story about them.",

All metrics are well within acceptable parameters, with a MeaningBERT score of 0.84 and a BERTScore of 0.92. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. A full qualitative audit confirms strict adherence to all rules.\n\n- Vocabulary: The word choice is exclusively from the A1 and A2 levels. Complex concepts like 'represent things hidden from our conscious mind' were correctly simplified to 'show us secret things... we do not know about'.\n- Sentence Structure: The text successfully deconstructs complex sentences from the original into short, simple statements. The single complex sentence about Freud, for example, was correctly broken into four simple sentences.\n- Connectors: The use of simple connectors such as 'but', 'so', and 'when' is appropriate for the A2 level and maintains logical flow without introducing complexity.\n\nThe submission is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.",

MeaningBERT at 0.84 and BERTScore at 0.92 confirm that the core meaning and key terms were preserved effectively.\n- CEFR Classification: The text correctly classified as A2, indicating perfect alignment with the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful command of A2 constraints. Complex B1/B2 vocabulary such as 'represent', 'conscious', 'theory', 'random', and 'organising' has been systematically eliminated and replaced with simple A2 equivalents like 'show', 'secret', 'idea', 'not planned', and 'puts in order'. Sentence structures are short, direct, and use only A2-appropriate connectors like 'but' and 'so'. The breakdown of complex sentences into multiple simple ones is executed flawlessly.",
