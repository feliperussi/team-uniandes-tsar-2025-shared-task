    "text_translated": "**Asteroids** are large rocks that travel in space. NASA is now working to find smaller ones, especially those that are 140 metres wide or more. NASA thinks there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 of them so far. Therefore, 17,000 are still missing. These middle-sized asteroids will be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit. For example, a much smaller asteroid injured 1,200 people when it exploded over a city in Russia in 2013.",
