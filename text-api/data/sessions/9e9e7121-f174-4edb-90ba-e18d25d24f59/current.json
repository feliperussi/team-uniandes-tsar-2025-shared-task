    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification. It meets all diagnostic criteria without deviation. Factual Integrity: The output is factually identical to the original text. All numbers and core concepts are preserved. Metric Compliance: All metrics are well within the required thresholds. MeaningBERT at 0.77 and BERTScore at 0.91 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR Classifier correctly identifies the text as A2. Structural Simplicity: The text is correctly broken down into short, simple sentences. The use of connectors is limited to approved A2 words like 'so', 'and', 'but', and 'because'. Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. The key B1-level term 'contraception' was correctly identified and defined in simple A2 terms within the text itself, which is a perfect execution of the task.",
