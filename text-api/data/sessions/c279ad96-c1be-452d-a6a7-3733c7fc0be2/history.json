This is likely due to complex sentence structures that were not simplified from the original. For example, the question 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop?' uses a cleft sentence structure which is too advanced for B1. Additionally, the connector 'however' is more typical of B2 level writing. Suggestion: Rephrase the complex question to a simpler form, such as 'Did language cause their brains to develop?'. Also, replace 'however' with a more common B1 connector like 'but'. The vocabulary simplifications were appropriate, but the failure to simplify sentence structure is critical.",

The text lacks the use of B1-level grammatical structures like subordinate clauses or more complex connectors.
