    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The primary reason for failure is that the output was classified as 'A2' instead of the target 'B1'. While the simplification successfully preserved the original meaning and facts, with excellent MeaningBERT (0.93) and BERTScore (0.96) metrics, the resulting text was too simple. The combination of straightforward sentence structures, the replacement of terms like 'civilisation' with 'societies', and the addition of the very simple sentence 'It is not clear' likely contributed to the A2 classification. To meet the B1 requirement, consider introducing slightly more complex sentence structures. For example, the final two sentences could be combined: 'It remains unclear whether using language caused their brains to develop, or if their more complex brains started to produce language.' This would elevate the grammatical complexity to a B1 level without sacrificing clarity.",
