This may not seem like a lot, but this number shows two bigger problems for people and for nature. First, people often use credit cards to buy these clothes, and now British adults have to pay back about \u00a3670 each to credit card companies, which is 66% of the money they have for clothes. Also, people are spending money they don't have, and they are buying things they do not need. Because of this, Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothes every year, and most of these clothes go into landfill sites.",

The original text emphasizes 'two far more worrying trends for society and for the environment.' The simplified output, 'two bigger problems for people and for nature,' while conveying a similar idea, loses some of the urgency and the broader scope implied by 'worrying trends' and 'society/environment.' The original's 'not only... but also' structure also highlighted the dual nature of the problem (spending money they don't have AND buying things they don't need), which was softened by the 'and' conjunction in the simplified version. To improve, consider retaining stronger adjectives or more precise phrasing that captures the original's emphasis on the severity and nature of the issues. For example, instead of 'bigger problems,' perhaps 'serious problems' or 'troubling issues' could better convey the 'worrying' aspect. Also, ensure that the connection between the two issues (spending money they don't have and buying things they don't need) is as strong as in the original.",

That might not sound like much, but that figure hides two worrying problems for society and for the environment. First, a lot of that consumer spending is via credit cards. British people currently owe approximately \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66 per cent of the average wardrobe budget. Also, not only are people spending money they don't have, but they are also buying things they do not need.

Meaning preservation is excellent, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.9453, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original content is also outstanding, with a BERTScore of 0.9911, significantly exceeding the 0.90 requirement. Furthermore, the text accurately meets the target CEFR B1 level, as confirmed by the classifier. The simplification strategy was effective and subtle. The change from 'far more worrying trends' to 'worrying problems' is a good example of simplifying vocabulary while retaining the core message and reducing complexity. The slight rephrasing of 'they're using it to buy things they don't need' to 'but they are also buying things they do not need' also contributes to clarity and B1-appropriate sentence structure. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that achieves its goals with high precision.",
