    "text_translated": "In Britain, the average person spends more than \u00a31,000 on new clothes a year, which is around four per cent of their income. That might not sound like much, but that figure hides two worrying problems for society and for the environment. First, a lot of that consumer spending is via credit cards. British people currently owe approximately \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66 per cent of the average wardrobe budget. Also, not only are people spending money they don't have, but they are also buying things they do not need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing a year, most of which goes into landfill sites.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Meaning preservation is excellent, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.9453, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original content is also outstanding, with a BERTScore of 0.9911, significantly exceeding the 0.90 requirement. Furthermore, the text accurately meets the target CEFR B1 level, as confirmed by the classifier. The simplification strategy was effective and subtle. The change from 'far more worrying trends' to 'worrying problems' is a good example of simplifying vocabulary while retaining the core message and reducing complexity. The slight rephrasing of 'they're using it to buy things they don't need' to 'but they are also buying things they do not need' also contributes to clarity and B1-appropriate sentence structure. The text flows well and uses appropriate B1 connectors. Overall, this is a very strong simplification that achieves its goals with high precision.",
