    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6062 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Core Meaning Lost: The original text explicitly states the games are a form of 'punishment for rebelling'. Your version replaces this with 'The Capitol uses the games to remind the people of this' and 'show that the Capitol is in control'. This completely removes the central concept of punishment, which is a severe alteration of the source material's meaning.\n\n- Vocabulary: The B1 word 'remind' was retained from the original text. While used in a simpler sentence, its presence contributes to the overall drift from a pure A2 vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: The concept of 'punishment' must be restored. Rephrase the first paragraph to clearly state that the games happen because the Capitol is punishing the people for fighting in the past. For example: 'The games are a punishment because the people fought the Capitol in the past.'",
