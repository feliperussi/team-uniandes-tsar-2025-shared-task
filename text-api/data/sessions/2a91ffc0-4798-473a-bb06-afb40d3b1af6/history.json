The sentence 'The chosen teenagers are called tributes' only states the name; it does not explain it in simple A2 terms.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to include the concept of a 'reminder'.

Your version, 'The games help the Capitol show the districts they were wrong to fight in the past', fundamentally changes this meaning. It replaces the severe concept of 'punishment' with a much weaker idea of 'showing they were wrong'. This loss of meaning is unacceptable.\n\nWhile the BERTScore is adequate and the CEFR classifier is correct, the failure to preserve the central theme makes the text a failure.\n\nSuggestion: The concept of 'punishment' must be restored.

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Meaning Deviation: The original text establishes a direct causal link: the games are used 'to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling'. Your version breaks this link by stating disconnected facts: 'The games are a punishment for the districts... In the past, they fought the Capitol.' The crucial concept of the games as an active, annual 'reminder' is lost.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1-level word 'punishment' was used directly. This word is not on the A2-approved list and must be simplified. While you correctly explained 'districts', you failed to simplify 'punishment'.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The simplification process has damaged the logical connection between ideas, leading to the low meaning preservation score.\n\n- Suggestion: Restore the causal link using an A2-level connector. Rephrase 'The games are a punishment for the districts. In the past, they fought the Capitol.' to 'The games are a punishment because the districts fought the Capitol in the past.'\n\n- Suggestion: Replace the B1 word 'punishment'.
