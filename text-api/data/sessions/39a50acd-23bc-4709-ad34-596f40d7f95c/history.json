The simplification was factually correct and preserved the original meaning, but the linguistic complexity remains too high. The B2 classification is likely due to two main factors: 1. Complex Sentence Structure: The use of non-defining relative clauses (e.g., 'PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is a large international consulting firm...') is a structure more typical of the B2 level. 2. Advanced Vocabulary: The output includes the B2 word 'workplace' and the C1 word 'audit'. To meet the B1 requirement, revise the text by splitting the complex sentences into two simpler ones. For example: 'PricewaterhouseCoopers is a large international consulting firm. It carried out a global survey.' Additionally, replace 'workplace culture' with a simpler phrase like 'the culture at work' and simplify 'audit company' to 'a company that checks financial records' or remove 'audit' as it was an addition.",

The strategy of defining the keywords 'PricewaterhouseCoopers' and 'Deloitte' by integrating the phrase 'is a large international firm' directly into the text is an excellent method for providing context without a separate glossary. The use of shorter, simpler sentences makes the information much more accessible. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7499 is on the absolute minimum of the 'approximately 0.75' threshold, but is acceptable. This slight dip is likely due to necessary simplifications like changing 'participated in a study about their perceptions' to 'The survey asked millennials about', which is a reasonable trade-off for achieving B1 clarity.
