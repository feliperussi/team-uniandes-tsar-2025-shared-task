    "feedback": "This is an exemplary B1 simplification that passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained, with all numbers, names, and topics correctly transferred. The MeaningBERT (0.77) and BERTScore (0.93) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were preserved. The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. The simplification strategy is excellent. The writer effectively defined the keywords 'PricewaterhouseCoopers' and 'Deloitte' by describing them as 'a large international firm', providing necessary context for the reader. The original complex sentences were skillfully broken down into shorter, clearer sentences, improving readability. The use of the B1 connector 'Similarly' effectively links the two parts of the text, ensuring a smooth and logical flow. This output serves as a model for successful text simplification.",
