        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is below the required 'B1' target. While the output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning very well, the simplification was too aggressive. This is likely due to several factors: 1. Vocabulary replacement: The B2 phrase 'are keen to' was simplified to the A1 level 'want to', and the B2 concept 'raise awareness' was simplified to the more basic 'help people learn more'. 2. Sentence structure: The B1-level comparative structure starting with 'Unlike...' was rephrased into a simpler '...are different from... because...' structure. To meet the B1 requirement, consider reintroducing slightly more complex vocabulary, such as 'explain important environmental problems', or retaining the original 'Unlike...' sentence structure, which is appropriate for the target level.",

Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.95 and BERTScore of 0.99 are exceptionally high, confirming that the core message and key details were perfectly preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy was very conservative, with the only significant change being the removal of 'a range of'. This was an excellent decision. The original text was already very close to the B1 level, and the writer correctly identified that major changes were unnecessary. This demonstrates strong judgment by avoiding over-simplification, which maintained the natural flow and quality of the text while ensuring it met all requirements. The submission is of high quality.",
