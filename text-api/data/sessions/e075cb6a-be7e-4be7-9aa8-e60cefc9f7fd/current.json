Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world's highest mountains or walk across continents. Unlike the explorers of the past who used maps and compasses, today's adventurers travel with modern technology like GPS and satellite phones. Many adventurers are nature lovers who use their travels to help raise awareness about environmental issues, while others are keen to help people in need and raise money for charities.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The output successfully passes all stages of the diagnostic protocol. Factual Integrity: The text is 100% factually accurate compared to the original. Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.95 and BERTScore of 0.99 are exceptionally high, confirming that the core message and key details were perfectly preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieved the target B1 classification. Qualitative Analysis: The simplification strategy was very conservative, with the only significant change being the removal of 'a range of'. This was an excellent decision. The original text was already very close to the B1 level, and the writer correctly identified that major changes were unnecessary. This demonstrates strong judgment by avoiding over-simplification, which maintained the natural flow and quality of the text while ensuring it met all requirements. The submission is of high quality.",
