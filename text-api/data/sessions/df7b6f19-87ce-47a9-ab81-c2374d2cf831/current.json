    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all diagnostic checks with high marks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming that the core message and key details were successfully preserved. The output correctly achieved the target B1 CEFR level. The simplification strategy is excellent; the writer effectively broke down a complex sentence into three shorter, clearer sentences, which significantly improves readability. Vocabulary choices are superb, such as replacing 'inferior-quality' with 'low-quality' and 'defect' with 'problem', demonstrating a strong command of B1-level simplification.",
