Did some genes change and give us the power to speak? Scientists found a change in a gene. This change happened a long time ago. It happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This gene seems important for speaking. It helps our brain move our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene. But their gene did not change. We do not know now how important genes are for language. But one day we might find the answers in our DNA.",
