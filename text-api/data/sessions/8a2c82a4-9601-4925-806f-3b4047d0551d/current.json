    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7437 is below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a failure to fully preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text states 'two defence solutions could be launched'. Your version, 'NASA has two plans to stop it', is a simplification that loses the specific meaning of launching a defensive measure. 'Plans' are not the same as 'solutions' that can be 'launched'. This subtle inaccuracy is the cause of the metric failure.\n- Structural Compliance: The text correctly uses short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level.\n- Vocabulary Compliance: The vocabulary is strictly within the A2 level. The B2 word 'potentially' was correctly removed.\n- Factual Integrity: All numbers and core facts were maintained correctly.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentence to more accurately reflect the original meaning. Change 'NASA has two plans to stop it' to something like 'NASA can launch two things to defend Earth'.",
