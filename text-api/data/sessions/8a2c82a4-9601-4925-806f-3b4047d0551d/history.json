While simplification is required for A2, you cannot remove essential information.\n- Structural Compliance: The text uses appropriate A2 vocabulary and simple sentence structures.

The text also fails the fidelity check with a BERTScore of 0.8989, below the minimum of 0.90. The simplification has stripped the text of its core concepts.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.5843 indicates a severe deviation from the original message. The original text describes a scientific process of tracking, prediction, and defense. Your version reduces this to simply 'watching' and 'stopping' rocks, losing the critical concepts of prediction and organized defense solutions.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8989 reflects the replacement of key lexical items. The term 'Earth's orbit' is precise; your replacement 'Earth's path' is not an adequate A2 equivalent. The concept of 'predictions about possible impact' is entirely lost in your version 'see if a rock is going to hit Earth'.\n\n- Keyword Definition Failure: You were required to define the keyword 'Asteroids'. This was not done.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to preserve the original's core concepts. Restore the idea of 'prediction'. Rephrase to include the concept of 'orbit'. Define the keyword 'Asteroids' in simple A2 terms as instructed. The goal is simplification, not elimination of meaning.",

Your text reduces this to 'dangerous asteroids' and 'plans to stop it'. This is an unacceptable oversimplification that fails to convey the specific, scientific meaning of the source material.\n\n- Secondary Failure (Fidelity): The BERTScore of 0.8974 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is a direct result of removing key factual terms like 'orbit', 'threat', and 'impact'.\n\n- Tertiary Failure (CEFR Compliance): The text was classified as B1, not the required A2. The use of the B1 vocabulary word 'within' is a clear violation. The sentence 'They can say if an asteroid is going to hit Earth...' uses an indirect question, a B1 grammatical structure.\n\n- Suggestion: You must restore the core meaning. Rephrase 'dangerous' to 'could be dangerous' to reflect the 'potential' nature. Replace the B1 word 'within' with an A2 alternative like 'less than'. Break down the B1 sentence structure.
