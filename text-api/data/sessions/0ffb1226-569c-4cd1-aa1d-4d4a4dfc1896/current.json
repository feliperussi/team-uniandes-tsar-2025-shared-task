    "text_translated": "It is helpful to know that people have different expectations and behaviour. This can help us avoid problems when we communicate. However, we must remember something important. Cultural stereotypes can be bad for business relationships. Stereotypes are simple but often untrue ideas about what a group of people is like.\n\nNational culture can affect how we behave and think. But many other things also influence us. For example, our region, community, age, and gender are important. Our company's culture and personal experiences also affect us. So, we should remember these possible differences. But we should not use this knowledge to judge all people from a nation.",
