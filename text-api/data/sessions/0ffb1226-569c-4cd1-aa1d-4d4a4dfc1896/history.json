The sentence 'However, it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes can be bad for building good business relationships' is 20 words long. The sentence 'These include the region we come from, the communities we are part of, our age and gender, and our company's culture' is 22 words long. Sentences must not exceed approximately 15 words to maintain B1 readability. The long list in the second paragraph makes the sentence too complex."
