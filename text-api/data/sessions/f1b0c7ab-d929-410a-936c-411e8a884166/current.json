The BERTScore (0.94) and MeaningBERT (0.90) exceed the required thresholds, and the classifier confirms a B1 level. The text is fluent, uses the connector \u201cbut\u201d and \u201cso\u201d correctly, and maintains key vocabulary such as \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201cstructures.\u201d To enhance nuance, you could reintroduce \u201crelatively\u201d (for example, \u201cmodern bridges do not fall down very often, relatively speaking\u201d) to mirror the original emphasis on infrequency. You might also vary sentence openings (for instance, start with \u201cModern bridges\u201d rather than linking directly with \u201cbut\u201d) to improve stylistic variety.",
