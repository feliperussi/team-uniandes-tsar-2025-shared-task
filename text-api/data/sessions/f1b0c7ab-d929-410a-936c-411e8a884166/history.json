The original text states \"Earthquakes damage all structures, including bridges,\" but the output incorrectly states \"Earthquakes can damage many structures, including bridges,\" which changes the scope from \"all\" to \"many.\" This quantifier shift alters the original claim. To correct this, preserve the original scope by keeping \"all structures\" or use an equivalent phrase such as \"all kinds of structures.\"",

The text is fluent, uses the connector \u201cbut\u201d and \u201cso\u201d correctly, and maintains key vocabulary such as \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201cstructures.\u201d To enhance nuance, you could reintroduce \u201crelatively\u201d (for example, \u201cmodern bridges do not fall down very often, relatively speaking\u201d) to mirror the original emphasis on infrequency. You might also vary sentence openings (for instance, start with \u201cModern bridges\u201d rather than linking directly with \u201cbut\u201d) to improve stylistic variety.",
