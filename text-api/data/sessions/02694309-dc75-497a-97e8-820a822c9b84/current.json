    "text_translated": "Sometimes bridges fall down and people do not know why. Engineers study the problem to understand the reason. Sometimes, this happens because they built the bridge with bad material. Or it happens because there was a problem with an important part of the bridge. In other cases, they built the bridge to hold a certain weight. It could not hold more weight than that.",

    "feedback": "The text is a perfect example of A2 simplification. It successfully avoids the passive voice ('was used', 'was designed') by using the active 'they built'. Vocabulary choices like 'bad material' for 'inferior-quality material' and 'a problem with an important part' for 'a defect in a key piece' are excellent. The sentence structure is simple and clear. No errors found.",
