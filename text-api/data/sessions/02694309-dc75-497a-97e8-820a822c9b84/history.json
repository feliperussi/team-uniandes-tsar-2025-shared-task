        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text violates the 'No Excuses' vocabulary rule. The word 'specific' is B1 level. The A2 alternative 'certain' from the original text should have been used. While the simplification of complex terms like 'investigation', 'defect', and 'inferior-quality' is commendable, a single violation of the core vocabulary rule results in an automatic failure. Adherence must be absolute."

        "feedback_text": "The text is a perfect example of A2 simplification. It successfully avoids the passive voice ('was used', 'was designed') by using the active 'they built'. Vocabulary choices like 'bad material' for 'inferior-quality material' and 'a problem with an important part' for 'a defect in a key piece' are excellent. The sentence structure is simple and clear. No errors found."
