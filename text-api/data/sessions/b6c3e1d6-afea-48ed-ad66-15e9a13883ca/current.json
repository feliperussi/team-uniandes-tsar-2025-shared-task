    "text_translated": "Asteroids are large rocks that fly in space. NASA is now working to find and record information about smaller asteroids. These are asteroids that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size. But they have only found about 8,000 so far. So, 17,000 of them are still missing. This is a serious problem because even a small asteroid can be dangerous. For example, an asteroid exploded over a city in Russia in 2013. It was only 19 metres wide and it injured 1,200 people. Therefore, these bigger asteroids would be a very serious danger if they come near Earth.",
