        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7199 is below the required 0.75. This indicates a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuance. While the individual facts are present, the emphasis on the 'remarkably successful adaptation' of the dogs to urban life is diluted. The original text conveys a stronger sense of their unique and impressive adaptation, which is weakened by phrases like 'learned to live very well' in the simplified version. The choppy sentence structure also fragments the narrative, reducing the overall coherence and impact of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to better convey the degree of success and adaptation, ensuring the core message of the dogs' remarkable urban survival is fully preserved.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.7918 and BERTScore of 0.9297 are well within the acceptable range. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. Vocabulary is consistently at the A1/A2 level, with no detected B1 or higher words. Sentence structures are short and simple, avoiding complex clauses or advanced connectors. The simplification of 'adapted remarkably successfully to urban life' to 'learned to live in the city very well. This was a big success.' is an excellent example of A2-level rephrasing.",
