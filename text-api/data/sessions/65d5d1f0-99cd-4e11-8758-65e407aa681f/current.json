    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all A2 readability requirements. It maintains factual integrity, preserves the core meaning, and adheres to the specified CEFR level. The MeaningBERT score of 0.7918 and BERTScore of 0.9297 are well within the acceptable range. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. Vocabulary is consistently at the A1/A2 level, with no detected B1 or higher words. Sentence structures are short and simple, avoiding complex clauses or advanced connectors. The simplification of 'adapted remarkably successfully to urban life' to 'learned to live in the city very well. This was a big success.' is an excellent example of A2-level rephrasing.",
