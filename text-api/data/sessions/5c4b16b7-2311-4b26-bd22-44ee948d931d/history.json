The BERTScore of 0.8999 is also below the 0.90 threshold, indicating a loss of key phrasing. Additionally, the text fails the vocabulary audit. The word 'rider' is B1 level and is not permitted. The sentence structure is appropriately simple for A2, but this does not excuse the critical failure to preserve the original meaning.\n\nCorrection Mandate:\n- Rephrase to restore the comparative meaning. The concept of 'even more trouble' must be clearly communicated.\n- Replace the B1 word 'rider'. Use an A2 phrase such as 'a person who can ride a horse'.\n- The simplification was too aggressive, resulting in a loss of the core message.

The core comparative and speculative meaning of the original text has been lost.\n\n- The primary reason for the low MeaningBERT score is the failure to preserve the original text's comparison. The original contrasts the trouble a good rider could cause with the even greater trouble a non-rider could cause. Your version presents these as two separate, disconnected facts, which destroys the central point of the paragraph.\n\n- The simplification of the B1 word 'rebellious' to the A2 word 'angry' is a factual alteration. 'Rebellious' describes a character trait; 'angry' describes a temporary emotion. This change contributes to the loss of meaning.\n\n- The text is over-simplified into a list of short, choppy sentences. This fragmentation breaks the logical links present in the original text. For example, the final three sentences fail to connect the boy's lack of skill with his desire to escape his father, a key idea in the source.\n\n- Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the central comparison. Use a structure like: 'A boy who can ride well can make trouble. But a boy who cannot ride can make even more trouble if he wants to run away.'\n\n- Suggestion: Combine related sentences to restore logical flow. The final three sentences must be rewritten to show the cause-and-effect relationship.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message and tone of the original text.\n\n- Core Meaning Lost: The original text builds a mood of tension, isolation, and speculation about potential trouble. Your output reduces this to a series of disconnected, simple facts, losing the entire underlying feeling. The text is no longer about the psychological weight of the place; it is just a description.\n- Narrative Inaccuracy: You wrote 'Sam thought about a teenage boy.' before describing the boy's potential boredom. The original text presents this as a general observation by the narrator first, and only later focuses on Sam's specific thoughts. This is a factual change in the narrative perspective.\n- Oversimplification Damage: While sentence simplification is necessary for A2, your approach was too aggressive. Breaking every idea into its own short sentence made the text choppy and destroyed the logical connections between concepts, which is why the meaning score is so low. For example, the original's complex thought 'But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father' is broken into two sentences that weaken the cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning of tension and inescapable trouble. The goal is simplification, not sterilization. Recombine some sentences to show how ideas are connected. Correct the narrative error; the general thought about a rebellious boy is not Sam's thought.",
