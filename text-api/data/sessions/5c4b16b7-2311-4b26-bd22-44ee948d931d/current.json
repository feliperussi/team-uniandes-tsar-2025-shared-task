    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6313 is significantly below the required 0.75. The original text contrasts two levels of 'trouble' - one for a skilled rider and a greater one for an unskilled one. Your version's phrasing 'get into trouble' versus 'a bigger problem' does not capture this specific contrast, losing the core message of escalating danger.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'rider' was used. This is not A2 vocabulary.\n- Structural Weakness: The final two sentences are disconnected. The phrase 'This was true if...' is an awkward and overly complex construction for A2.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core meaning by directly comparing the two problems. Replace 'rider' with an A2 phrase like 'a person who can ride a horse'. Combine the final two ideas into one simple sentence using 'if'.",
