    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2', which is too simple and falls below the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to oversimplification of vocabulary and sentence structure. For example, the phrase 'evidence of early human civilisation' was simplified to 'how people lived together', which significantly reduces the conceptual complexity from a B1/B2 level to an A1/A2 level. Additionally, the original text's first complex sentence, which included a semicolon, was split into three much shorter, simpler sentences in the output. The replacement of 'yet' with 'But' and 'caused' with 'make' also contributes to the lower CEFR classification. To achieve a B1 level, the text should retain more of the original conceptual vocabulary, such as 'civilisation', and employ a slightly more varied sentence structure, perhaps by using B1-level connectors (e.g., 'however', 'although') or by not splitting sentences as aggressively.",
