The text fails due to the use of a word that is above the A2 CEFR level.\n\n- B2 Vocabulary Detected: The word 'electronics' is classified as B2 level. A2 texts must strictly adhere to A1 and A2 vocabulary. The original text's 'electrical goods' was replaced with an equally complex term.\n\n- Structural Compliance: The text successfully uses short, simple sentences appropriate for the A2 level. The breakdown of complex ideas into individual sentences is correct.\n\n- Metrics: The text passes the quantitative checks. MeaningBERT (0.85) and BERTScore (0.91) are above the required thresholds, and the CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. However, the qualitative audit reveals the vocabulary failure.\n\nSuggestion: Replace 'electronics' with a simpler A2 description. Use a phrase like 'things that use electricity' or provide simple examples such as 'TVs and phones'.",
