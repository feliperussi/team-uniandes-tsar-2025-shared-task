        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'A2' instead of the target 'B1', indicating oversimplification. While the output is factually correct and preserves the original meaning well, its vocabulary and sentence structures are too simple for the B1 level. The original text's B1-level phrasing, such as 'realises his only option is to' and 'has no immediate interest', was replaced with simpler A2 structures like 'climbs back... because' and 'does not want to... right away'. To reach the B1 target, consider reintroducing slightly more complex sentence construction. For example, 'However, he quickly climbs back into the lifeboat because he remembers there are hungry sharks in the water' could be revised to 'After remembering the hungry sharks in the water, he decides his only option is to climb back into the boat.'",

Factual integrity, meaning, and fidelity are perfectly preserved, as confirmed by high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.98) values. The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategy was excellent. Instead of replacing vocabulary, the writer improved the text's flow and cohesion by introducing appropriate B1-level structures. For example, changing 'Pi is terrified... and jumps' to 'Pi is so terrified that he jumps' creates a more sophisticated cause-and-effect sentence. Similarly, using the connector 'However' and the clause 'after remembering' effectively links the ideas between sentences. This is a model example of enhancing readability for a B1 audience without losing the original's detail or tone.",
