    "feedback": "PASS: The submission successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity, meaning, and fidelity are perfectly preserved, as confirmed by high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.98) values. The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategy was excellent. Instead of replacing vocabulary, the writer improved the text's flow and cohesion by introducing appropriate B1-level structures. For example, changing 'Pi is terrified... and jumps' to 'Pi is so terrified that he jumps' creates a more sophisticated cause-and-effect sentence. Similarly, using the connector 'However' and the clause 'after remembering' effectively links the ideas between sentences. This is a model example of enhancing readability for a B1 audience without losing the original's detail or tone.",
