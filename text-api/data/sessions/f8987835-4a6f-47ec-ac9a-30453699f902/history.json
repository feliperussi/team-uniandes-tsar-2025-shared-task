The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.8888 falling short of the 0.90 minimum. The attempt to simplify has destroyed the core meaning of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure: The simplification of the B1-level word 'spark' to 'small hot light' is a complete meaning failure. While 'small hot light' uses A1/A2 words, it does not accurately describe a spark and is the main reason for the low MeaningBERT score.\n- Secondary Failure: The causal link is broken. The original text directly connects the spark's creation by the wheels to the fire. Your version splits this into two weak sentences: 'Steel wheels on steel tracks sometimes made a small hot light. That light could start a fire.' This severs the direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n- Structural Note: While the sentence structure and vocabulary choices are compliant with the A2 level, this was achieved by sacrificing critical information, resulting in an unacceptable loss of meaning.\n\nSuggestion: You must preserve the concept of a 'spark'. Rephrase to define the term. Example: 'The steel wheels on the steel tracks sometimes made a spark. A spark is a tiny piece of fire.' This preserves the key term while explaining it in A2 language. Combine sentences to restore the direct causal link. Example: 'This spark could fall on the wood and start a fire.'",

This indicates a severe failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The BERTScore of 0.8896 also fails the minimum fidelity requirement of 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text uses the phrase 'much more susceptible to fire' to convey a high degree of risk. Your version, 'could catch fire easily', significantly weakens this concept. The core idea of inherent vulnerability is lost.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The original's phrase 'burn to the ground' implies complete and total destruction. Your replacement, 'burn the whole bridge', is lexically simpler but fails to capture the same degree of finality, contributing to the low BERTScore.\n\n- Structural Damage: While using short sentences is an A2 strategy, you have fragmented the text to the point of damaging the causal link. The original clearly states the spark was 'created by' the wheels. Your version separates these ideas into multiple sentences, which contributed to the collapse of the MeaningBERT score.\n\n- Suggestion: You must rephrase to restore the original meaning. The concepts of high risk and total destruction must be present. Combine sentences to re-establish the direct cause-and-effect relationship between the train wheels and the fire.",
