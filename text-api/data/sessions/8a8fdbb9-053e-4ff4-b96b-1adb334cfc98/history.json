This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text frames the topic as a personal realization ('If we look around us... we would no doubt notice...'). Your version ('Many things we own are not used very much.') removes this framing entirely, turning a reflective observation into a flat, impersonal statement. This is a severe loss of meaning.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8582 is below the required 0.90. This is a direct result of oversimplification. Key descriptive words like 'purchased', 'trendy', 'tropical', and 'storeroom' were replaced with less precise A2 alternatives, causing a loss of factual detail.\n\n- Structural Repetition: The structure is excessively simplistic and repetitive. The phrase 'Another example is' is used three times consecutively. This is unnatural and demonstrates a failure to use basic A2-level connectors to link ideas.\n\n- Vocabulary Error: The analysis incorrectly flags 'used' as B1. While the passive form can be complex, 'used' is a core A2 verb. This is a minor point compared to the catastrophic metric failures.\n\nSuggestion: You must reintroduce the core idea of personal observation. Start with a sentence like 'If you look at your things, you may see you do not use them all.' Combine the repetitive 'example' sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or by creating slightly longer, compound sentences. Restore more precise meaning; for instance, change 'a room for things' to 'a room where we keep old things' to better reflect the meaning of 'storeroom'.",

A2 level requires simpler, active constructions.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core message of 'noticing' or 'seeing' that things are unused at the beginning. Combine the fragmented sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'but' to show how ideas are related. Replace the B1 passive 'are not used' with an active A2 phrase like 'you do not use'.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The original text's central idea is that we own things that are not 'put to good use'. Your version simplifies this to 'we do not use them well'. This simplification loses the original's nuance of wastefulness and poor purchasing decisions, which is a significant deviation in meaning.\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8912 is below the 0.90 minimum. This reflects the loss of key lexical items from the original, such as 'purchased' and 'put to good use', which were replaced with less precise A2 alternatives.\n- Structural Issue: The original text is a single, complex sentence that conveys a single, reflective thought. Your output breaks this into a series of short, disconnected statements. This excessive simplification makes the text choppy and contributes to the loss of the original's tone and meaning.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten. Focus on restoring the core concept of 'not being used for their intended purpose' or 'being a wasteful purchase'. You must achieve this without creating complex sentences. Combine some of the shorter sentences to improve the logical flow. For example, instead of 'We may keep an old phone after we buy a new one. We use the old phone little,' try 'After we buy a new phone, we keep the old one but we do not use it much.'",

The original text presents a reflection on ownership, but your version reframes it as 'we see a problem', which alters the core message and tone.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text was classified as B1, not A2. This is an instant failure. The reason is the repeated use of B1 grammatical structures.\n- Structural Violation: The text uses multiple relative clauses, which are a B1-level structure. Examples include 'things that are not used', 'a car that we drive', and 'a guest room that we turn'.\n- Structural Violation: The first sentence, 'If we look at what we own...', uses a 'what-clause', which is a B1 structure.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The vocabulary analysis identifies 'used' as a B1 word. This is not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Eliminate all relative clauses and what-clauses. Split complex sentences into simple, short A2 sentences. Example: 'We may have a car.

The text fails on two critical metrics, indicating a severe deviation from the source's intent.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.6476 is significantly below the required 0.75. Your version reduces a reflective observation into a simple, disconnected list. The original's core idea about consumer habits is lost in this fragmentation.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8471 is below the 0.90 threshold. Key phrases from the original text, such as 'purchased at some point in our lives' and 'despite the fact that', were eliminated entirely. This results in an unacceptable loss of lexical detail and context.\n\n- Structural Fragmentation: The original complex sentence was broken into 14 extremely short, choppy sentences. This over-simplification makes the text sound unnatural and disjointed, which is the primary cause of the low meaning score.\n\nSuggestion: Do not fragment the text this severely. Combine sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and', 'but', and 'because' to restore the logical flow. The goal is simplification, not the complete deconstruction of the original's logic. For example: 'We may have a thick wool coat, but we do not wear it because we live in a hot country.' This restores the relationship between the ideas.",
