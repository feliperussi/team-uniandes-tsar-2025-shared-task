    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The original text states the wool coat is unused because 'we live in a tropical country'. Your version incorrectly states 'it is not good', which changes the core reason for the item's disuse.\n\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: This factual error is confirmed by the metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6412 is critically below the required 0.75, indicating a severe loss of the original message.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8637 is below the 0.90 threshold. This shows a failure to retain key factual phrasing from the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text uses the word 'despite', which is B1 level and not compliant with the A2 standard.\n\n- Structural Violation: The phrase 'despite the fact that' is a B1-level complex clause. A2 texts must use simpler connectors.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the sentence about the coat to state the correct reason: 'we live in a hot country'. Remove the B1 phrase 'despite the fact that'. Use a simple A2 connector like 'but'.",
