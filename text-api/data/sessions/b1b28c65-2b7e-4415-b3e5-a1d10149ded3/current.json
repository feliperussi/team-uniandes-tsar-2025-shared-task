    "feedback": "Your output preserves all original facts and key relationships and meets the CEFR B1 requirement. The meaning is clear, and technical vocabulary has been simplified appropriately. To enhance cohesion and sentence variety, introduce more linking words such as although, however, or but rather than relying on only short sentences. For example, you could combine \u201cNational cultures can shape how we act and think\u201d with the previous idea using \u201cAlthough national cultures can shape how we act and think, we are also influenced by our region, our company culture and our own experiences.\u201d Finally, consider adding a brief definition or example of \u201ccultural stereotypes\u201d to ensure full comprehension for B1 readers. These changes will improve flow and reader engagement while keeping the language accessible.",
