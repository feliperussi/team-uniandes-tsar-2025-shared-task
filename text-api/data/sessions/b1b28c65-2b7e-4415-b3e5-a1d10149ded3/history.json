For example, the opening sentence \u2018\u2018Being more aware of possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid miscommunication, but we must also remember that cultural stereotypes can harm good business relationships\u2019\u2019 uses a gerund clause and lengthy phrasing that exceed B1. To address this, simplify the structure by starting with a conditional or a subject\u2013verb construction: \u201cIf we are more aware of possible differences in expectations and behaviour, we can avoid miscommunication.\u201d Also consider shortening sentences and avoiding advanced forms like \u2018being\u2019 at the beginning. These changes will help ensure the text fits the B1 level.",

        "feedback_text": "Your output preserves all original facts and key relationships and meets the CEFR B1 requirement. The meaning is clear, and technical vocabulary has been simplified appropriately. To enhance cohesion and sentence variety, introduce more linking words such as although, however, or but rather than relying on only short sentences. For example, you could combine \u201cNational cultures can shape how we act and think\u201d with the previous idea using \u201cAlthough national cultures can shape how we act and think, we are also influenced by our region, our company culture and our own experiences.\u201d Finally, consider adding a brief definition or example of \u201ccultural stereotypes\u201d to ensure full comprehension for B1 readers.
