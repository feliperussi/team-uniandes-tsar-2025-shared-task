The MeaningBERT score of 0.7905 indicates excellent preservation of the core message. The BERTScore of 0.9015 confirms high lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary used is consistently at an A1/A2 level, and the keywords 'engineers' and 'miscalculation' are effectively defined using simple language. Sentence structures are short and direct, employing A2-appropriate connectors such as 'when' and 'because'. No factual inaccuracies or linguistic deviations from the A2 standard were found.",
