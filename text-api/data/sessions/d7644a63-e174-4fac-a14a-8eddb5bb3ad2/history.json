While the facts are present, the core message of the speaker's frustration and the inherent problem of doing five days of work for three days' pay is significantly diluted. The original text conveys a clear sense of an unfair situation with phrases like 'workload hasn't decreased in the slightest!' and the overall tone. Your version states the facts but loses the critical nuance of the problem and the speaker's implied complaint. The emotional and problematic aspect of the original message is not fully preserved.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6685 is below the required 0.75, indicating a significant loss of the original text's core message and nuance. While the BERTScore of 0.9009 is acceptable for lexical fidelity, the deeper meaning has been diluted. Specific deviations are as follows: 1. The specific context of 'parental leave' is lost. The phrase 'I had time off for my children' is too general and does not convey the formal, structured nature of the original's absence from work, which is crucial to the narrative's setup. 2. The strong emphasis of 'workload hasn't decreased in the slightest!' is weakened to 'my work did not get less'. The original conveys a complete lack of reduction and a sense of exasperation, which is not fully captured. 3. The original's use of 'significant cut in my pay' is softened to 'my pay is much smaller'. While conveying the reduction, 'significant' adds an important layer of impact. 4. The subtle but important contextual cues provided by connectors like 'of course' and 'though' are entirely removed. These words convey expectation and contrast, which are part of the original's meaning. 5. The addition of subjective interpretations such as 'This is a problem' and 'This is not fair' deviates from the original's more descriptive and observational tone. The task is to simplify, not to introduce new emotional statements or explicit judgments. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific context of 'parental leave'. Strengthen the language to reflect the complete lack of workload reduction. Reintroduce the nuance of 'significant' for the pay cut. Avoid adding explicit subjective judgments not present in the original.",

The MeaningBERT score of 0.759 and BERTScore of 0.9112 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A1/A2 range, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate terms like 'Then', 'After that', 'Of course', and 'But'. The simplification of 'parental leave' to 'leave for my children' and 'pro-rata basis' to 'I get money only for the days I work' demonstrates effective A2 adaptation without loss of core information.",
