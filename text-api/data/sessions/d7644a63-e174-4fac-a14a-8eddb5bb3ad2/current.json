    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT score of 0.759 and BERTScore of 0.9112 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A1/A2 range, with no complex words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, and connectors are limited to A2-appropriate terms like 'Then', 'After that', 'Of course', and 'But'. The simplification of 'parental leave' to 'leave for my children' and 'pro-rata basis' to 'I get money only for the days I work' demonstrates effective A2 adaptation without loss of core information.",
