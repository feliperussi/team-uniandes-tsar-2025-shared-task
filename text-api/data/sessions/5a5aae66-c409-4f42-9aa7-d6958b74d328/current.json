    "feedback": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is too complex for the target 'B1' level. The writer's output is almost identical to the original text, indicating that insufficient simplification was performed. For example, the first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we started to see evidence of early human civilisation, for example, through cave paintings; no one knows the connection between this and language,' is long and uses a semicolon, which is typically B2. The rhetorical questions at the end, 'Was it the use of language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?' also contribute to a higher complexity level. To achieve B1, sentences should be shorter and simpler, and complex structures like semicolons or rhetorical questions should be rephrased. For instance, the first sentence could be split into two, and the questions could be rephrased as statements or simpler questions.",
