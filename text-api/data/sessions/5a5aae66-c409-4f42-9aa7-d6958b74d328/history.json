While the factual integrity and meaning preservation are excellent (MeaningBERT: 0.8568, BERTScore: 0.9665), the simplification strategy has resulted in an output that is below the required complexity. The primary reason for the A2 classification is the oversimplification of sentence structure. For example, the original sentence 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation, through cave paintings for example; no one knows the connection between this and language.' was broken into three much shorter, simpler sentences: 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see signs of early human civilisation. For example, there were cave paintings. However, no one knows how this is connected to language.' Similarly, 'Brains didn't suddenly get bigger, yet humans did become more complex and more intelligent.' was split into 'Brains did not suddenly get bigger. But humans became more complex and intelligent.' This consistent breaking down of compound or complex sentences into multiple simple sentences, along with some vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'evidence' to 'signs', 'producing' to 'make'), reduces the overall grammatical complexity and sentence length to an A2 level. To achieve B1, consider retaining some compound sentences using B1-level conjunctions (e.g., 'although', 'while', 'whereas') or slightly more varied sentence structures, rather than always splitting them into separate simple sentences. The vocabulary choices were generally appropriate, but the structural simplification was too aggressive.",

The simplification effort was minimal, resulting in a text that retains much of the original's complexity. Specifically, the long, compound question 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop, or did their more complex brains start producing language?' is structurally advanced for a B1 learner. Additionally, the word 'civilisation' is typically considered a B2 vocabulary item. To achieve B1, consider splitting the complex question into two simpler, direct questions and replacing 'civilisation' with a more accessible term like 'human society' or 'ways of living'.",

While the simplification successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT 0.8999, BERTScore 0.9789), the linguistic complexity of the output is too low for a B1 target. The text primarily uses simple sentence structures and a high proportion of A1/A2 vocabulary. For instance, the original's 'Was it using language that caused their brains to develop?' was simplified to 'Did using language make their brains develop?', which is a grammatically simpler construction. Additionally, 'civilisation' was simplified to 'society', contributing to lower lexical complexity. To achieve a B1 level, the text needs to incorporate a slightly more varied range of sentence structures, including some subordinate clauses, and a higher density of B1-level vocabulary, while still maintaining clarity. For example, instead of 'Did using language make their brains develop?', a B1 alternative could be 'Did the use of language lead to their brains developing?' or 'Was it the use of language that caused their brains to develop?' to introduce slightly more complex phrasing without becoming overly difficult.",

For example, the first sentence, 'Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we started to see evidence of early human civilisation, for example, through cave paintings; no one knows the connection between this and language,' is long and uses a semicolon, which is typically B2. The rhetorical questions at the end, 'Was it the use of language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to produce language?' also contribute to a higher complexity level.
