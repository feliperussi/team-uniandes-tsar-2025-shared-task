The core message regarding the Capitol's specific intent and the nature of the games as a 'reminder' of punishment has been lost due to excessive fragmentation and simplification. The original text states 'which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling.' Your version breaks this into multiple, disconnected sentences: 'The Capitol is a place. The Capitol uses these games. They want to show the other areas. The areas get punished. This is because they fought against the Capitol.' This fragmentation dilutes the direct, instrumental purpose of the games as a tool for psychological control and a constant reminder. The output describes the punishment but fails to convey that the games themselves are the mechanism of 'reminding'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the first paragraph to clearly link the Hunger Games directly to the Capitol's purpose of reminding the districts of their punishment.

The extensive fragmentation of the original's more complex sentences into many simple ones, combined with the simplification of specific terms, diluted the semantic density and nuance of the core message. For instance, the original's concise explanation of the Hunger Games as an 'annual event, which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling' was broken into six separate sentences in your output, losing some of the direct causal link and overall coherence in the semantic representation. This reduction in semantic density is unacceptable for the A2 standard. Additionally, a vocabulary deviation was detected. The word 'punishment' is classified as B1. For A2 compliance, simpler phrasing such as 'they get bad things' or 'they are made to suffer' should be used, or the verb form 'punish' could be considered if it fits the sentence structure and is confirmed A2. Suggestion: Rephrase the initial sentences to maintain a slightly higher semantic density while remaining within A2 sentence structures. Ensure all vocabulary is strictly A2. Consider using the A2 verb 'punish' if possible, or a simpler phrase for the noun 'punishment'.",

It dilutes the direct, authoritative act of punishment. The original conveys a clear consequence imposed by a ruling power. The phrase 'Everyone in the country must watch the game on TV' weakens the original 'The whole nation is forced to watch the event on television'.
