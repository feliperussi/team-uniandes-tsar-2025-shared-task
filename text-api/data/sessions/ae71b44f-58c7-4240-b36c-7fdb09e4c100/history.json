      "content": "Text saved: The Life of Pi tells the unusual story of Pi, a teenage boy from India, who has a shipwreck, which means a ship is badly damaged at sea. He finds himself alone in a lifeboat, a small boat used for saving people after a shipwreck, in the Pacific Ocean. Pi shares the lifeboat with a fierce tiger, which is a large wild animal with sharp teeth and claws. This story is from the third book by the Canadian author, which means a person who writes books, Yann Martel, and it was published in 2001. Since then, it has sold more than seven million copies all over the world and has won many prizes. The book has also been translated into 41 different languages. Martel is the son of a diplomat, a person who represents their country in another country, and as a child, he lived in Costa Rica, Canada, France, and Mexico.",

        "feedback_text": "The Writer's Output accurately preserves all factual details from the Original Text, including names, dates, numbers, and relationships, passing the crucial Factual Integrity check. Both MeaningBERT (0.7796) and BERTScore (0.9336) exceed the required thresholds, ensuring the core meaning and key lexical items are well maintained. The CEFR_Classifier_Result is correctly identified as B1, matching the target simplification level. The text uses clear, explanatory phrases to define the keywords like 'shipwreck,' 'lifeboat,' 'tiger,' 'author,' and 'diplomat,' which supports comprehension for B1 learners without oversimplifying. Sentence structures are varied and mostly fluent, with helpful embedded definitions that do not disrupt flow. However, some definitional phrases, like 'which means a ship is badly damaged at sea,' increase sentence length and complexity slightly; consider breaking these into shorter sentences to improve readability and fluency for B1 level. Overall, the vocabulary strategy is consistent, correctly applying A1 to B1 level words and definitions while avoiding more complex C1 words. For future improvement, strive to enhance cohesion by linking explanatory sentences with simple connectors such as 'so' or 'because' to improve text flow. This output meets all critical requirements and is a solid B1-level simplification.",
