        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent B1 text. The structure is clear and demonstrates strong competence by using a mix of simple and complex sentences. The use of connectors like 'which' to define a key term ('...genes, which are parts of our DNA...') and 'Although' to contrast ideas is a sign of high B1 proficiency. The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the level, and all facts from the original text are accurately preserved."
