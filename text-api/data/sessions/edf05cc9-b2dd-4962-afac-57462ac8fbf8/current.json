    "text_translated": "Researchers are asking if special **genes**, which are parts of our DNA that control how we grow, gave people the ability to speak. They have found a change in a gene that happened between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. This change seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Although monkeys have a similar gene, it did not have this same change. It is still too early to say how much genes affect language, but the answers might one day be found in our DNA.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent B1 text. The structure is clear and demonstrates strong competence by using a mix of simple and complex sentences. The use of connectors like 'which' to define a key term ('...genes, which are parts of our DNA...') and 'Although' to contrast ideas is a sign of high B1 proficiency. The vocabulary is perfectly suited for the level, and all facts from the original text are accurately preserved.",
