    "text_translated": "Asteroids are rocks that fly through space. Some of them are called 'Potentially Hazardous Asteroids'. These rocks can pass close to Earth's path around the sun. They can come within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. NASA has made a map of 1,400 of these asteroids. None of them are a danger for the next 100 years. With the technology we have now, NASA can follow these objects. They can also predict a possible hit. If this happens, we could use two different solutions to protect Earth.",

    "feedback": "PASS. The text is a flawless B1 adaptation. It correctly defines the keyword 'Asteroids'. Sentences are short and clear. Complex vocabulary from the original text ('orbit', 'track', 'impact') has been successfully replaced with simpler B1 alternatives ('path around the sun', 'follow', 'hit'). The text is factually accurate. No corrections are needed.",
