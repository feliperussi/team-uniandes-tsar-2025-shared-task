This exceeds the maximum length of ~15 words and must be simplified. The sentence 'They do not expect any of them to be a danger in the next one hundred years' is also too long at 17 words. Sentences must be shorter for B1 readability."

Complex vocabulary from the original text ('orbit', 'track', 'impact') has been successfully replaced with simpler B1 alternatives ('path around the sun', 'follow', 'hit'). The text is factually accurate. No corrections are needed."
