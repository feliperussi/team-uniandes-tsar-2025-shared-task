The MeaningBERT score of 0.65 is substantially below the required 0.75 threshold.

The original text's concepts of 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication' are critical. Your version reduces these to 'think bad things' and 'stop people from talking to each other well', which does not preserve the weight or specific meaning of the source material.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: This score indicates a loss of key vocabulary and phrasing. The original text contains specific terms like 'international borders', 'cultural norms', and 'business communication'. These were replaced with overly generic phrases like 'different countries' and 'these ways', failing to maintain lexical fidelity.\n\n- Structural Issue: The sentence 'You might think bad things about people that are not true' uses a relative 'that-clause', which is a B1-level structure. This construction is too complex for the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts of 'unfair judgements' and 'communication problems' using simple A2 vocabulary. Split the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two separate, simple sentences. Example: 'You might think bad things about people. These things are not true.'",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The primary reason for failure is the inability to preserve the original text's core message, as evidenced by the metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6389 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. The BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the required 0.90.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The original text discusses 'unfair judgements' and 'breakdowns in communication'. Your version simplifies these to 'think bad things about people' and 'people cannot talk to each other well'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the professional context and severity of the original concepts.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score is low because key lexical items from the original were completely removed, not simplified. Phrases like 'cultural norms and practices' and 'stand you in good stead' carry specific meaning that was lost, damaging the fidelity of the text.\n\n- CEFR Level: While the text was correctly classified as A2, achieving the level is irrelevant if the core meaning is not preserved. The simplification was too aggressive.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to restore the original meaning while maintaining A2 simplicity. Instead of 'think bad things', use a phrase that captures the idea of incorrect judgment, such as 'get the wrong idea about people'. Instead of 'cannot talk to each other well', use a phrase that implies a complete stop, such as 'communication can stop working'.",
