Your text simplifies this to 'a woman has about two babies'.

This indicates a failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The original text establishes a direct causal link: 'with the wider availability of contraception... the global average number of babies... has declined'. Your version separates these into two sentences: 'more people could get contraception. So, women started to have fewer babies.' This separation weakens the explicit cause-and-effect relationship, which is the central point of that sentence. The low MeaningBERT score reflects this loss of meaning.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): The B1-level word 'global' was used twice. This is a violation of the A2 vocabulary standard. All vocabulary must be strictly A2 or below.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the direct causal link. Rephrase to connect the two ideas more strongly, for example: 'Because more people could get contraception, the average number of babies for each woman became smaller.'\n\nSuggestion: Replace the B1 word 'global'.
