The simplification was too aggressive for an original text that was already quite clear. While successfully replacing words like 'devalued' with 'less valued' and 'temptation' with 'urge', the overall effect, combined with the removal of 'constructive' from 'constructive criticism', pushed the text into the A2 level. To correct this, consider reintroducing a small amount of B1-level complexity. For example, keeping the phrase 'constructive criticism' is appropriate for a B1 audience, as it is a common and useful collocation. The text passed all factual and meaning preservation checks, but failed to meet the specific complexity requirement.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The output was classified as B2, which is too complex for the target B1 level. The primary reason for this failure is the combination of the first two original sentences into one overly long and structurally complex sentence. The clause '...the positive feedback, which should be valued on its own, can become devalued...' uses an embedded non-defining relative clause, a feature more typical of B2 and higher levels. Additionally, the B2-level vocabulary word 'resist' was not simplified. Suggestion: Split the first long sentence into two simpler sentences. Replace 'resist' with a B1 alternative such as 'avoid' or 'try not to'.",
