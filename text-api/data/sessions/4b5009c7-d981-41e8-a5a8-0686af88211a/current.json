    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the high MeaningBERT (0.95) and BERTScore (0.97) confirm that the core message and key details were preserved. The output correctly achieves the target B1 level. The vocabulary strategy was excellent, particularly in replacing more complex phrases like 'ensure there are times' with the more accessible 'make sure there are moments', and simplifying the idiomatic 'resist the temptation' to the direct 'Try not to'. No major improvements are needed.",
