        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The submission fails on two priority metrics. The MeaningBERT score of 0.734 is below the required 0.75 threshold, and the BERTScore of 0.8833 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and lexical detail.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text explains that a dream matching a real event is a 'coincidence'. Your text omits this concept entirely, which fundamentally changes the meaning of the final sentences.\n- Structural Failure: The sentence 'So they reach eighty.' is a grammatical fragment. It does not make sense on its own and fails to connect the age to the total number of dreams, a key point in the original text.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'percent' is B1 level. It was not replaced with an A2-compliant alternative.\n- Excessive Fragmentation: The text is broken into unnaturally short, disconnected sentences. 'Especially when the dream is about something that happens often. It happens in everyday life.' should be a single, coherent sentence to maintain logical flow.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the concept of 'coincidence'. Rewrite fragmented sentences to form complete, logical thoughts. For example, combine 'So they reach eighty' with the following sentence to state 'By the time a person is eighty years old, they may have...'. Replace 'percent' with an A2 phrase like '95 out of 100'.",

Your version breaks this explanation into a list of disconnected statements, completely losing the logical argument. The sentences 'It can happen by chance' and 'It often happens when the dream is about something that happens often' are presented as separate facts, not as the reason for the phenomenon.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'means' in the sentence 'This means we still remember...' is B2 level. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary list.\n\nSuggestion: Your primary task is to restore the original text's logical connection.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8832 is below the required 0.90 threshold. This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The loss of fidelity is caused by oversimplification and removal of phrases. The original's introductory clause 'It's not too difficult to believe that' was completely removed, which lowers the lexical match.\n- The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. This creates a choppy, unnatural rhythm that is below A2 standard. For example, 'Sometimes a dream is followed by a real event. The real event is similar.' should be a single sentence.\n- The sentence 'This is in a person's life' is grammatically awkward and should be integrated with the previous sentence for clarity and flow.\n\nSuggestion: Retain more of the original's specific vocabulary to meet the fidelity requirement. Combine fragmented sentences using simple connectors like 'and'. Rephrase 'Sometimes a dream is followed by a real event. The real event is similar.' to 'Sometimes a dream is followed by a similar real event.' Rephrase 'We may remember a few thousand dreams. This is in a person's life.' to 'We may remember a few thousand dreams in our life.'",
