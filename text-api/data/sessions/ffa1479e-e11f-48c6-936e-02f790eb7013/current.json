    "grade": 7,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8959 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a loss of key phrasing from the original text. The original states a real-life event is 'similar to' a dream event. Your version, 'a real event can follow a dream', loses this critical concept of similarity. While the text successfully maintains factual integrity and passes the CEFR A2 classification, this loss of lexical detail is a critical failure.\n\nDetected Deviations:\nThe BERTScore is 0.0041 below the minimum threshold. The meaning of 'similar' was completely omitted from the final sentences. The phrase 'It's not too difficult to believe' was simplified to 'It is easy to think', which slightly alters the original's logical tone.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase the sentence to include the concept of similarity. For example: 'Sometimes, a real event happens that is like a dream.' This phrasing is A2-compliant and restores fidelity to the original text.",
