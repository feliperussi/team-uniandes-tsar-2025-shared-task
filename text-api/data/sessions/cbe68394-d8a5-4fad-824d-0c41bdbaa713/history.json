This indicates a minor but significant deviation from the original text's core message. The likely cause is the replacement of 'disposable clothing problem' with 'clothing waste problem'. While 'waste' is a good simplification, the term 'disposable' carries a stronger, more specific connotation of a throw-away culture which was slightly lost in the output. To correct this, consider a phrase that captures this nuance, such as 'the problem with throw-away clothing'. On a positive note, the text is factually accurate, correctly classified at B1, and demonstrates excellent structure with good use of connectors. The definition for 'fast fashion' was also integrated perfectly.",

While this is a good simplification technique, it slightly alters the semantic structure, which can lower the score.

The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The key strength of this output is the excellent handling of the keyword 'fast fashion', which was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence using a relative clause. Furthermore, the writer improved the structure by splitting the final complex sentence into two, using appropriate B1 connectors like 'However' and 'In addition' to create a logical and easy-to-follow text. Vocabulary choices were also strong, simplifying where necessary (e.g., 'abroad' to 'other countries') while retaining essential B1 terms.",
