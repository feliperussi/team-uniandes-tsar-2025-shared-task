However, charity shops are not able to sell all of these clothes. **Fast fashion, which is cheap clothing that is made and sold very quickly,** goes out of fashion as fast as it became popular, and its quality is often too poor for it to be recycled or for people to want to buy it second-hand. Because of this, huge amounts of clothes end up being thrown away. In addition, many of the clothes that charities cannot sell are sent to other countries, which causes even more economic and environmental problems there.",

    "feedback": "This is an exemplary simplification that passes all checks. Factual integrity is perfectly maintained. The MeaningBERT (0.79) and BERTScore (0.94) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent preservation of the original message and key details. The B1 CEFR classification is accurate. The key strength of this output is the excellent handling of the keyword 'fast fashion', which was defined clearly and naturally within the sentence using a relative clause. Furthermore, the writer improved the structure by splitting the final complex sentence into two, using appropriate B1 connectors like 'However' and 'In addition' to create a logical and easy-to-follow text. Vocabulary choices were also strong, simplifying where necessary (e.g., 'abroad' to 'other countries') while retaining essential B1 terms.",
