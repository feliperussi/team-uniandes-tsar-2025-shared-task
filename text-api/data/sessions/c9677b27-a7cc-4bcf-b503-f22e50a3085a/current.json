    "feedback": "PASS: The text is an exemplary model of A2 simplification.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, locations (Vancouver, Mumbai, Berlin), and animal examples from the original text are perfectly preserved.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.76 and BERTScore of 0.9375 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The A2 classification is correct. The text avoids all B1-level complexity.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. The simplification of the B1 word 'pest' to the A1 word 'problem' is a correct and effective adaptation. The sentence structure is ideal for the A2 level, breaking down complex sentences from the original into short, simple, and clear statements.",
