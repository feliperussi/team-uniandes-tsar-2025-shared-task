Any omission of factual detail is an absolute failure.\n\nFAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6511 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a severe deviation from the original text's core message. Your simplification has resulted in a text that no longer conveys the same meaning.\n\n- Deviation: The phrase 'the world's press has been full of reports' implies a global, ongoing, and significant media event. Your version, 'Newspapers and TV news talk about this a lot,' reduces this to a generic statement and loses the intended gravity.\n- Deviation: The original asks if animals are 'considered a danger or a pest'. Your text splits this into 'a danger' and 'a problem'. While 'problem' is a valid A2 word, it does not accurately capture the meaning of 'pest' (an annoying creature that causes damage). This substitution contributed to the low meaning score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore all factual details from the original text without exception. Re-evaluate every simplification to ensure it preserves the original meaning, not just the surface-level words. The goal is simplification, not alteration.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. While the individual facts are present, the overall tone and emphasis have been lost. The original text conveys a sense of scale and increasing frequency with phrases like 'full of reports' and 'bigger and bigger numbers'. Your version, 'Newspapers all over the world write about this' and 'More and more wild animals', is a substantial dilution of this meaning. The simplification has removed the intensity of the original message, which is an unacceptable deviation. Although the BERTScore of 0.9157 is acceptable and the text correctly classifies as A2, the failure to maintain the original's core meaning is an overriding error. Suggestion: Restore the original's emphasis. The concept of news being 'full of reports' must be communicated more strongly. The idea of animal numbers growing 'bigger and bigger' must be preserved, not just stated as 'more and more'.",

This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text. The original text asks if animals are 'considered a danger or a pest', which is a question about societal perception and classification. Your version changes this to 'do people think they are a danger?' and 'do people think they are just unwanted animals?'. This shift from the formal concept of 'considered' to the more personal 'think' dilutes the meaning. Furthermore, simplifying 'pest' to 'unwanted animals' loses the specific connotation of a nuisance animal that causes damage, which is central to the original question. While the BERTScore of 0.92 is acceptable, the loss of semantic meaning is a primary failure. The text correctly classifies as A2 and uses appropriate sentence structure, but this does not compensate for the failure to maintain the original meaning. Suggestion: Restore the original meaning. Rephrase the final questions to better capture the concept of societal perception. The simplification of 'pest' must be re-evaluated to retain its core meaning of being a nuisance, not just being 'unwanted'.",
