All numbers and core concepts are preserved.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8152 and BERTScore of 0.9419 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classified as A2. The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfectly aligned with this level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text is a model of A2 simplification. Complex concepts like 'abandoned' and 'adapted remarkably successfully' were correctly simplified to 'owners left them' and 'live very well in the city'. Sentence structure is consistently simple, using short sentences and basic A2 connectors ('but', 'and'). No vocabulary above the A2 level was used. The output meets all protocol requirements without deviation.",
