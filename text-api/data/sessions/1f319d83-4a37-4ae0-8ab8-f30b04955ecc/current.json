    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, numbers, and core concepts from the original text have been preserved with 100% accuracy.\n- Metric Compliance: The text exceeds all metric thresholds. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8152 and BERTScore of 0.9419 confirm excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier result of A2 is correct.\n- Vocabulary Control: The vocabulary is strictly confined to the A2 level. B1 terms such as 'abandoned', 'packs', and 'adapted' were correctly simplified to 'left them', 'groups', and 'live very well'.\n- Structural Simplification: The original text's complex sentences were systematically broken down into short, simple declarative sentences. This is a model execution of A2 structural requirements.",
