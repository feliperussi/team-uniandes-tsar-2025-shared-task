    "text_translated": "Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we started to see signs of early human culture. For example, we can see this in paintings found in caves. However, no one knows the connection between this new culture and language. Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but people became more complex and more intelligent. Did using language cause their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start to create language?",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The structure and flow are very good. You successfully transformed a complex sentence from the original text into three clear, simple, and connected sentences. Your use of connectors like 'For example' and 'However' is precise and demonstrates the B1 ability to link ideas logically. The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for this level, using core B1 words like 'connection' and 'complex' correctly while simplifying more advanced concepts appropriately (e.g., 'civilisation' to 'culture'). The text is factually accurate and easy to understand, fully meeting the B1 standard for writing simple, connected text.",
