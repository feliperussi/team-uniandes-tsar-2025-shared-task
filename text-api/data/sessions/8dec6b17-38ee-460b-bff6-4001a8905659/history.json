A B1 assessment evaluates your ability to write simple, connected text on familiar topics. Without a written paragraph, it is impossible to assess this skill."

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1 writing. The structure and flow are very good. You successfully transformed a complex sentence from the original text into three clear, simple, and connected sentences. Your use of connectors like 'For example' and 'However' is precise and demonstrates the B1 ability to link ideas logically. The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for this level, using core B1 words like 'connection' and 'complex' correctly while simplifying more advanced concepts appropriately (e.g., 'civilisation' to 'culture'). The text is factually accurate and easy to understand, fully meeting the B1 standard for writing simple, connected text."
