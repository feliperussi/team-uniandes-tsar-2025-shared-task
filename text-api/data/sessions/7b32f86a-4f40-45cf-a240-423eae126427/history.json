This comparison is a key part of the original message and its removal caused the low fidelity score.\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'When you listen to \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d, the stories stay important' uses a subordinate clause starting with 'When'. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard. A2 texts must use simple sentences connected by 'and', 'but', 'so', or 'because'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the omitted meaning with a simple sentence. For example: 'Many famous singers do not make new music when they are older. But Bruce Springsteen is different.' Split the complex sentence into two simple sentences. For example: 'You can listen to his song \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d. The stories in the song are still important today.'",

The text fails on two primary metrics, indicating a critical loss of meaning and fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6603 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text states Springsteen is at the 'top of his game,' meaning he performs at his peak ability. Your text incorrectly changes this to 'the best singer,' which is a subjective and factually different claim. This is a severe meaning shift.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8607 is below the 0.90 minimum. This failure is caused by excessive replacement of key vocabulary. The original's specific, descriptive terms ('chart-topping', 'stadium-filling', 'best-selling album artists') were replaced with overly generic phrases ('number one', 'very big places', 'famous singers'), stripping the text of its lexical precision.\n\n- Structural Degradation: The original text's comparative structure ('Unlike many other...') is completely lost. Your version is a list of simple, disconnected statements that fails to convey the relationships between the ideas.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the original meaning. Correct the factual error 'best singer' to a phrase like 'he still performs very well'. Re-introduce the comparison to other artists at the beginning.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The text also fails the fidelity check, with a BERTScore of 0.86, below the minimum of 0.90.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text describes Springsteen telling 'our most fundamental stories about ourselves'. Your version, 'He tells big stories about us', is an oversimplification that loses the critical concept of 'fundamental' and personal connection.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: The BERTScore is low because key descriptive phrases from the original were completely removed instead of being simplified. 'Chart-topping' and 'stadium-filling' were replaced with the generic 'very popular' and 'play in big places', losing factual detail and lexical fidelity.\n\n- Structural Issues: The text is broken into too many short, disconnected sentences. This choppy structure contributes to the loss of meaning and makes the text read at an A1 level, not A2.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'making' is a B2-level gerund. This is an unacceptable deviation for the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase to better capture the original meaning. Combine short sentences using A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so'. Find closer A2 equivalents for key concepts; for example, 'chart-topping' can be simplified to 'his songs are number one' which is more precise than 'very popular'. Replace the word 'making'.",

The simplification is too aggressive, sacrificing lexical fidelity. The phrase 'best-selling album artists' was replaced with 'singers who have many albums', losing the specific concept of 'best-selling'. The phrase 'remains at the top of his game' was simplified to 'is still one of the best singers', which loses the idiomatic meaning and lexical detail. The text was broken into too many short, disconnected sentences, which further reduced its fidelity to the original's structure. Suggestion: Revise the text to re-integrate key vocabulary from the source. Combine some sentences to better reflect the original's flow while maintaining A2 simplicity. For example, 'Many singers with best-selling albums stop making new music, but Bruce Springsteen is different'.",

This indicates a significant loss of key words and phrasing from the original text, failing a primary diagnostic check.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Fidelity Loss: The low BERTScore is a direct result of replacing specific concepts like 'fundamental stories' and 'relevant today' with the generic term 'important'. This simplification loses too much of the original's lexical detail.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The text includes the word 'making', which is classified as B2 level. All vocabulary must conform to the A2 standard. This word should have been replaced.\n- Structural Error: The line 'When you listen to his song \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d.' is a sentence fragment. A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. This is a fundamental grammatical error.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Suggestion: Correct the sentence fragment. Combine 'When you listen to his song \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d' with the following sentence to form a complete thought.\n- Suggestion: Remove the B2 word 'making'. Rephrase the first sentence to use A2 vocabulary, for example: 'Many best-selling album artists stop releasing new music...'\n- Suggestion: To improve fidelity, find closer A2-level synonyms for the original's concepts instead of defaulting to overly simple words.",

The original states the stories are 'as relevant today as they ever were'. Your version, 'the stories stay most important today', completely loses the critical comparison to the past ('as they ever were'). This is a major loss of meaning and the direct cause of the low fidelity score.\n- The replacement of 'relevant' with 'important' is an acceptable vocabulary simplification for A2, but when combined with the severe structural simplification, it contributes to the overall fidelity failure.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the final sentence to restore the lost meaning. Use a simple structure to make the comparison. Command: Change 'the stories stay most important today' to 'The stories are important today, just like they were in the past.'",
