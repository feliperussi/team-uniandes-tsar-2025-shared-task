    "text_translated": "It is good to know that people can act in different ways. This helps us talk to people without problems. But it is very important to remember one thing. We should not use stereotypes. Stereotypes are simple ideas about what a group of people is like. These ideas are often not true. It is bad for business when you use stereotypes. The culture of our country can change how we act and think. But many other things also change us. For example, the place we come from changes us. The people we know, our age, and if we are a man or a woman also change us. Our company and our life also change how we are. So, we should remember that people can be different. But we should not use this idea to think all people from a country are the same.",
