    "feedback": "The text successfully passed all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification for a B1 audience. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Meaning preservation was strong, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8543, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original's key terms and phrasing was also high, with a BERTScore of 0.9187, exceeding the 0.90 requirement. Crucially, the text was accurately classified as B1 by the CEFR classifier, meeting the target complexity level. The writer's strategy for handling vocabulary was particularly effective. The keyword 'evolution' was defined accurately and integrated seamlessly into the sentence ('evolution, which is the way living things change and develop over a long time'). Complex phrases such as 'augmenting our bodies' were appropriately simplified to 'making our bodies better,' and 'audiovisual perception' was clearly rendered as 'seeing and hearing.' The sentence structure was also skillfully adapted, breaking down longer, more complex sentences from the original into shorter, more manageable units for a B1 reader, which significantly aids comprehension. The flow of the text is natural and coherent, using appropriate B1 connectors to guide the reader. This is a very strong submission that exemplifies effective text simplification.",
