For example, 'fascinating to consider' was simplified to 'very interesting to think about', 'augmenting our bodies' to 'adding things to our bodies', 'implant a computer' to 'put a computer', 'enhance our mathematical ability' to 'make our math skills better', 'audiovisual perception' to 'improve how we see and hear things', and 'commonplace' to 'normal'. These vocabulary choices and simplified phrasings are characteristic of an A2 level. To achieve B1, the text should aim for slightly more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures, while still being clear. For instance, 'fascinating' could be retained, or 'consider' could be used. 'Augmenting' could be simplified to 'improving' or 'enhancing' rather than 'adding things'. The definition of 'evolution' was well-handled, but the surrounding language needs to be elevated slightly to meet the B1 target.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the required 'B1' level. This is primarily due to the use of vocabulary and sentence structure that exceeds the B1 threshold. Words such as 'enhancing', 'audiovisual perception', 'mathematical ability', and 'commonplace' are generally considered B2 or higher. For instance, 'audiovisual perception' is a complex noun phrase that is too advanced for B1. Furthermore, the first sentence, 'I think it's fascinating to consider how we can speed up our evolution, which is the way living things change and develop over a long time, by enhancing our bodies,' is quite long and uses a complex relative clause ('which is the way living things change and develop over a long time') combined with higher-level vocabulary, making it challenging for a B1 reader. To achieve B1, simplify vocabulary (e.g., 'enhancing' to 'improving' or 'making better', 'audiovisual perception' to 'seeing and hearing', 'commonplace' to 'normal' or 'usual'). Also, consider splitting longer sentences or rephrasing complex clauses to be more direct. The definition of 'evolution' was well-handled, and the factual integrity and meaning preservation were excellent.",

        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passed all priority checks, demonstrating excellent simplification for a B1 audience. Factual integrity was perfectly maintained, with no discrepancies found between the original and simplified versions. Meaning preservation was strong, as indicated by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8543, well above the 0.75 threshold. Fidelity to the original's key terms and phrasing was also high, with a BERTScore of 0.9187, exceeding the 0.90 requirement. Crucially, the text was accurately classified as B1 by the CEFR classifier, meeting the target complexity level. The writer's strategy for handling vocabulary was particularly effective. The keyword 'evolution' was defined accurately and integrated seamlessly into the sentence ('evolution, which is the way living things change and develop over a long time'). Complex phrases such as 'augmenting our bodies' were appropriately simplified to 'making our bodies better,' and 'audiovisual perception' was clearly rendered as 'seeing and hearing.' The sentence structure was also skillfully adapted, breaking down longer, more complex sentences from the original into shorter, more manageable units for a B1 reader, which significantly aids comprehension. The flow of the text is natural and coherent, using appropriate B1 connectors to guide the reader. This is a very strong submission that exemplifies effective text simplification.",
