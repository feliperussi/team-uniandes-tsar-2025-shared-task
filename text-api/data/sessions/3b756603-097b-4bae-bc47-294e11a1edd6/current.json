    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all diagnostic checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT score of 0.9453 and BERTScore of 0.9788 are well above the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, meeting the target complexity. The writer effectively simplified vocabulary, replacing 'the public' with 'people', 'environment' with 'place', and 'habitats' with 'homes', which are appropriate for a B1 audience. Crucially, the keyword 'conservation' was expertly defined in context ('which means problems related to protecting animals and nature'), enhancing comprehension without disrupting the flow. The sentence structure and use of connectors are suitable for the B1 level, ensuring good readability. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
