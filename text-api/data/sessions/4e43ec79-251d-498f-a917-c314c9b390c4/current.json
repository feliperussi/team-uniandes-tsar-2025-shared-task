    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6355 is below the required 0.75. The core message regarding the transformation of 'underutilised items' into 'assets' from which 'profit' can be generated through 'sharing' is significantly diluted. The original text clearly states 'generate profit from the sharing of those underused assets', while your version simplifies this to 'online groups find ways to make money. They share these things that have value.' This simplification loses the specific economic mechanism and the concept of leveraging underused items. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly connect the act of sharing underused items with the generation of profit, ensuring the economic aspect is not lost. For example, 'Online groups now find ways to make money by sharing things that people do not use often but still have value.'",
