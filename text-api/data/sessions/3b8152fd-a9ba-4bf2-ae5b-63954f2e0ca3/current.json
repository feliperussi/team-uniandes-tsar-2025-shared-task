    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all evaluation criteria. It maintains complete factual integrity, accurately reflecting all information from the original text without any discrepancies. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8381 and BERTScore of 0.9478 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'collapses' by stating 'it means it falls down', which is a highly effective simplification strategy. Furthermore, complex phrases like 'conduct a complete investigation' were appropriately simplified to 'do a full study', 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad material', and 'defect in a key piece' to 'problem in an important part'. Sentence structures were also simplified by splitting longer sentences, enhancing readability without losing coherence. This is a well-executed simplification.",
