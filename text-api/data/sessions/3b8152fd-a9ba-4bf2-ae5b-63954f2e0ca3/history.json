While the text maintains most of the factual information, the overall semantic similarity to the original has been significantly reduced according to this metric. This could be attributed to the addition of the explicit definition 'which means it falls down' for 'collapses', which, while helpful for simplification, was not present in the original and may have altered the core semantic representation. Additionally, the rephrasing of 'Some bridge collapses are mysteries' to 'Sometimes, when a bridge collapses... engineers do not understand why' might have subtly shifted the emphasis or nuance of the opening statement, contributing to the lower score. To improve, ensure that any additions or rephrasing, even for clarity, do not inadvertently dilute the original's core message or semantic structure as measured by MeaningBERT.",

The writer's output largely retains the original text's complexity in its core sentences. For instance, the sentence 'Some bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation' contains B2 vocabulary such as 'investigation' and a complex sentence structure. The sentence 'This could happen because inferior-quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge' also uses B2/C1 vocabulary like 'inferior-quality material', 'construction', and 'defect', and includes passive voice ('was used') which is typically B2. To achieve a B1 level, the writer must actively simplify these complex sentences, breaking them into shorter, more direct statements. Crucially, B2 and C1 vocabulary candidates such as 'investigation', 'construction', and 'defect' should be replaced with simpler B1 alternatives or rephrased for clarity at the B1 level.",

It maintains complete factual integrity, accurately reflecting all information from the original text without any discrepancies. The MeaningBERT score of 0.8381 and BERTScore of 0.9478 both exceed the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity to the original content. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating appropriate linguistic complexity for the target audience. The writer effectively defined the keyword 'collapses' by stating 'it means it falls down', which is a highly effective simplification strategy. Furthermore, complex phrases like 'conduct a complete investigation' were appropriately simplified to 'do a full study', 'inferior-quality material' to 'bad material', and 'defect in a key piece' to 'problem in an important part'. Sentence structures were also simplified by splitting longer sentences, enhancing readability without losing coherence. This is a well-executed simplification.",
