    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts from the original text are present and correct.\n- Meaning Preservation: The MeaningBERT score of 0.91 and BERTScore of 0.92 are well above the required thresholds, confirming high fidelity to the source material.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2, meeting the target level precisely.\n- Vocabulary Audit: The vocabulary is strictly limited to A1 and A2 levels. The simplification of 'identical' to 'look the same' and 'huge, colourful' to 'big bright' is an exemplary execution of A2 standards.\n- Structural Analysis: The text uses short, simple sentences. The original complex sentence structure ('...so big that they need...') was correctly simplified into a basic cause-and-effect sentence using 'so', which is ideal for the A2 level. The text is a model of A2 simplification.",
