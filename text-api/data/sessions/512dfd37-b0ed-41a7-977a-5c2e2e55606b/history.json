        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The statement 'They need cranes to lift their paint' is a factual error. The original text states cranes are needed 'to help them work', which implies the cranes lift the artists to the work area. Your version misrepresents this core fact. This is an instant failure of the primary protocol.\n\n- Factual Error: The purpose of the cranes is incorrect. The original text implies the cranes lift the artists. Your text states they lift the paint. This is a complete misinterpretation of the source material.\n\n- Awkward Phrasing: The phrase 'same twin brothers' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. While 'identical' is a B1 word, the replacement must be a correct A2 structure, such as 'They are twin brothers and they look the same'.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The text is excessively fragmented. Separating 'Their work is big' from 'They need cranes...' destroys the cause-and-effect relationship ('so big that...') present in the original text. The meaning is weakened.\n\n- Grammatical Error: The final sentence is missing an article. It should be 'they painted a whole castle' to be grammatically correct.\n\nSuggestion: Correct the factual error about the cranes immediately. Rephrase 'same twin brothers' to be grammatically correct. Connect the ideas about the size of the work and the need for cranes using a simple connector like 'so' or 'because'.",

The simplification of 'identical' to 'look the same' and 'huge, colourful' to 'big bright' is an exemplary execution of A2 standards.\n- Structural Analysis: The text uses short, simple sentences. The original complex sentence structure ('...so big that they need...') was correctly simplified into a basic cause-and-effect sentence using 'so', which is ideal for the A2 level. The text is a model of A2 simplification.",
