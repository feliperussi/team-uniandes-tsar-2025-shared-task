These large families produced even more children. These children survived into adulthood and had their own children. But in the 1960s, it became easier to get `contraception` (a way to stop women from getting pregnant). Because of this, the average number of babies per woman in the world has gone down. It went from six babies to as low as two.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully simplifies the original content while maintaining full factual integrity and meaning. All metrics passed, with MeaningBERT at 0.8323 and BERTScore at 0.9517, both well above the required thresholds. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the output as B1, demonstrating effective simplification to the target level. The writer effectively broke down complex sentences from the original into shorter, more manageable sentences, improving readability for a B1 audience. For example, the original's complex sentence 'In the last two centuries, improvements in technology and health meant fewer children died young, fuelling rapid population growth' was skillfully transformed into three simpler sentences: 'In the last two centuries, technology and health improved. This meant fewer children died young. This caused the world's population to grow quickly.' The keyword 'contraception' was accurately and clearly defined in context, which is excellent for B1 comprehension. The use of B1 connectors like 'This meant', 'This caused', and 'Because of this' helps maintain a logical flow. The vocabulary choices are appropriate for the B1 level, with no unnecessary simplifications or overly complex terms. This is a strong example of effective text simplification.",
