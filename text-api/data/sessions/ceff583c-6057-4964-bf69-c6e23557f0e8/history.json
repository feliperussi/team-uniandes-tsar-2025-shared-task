This is a critical failure to preserve the specific wording and key details of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation (BERTScore): The score indicates a loss of lexical fidelity. The original text's specific, descriptive phrases like 'chart-topping' and 'top of his game' were replaced with overly generic A2 terms like 'very popular' and 'one of the best'. This simplification sacrifices too much of the original's precision.\n\n- Secondary Deviation (Vocabulary): A vocabulary violation was detected. The word 'stadiums' is B1 level and is not permitted. All vocabulary must strictly adhere to the A2 list.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the meaning of the original's key phrases using A2 vocabulary. Instead of 'very popular', use a phrase that explains 'chart-topping', such as 'His new songs are number one'. Replace the B1 word 'stadiums' with an A2-compliant description, such as 'He plays music in very big places for many people'.",

The language used is too complex for an A2 reader.\n\n- Advanced Vocabulary: The B2-level word 'fundamental' was copied directly from the source text. This word is not on the A2 list and must be replaced.\n\n- Idiomatic Language: The phrase 'at the top of his game' is a B2/C1 level idiom. This is completely inappropriate for an A2 text and demonstrates a failure to simplify complex concepts.\n\n- Complex Structures: The compound adjectives 'chart-topping' and 'stadium-filling' are B1-level structures. A2 texts require simpler phrasing.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove the word 'fundamental'. Replace it with 'important' or 'basic'.\n\n- Suggestion: Remove the idiom 'at the top of his game'. Rephrase it with a simple sentence, such as 'He is still a very good singer.'\n\n- Suggestion: Deconstruct the compound adjectives.
