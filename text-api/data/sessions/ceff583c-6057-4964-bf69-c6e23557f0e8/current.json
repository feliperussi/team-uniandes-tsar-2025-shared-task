    "text_translated": "Some singers sell more albums than anyone else. But Springsteen is different from them. He is almost 70 years old. He still makes new music. His new music goes to the top of the charts. He plays shows in big stadiums. The stadiums are always full. He is still at the top. I am not surprised by this. He tells our most important stories about ourselves. You can listen to his album *Born in the USA*. The stories are as important for people now as they were in the past.",

The output successfully passes all diagnostic checks.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All facts, names, and concepts from the original text are preserved without error.\n- Meaning and Fidelity Metrics: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8615 and BERTScore of 0.9045 are both above the required thresholds, confirming the core message and key terms were maintained.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly classified as A2.\n- Qualitative Audit: The text demonstrates a masterful simplification to the A2 level. Complex B2-level vocabulary ('fundamental', 'relevant') was correctly replaced with the A1 word 'important'. Compound adjectives ('chart-topping', 'stadium-filling') were correctly deconstructed into a series of short, simple sentences. The structure is a model of A2 clarity. No deviations were found.",
