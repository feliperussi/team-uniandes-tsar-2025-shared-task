    "text_translated": "NASA is now working to record smaller **asteroids**, which are rocks that fly through space. They are looking for those that are 140 metres wide or more. Scientists think there are about 25,000 asteroids of this size, but they have only found about 8,000 so far. These middle-sized asteroids can be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit. For example, a much smaller asteroid hurt 1,200 people when it blew up over a Russian city in 2013.",
