    "text_translated": "Civilisation is when people live together in groups. They have art, rules, and ideas. Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we see signs of early human civilisation. For example, people made pictures inside big rocks. But no one knows the link between this and language. People's brains did not get bigger quickly. But people became smarter and their lives were not simple. Did using language make their brains grow? Or did their better brains start to make language?",
