While the meaning is largely preserved, the slight semantic shifts, such as simplifying 'Throughout history and across cultures' to 'For a long time, people in all countries' and 'associated with prophecy' to 'could show the future', resulted in a score that did not meet the strict numerical requirement. The original text conveys a slightly stronger and more specific connection to divine prophecy and historical continuity that was not fully captured. Suggestion: Ensure all core nuances, even when simplified, maintain a semantic similarity score of 0.75 or above.",
