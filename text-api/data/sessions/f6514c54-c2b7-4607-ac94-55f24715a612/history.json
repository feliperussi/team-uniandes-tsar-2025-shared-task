This indicates a severe loss of the original message and its specific vocabulary.\n\n- Meaning Loss: The original text's focus on 'profitability' and companies 'seeking to gain' was reduced to the overly simple phrase 'make money', losing the core business concept. The idea of 'lucrative accommodation' is lost.\n\n- Fidelity Loss: Key lexical items like 'underutilised resources', 'profitability', and 'lucrative accommodation' were completely removed, causing the low fidelity score.\n\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The text received a B1 classification, which is an instant fail. This is a direct result of using B1 vocabulary. The word 'economy' from the keyword 'sharing economy' is a B1 term. The word 'resources' is also B1. These words must be replaced or the concepts explained using only A2 vocabulary.\n\n- Structural Failure: The text is excessively fragmented into short, disconnected sentences. This oversimplification contributes to the meaning loss and makes the text read like a list, not a coherent paragraph.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase to explain the concepts without using the B1 terms 'economy' and 'resources'. Combine some of the short sentences using simple connectors like 'and' or 'so' to create better flow. Restore the concept of businesses wanting to make a lot of money, not just 'extra money'.",

Your version reduces these to 'things people need less' and 'earn money', which is an unacceptable loss of meaning and precision.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text B1, not the required A2. This is a direct violation of the core requirement. The presence of the B1-level compound noun 'sharing economy', even with a definition, elevates the text's complexity beyond the A2 threshold.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The term 'economy' is B1. It must be removed or defined in a way that does not require its use in the main body of the text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts from the original text using A2 vocabulary. The idea that resources are 'unused' or 'extra' is critical and has been lost. The concept of 'profit' is stronger than just 'earn money' and must be conveyed more accurately.
