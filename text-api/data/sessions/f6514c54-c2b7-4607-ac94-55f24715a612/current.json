    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.8496 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a critical loss of key lexical information from the original text.\n\n- Fidelity Failure (BERTScore): The score is too low because your simplification removed essential concepts. The original text specifies 'underutilised resources', 'profitability', and 'lucrative accommodation'. Your version reduces these to 'things people need less' and 'earn money', which is an unacceptable loss of meaning and precision.\n- CEFR Compliance Failure: The classifier rated the text B1, not the required A2. This is a direct violation of the core requirement. The presence of the B1-level compound noun 'sharing economy', even with a definition, elevates the text's complexity beyond the A2 threshold.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The term 'economy' is B1. It must be removed or defined in a way that does not require its use in the main body of the text.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts from the original text using A2 vocabulary. The idea that resources are 'unused' or 'extra' is critical and has been lost. The concept of 'profit' is stronger than just 'earn money' and must be conveyed more accurately. Rewrite the text to avoid using the B1 term 'sharing economy' after its initial definition. The text must be simplified while maintaining lexical fidelity to the source.",
