        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the required 'B1'. The primary reason is the complex sentence structure in the first sentence: '...meant that fewer children died young, which caused the world population to grow quickly.' The use of 'which' to refer to the entire preceding clause is a B2-level structure. Additionally, the output uses the B2-level adverb 'widely'. To meet the B1 requirement, split the first sentence into two simpler sentences, for example: 'This meant that fewer children died young. As a result, the world population grew quickly.' Also, replace 'widely available' with a B1-level phrase like 'easy for people to get'.",

        "feedback_text": "This is a high-quality simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and the MeaningBERT (0.87) and BERTScore (0.96) are well above the required thresholds, confirming excellent meaning preservation. The text correctly achieves the target B1 CEFR level. Strengths include the effective splitting of the first sentence and the use of the B1 connector 'As a result', which improves flow. The simplification of the concept 'wider availability' to 'easy for people to get' is an excellent strategy. For future improvement, note the addition of the word 'about' before 'six'. The original text states a specific number, and adding 'about' introduces a minor imprecision. While not a failure, maintaining the exact number would be preferable for maximum fidelity. Overall, this is a very strong submission.",
