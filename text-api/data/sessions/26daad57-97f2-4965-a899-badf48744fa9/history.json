The original text conveys a sense of 'lonely' places and the mystery of 'what was it like' and 'why did they leave', which implies a deeper emotional connection or historical curiosity. Your version uses 'strange' and directly asks 'Why did they go?', which simplifies the emotional depth and the implied mystery of the original's phrasing 'There's something about lonely, empty places.' The nuance of 'lonely' is not fully captured by 'strange'.\n\nDetected Deviations:\n- Vocabulary: The word 'signal' is classified as B1, which exceeds the A2 vocabulary standard. This must be replaced with simpler A2 terminology.\n\nCorrective Path:\n- Rephrase the section about the feeling of empty places to better capture the 'lonely' aspect and the implied mystery of the original text. For example, instead of 'Empty places feel strange', consider 'Empty places feel lonely' or 'Empty places make you think about the past'.\n- Replace 'phone signal' with an A2-appropriate phrase such as 'phone works' or 'can't use your phone'.",

The core message's nuance regarding why horror films 'love' these places is not fully preserved. The original text implies a deeper, almost psychological draw with 'There's something about lonely, empty places' and the practical 'handy' aspect for directors. Your version, 'Empty places feel quiet and alone' and 'Scary film makers like these places. It is easy to believe your phone does not work there. This helps the film story', simplifies these concepts too much. The phrase 'This helps the film story' is an added interpretation not explicitly in the original, which further deviates from the precise meaning. Suggestion: Rephrase to more accurately reflect the original's subtle reasons for appeal and the specific utility for film directors, ensuring the 'love' aspect is fully conveyed without adding new interpretations.",
