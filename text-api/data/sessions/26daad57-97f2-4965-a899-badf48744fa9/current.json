    "feedback": "PASS: The text successfully meets all CEFR A2 readability standards. It maintains factual integrity and core meaning, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.8437 (above 0.75) and BERTScore of 0.9195 (above 0.90). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A1/A2 range, and the sentence structures are consistently short and simple, using appropriate A2 connectors and grammatical forms. This is a well-executed simplification.",
