Combine some of the very short sentences using simple A2 connectors like 'and' or 'so' to improve flow and better match the original's structure.

This indicates a significant loss of key words and factual phrasing from the original text.\n\n- The simplification of 'evil psychopath has hidden their tools' to 'A bad person may hide things there' is too extreme. It loses the specific nouns 'psychopath' and 'tools', which are critical for fidelity.\n- The phrase 'The basement feels creepy' is a weaker statement than the original's 'basements are always creepy', further reducing the score by losing the sense of certainty.\n- The final sentence 'It stays creepy even without anything' is a grammatically awkward simplification of 'even when there isn't anything down there'.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key nouns from the original text while maintaining A2 simplicity. Rephrase 'A bad person may hide things there' to 'A very bad person hides tools there'. Change 'The basement feels creepy' to 'The basement is always creepy' to match the certainty of the original text.",

The failure is caused by replacing 'No matter what kind of house it is' with 'It can be in any house' and 'evil psychopath' with 'bad psychopath'. While the meaning is preserved and the vocabulary is A2 compliant, the fidelity to the source text's specific wording is insufficient. Suggestion: Revise to retain more of the original's specific vocabulary without increasing complexity. A more faithful simplification would be 'The basement is a scary place in any kind of house'.",

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The core context of the original text was lost. The original text states the basement is a scary place 'in horror films'. Your output makes a general statement that 'The basement is a scary place in any kind of house'. This is a critical error that changes the entire meaning of the passage from a comment on movie tropes to a statement about all houses.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'evil' is B1 level. It must be replaced with a simpler A2 alternative. For example, 'a very bad person'.\n- Meaning Shift: The original sentence 'where something is hiding or where the evil psychopath has hidden their tools' uses 'or' to present alternatives. Your version splits this into two separate statements, which slightly alters the logical connection.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the phrase 'in horror films' to the first sentence to maintain factual accuracy. Replace the B1 word 'evil' with an A2-compliant term like 'bad'.",
