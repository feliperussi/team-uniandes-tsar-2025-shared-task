    "grade": 2,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Factual Inaccuracy. The core context of the original text was lost. The original text states the basement is a scary place 'in horror films'. Your output makes a general statement that 'The basement is a scary place in any kind of house'. This is a critical error that changes the entire meaning of the passage from a comment on movie tropes to a statement about all houses.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word 'evil' is B1 level. It must be replaced with a simpler A2 alternative. For example, 'a very bad person'.\n- Meaning Shift: The original sentence 'where something is hiding or where the evil psychopath has hidden their tools' uses 'or' to present alternatives. Your version splits this into two separate statements, which slightly alters the logical connection.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the phrase 'in horror films' to the first sentence to maintain factual accuracy. Replace the B1 word 'evil' with an A2-compliant term like 'bad'.",
