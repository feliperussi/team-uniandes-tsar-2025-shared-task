Specific deviations include: The original text clearly states the purpose of the impact is to 'knock it out of its orbit enough for Earth-based telescopes to pick up'. Your version simplifies this to 'We hope this hit will push Didymoon a little. Then telescopes on Earth can see this change.' This loses the critical concept of 'orbit' and the 'enough' for observation, diluting the scientific goal. The name of the larger asteroid, 'Didymos', is omitted from the main explanation, only implied by 'Didymoon' and 'bigger space rock'. This removes a specific factual detail. Suggestion: Rephrase to explicitly state the goal of changing Didymoon's orbit. Ensure the connection between the orbital change and Earth-based observation is clear. Reintroduce the name 'Didymos' for the larger asteroid.",
