We should look for ways to offer more flexible working hours to our employees. We should also consider how we can allow them to work from the places they choose. Managers need to give our staff interesting tasks. They also need to give more positive feedback and praise for the work they do. Spending more money on professional training could also help create a positive workplace. This training should especially focus on communication skills. This will help employees to do their best work.",

        "feedback_text": "The submission fails because it uses B2-level vocabulary without providing the required definitions. Specifically, the words 'flexible' and 'workplace' are above the B1 core level and were not defined in the keywords section. At the B1 level, writers should primarily use familiar vocabulary or explain any advanced terms they choose to include. However, the text demonstrates strong B1-level competence in structure and flow. You successfully used a mix of simple and complex sentences (e.g., '...a management style that focuses more on its people') to create a coherent and well-connected paragraph. The summary is also factually accurate. To achieve a passing grade, you must adhere to the vocabulary requirements by either defining advanced words or replacing them with simpler B1 alternatives."

        "feedback_text": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. The structure is strong, featuring a good mix of simple and more complex sentences. For instance, using 'that' to connect clauses in '...a management style that focuses more on its people' is a clear sign of B1 proficiency. The flow is logical and coherent. The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for B1, effectively using words like 'suggest', 'focus', and 'feedback' to accurately paraphrase more advanced concepts from the original text, such as replacing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with 'positive feedback and praise'. All key information from the source text has been accurately retained without adding any personal interpretation. This is a very competent and clear piece of writing."
