    "text_translated": "Based on this information, we suggest that Girox Foods should use a management style that focuses more on its people. We should look for ways to offer working hours that can change to help our employees. We should also consider how we can allow them to work from the places they choose. Managers need to give our staff interesting tasks. They also need to give more positive feedback and praise for the work they do. Spending more money on professional training could also help create a positive place to work. This training should especially focus on communication skills. This will help employees to do their best work.",

    "feedback": "This is an excellent example of B1-level writing. The text successfully demonstrates all key competencies for this level. The structure is strong, featuring a good mix of simple and more complex sentences. For instance, using 'that' to connect clauses in '...a management style that focuses more on its people' is a clear sign of B1 proficiency. The flow is logical and coherent. The vocabulary is perfectly balanced for B1, effectively using words like 'suggest', 'focus', and 'feedback' to accurately paraphrase more advanced concepts from the original text, such as replacing 'positive reinforcement and recognition' with 'positive feedback and praise'. All key information from the source text has been accurately retained without adding any personal interpretation. This is a very competent and clear piece of writing.",
