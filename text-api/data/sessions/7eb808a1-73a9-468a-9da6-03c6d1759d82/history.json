The text has been over-simplified to the point that the original's core meaning and tone are lost.\n\n- Primary Failure: The MeaningBERT score indicates a severe deviation from the source text's message. The nuance of the character relationships and the atmosphere has been destroyed.\n- Secondary Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8965 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This confirms that key descriptive words and phrases were removed, damaging fidelity.\n- Analysis: The original text implies a tense relationship where Sam keeps his job by avoiding his boss ('The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.'). Your version ('He wanted to stay away from his boss. This was good for his job.') changes this from a condition for survival into a simple preference, which is a significant meaning shift.\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'dust' is classified as B1, which is outside the A2-level vocabulary.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the text to preserve the original meaning with more accuracy. Focus on conveying the *reason* for the characters' actions, not just the actions themselves. For example, rephrase the sentence about Sam's job to show the cause-and-effect relationship more clearly. Use simpler A2 words to explain the same concept.

This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message and nuance.\n\n- Primary Failure (MeaningBERT): The score of 0.5866 is unacceptable. The original text uses descriptive language to imply meaning, such as Mr. Carter having an \"indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.\" Your version replaces this with a blunt explanation: \"This showed he was a man with money.\" This destroys the subtext and fundamentally alters how the information is conveyed, resulting in a significant meaning shift.\n\n- Secondary Failure (BERTScore): The BERTScore of 0.8985 is below the minimum requirement of 0.90. This reflects a loss of key lexical items from the original text.\n\n- Vocabulary Violation: The word \"dirt\" is classified as B1. This is an unacceptable deviation from the A2 vocabulary standard.\n\n- Structural Simplification Error: The original sentence \"The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job\" contains a nuanced conditional meaning. Your simplification to \"He wanted to keep his job. So he stayed away from his boss\" loses this specific cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost meaning. Do not explain the meaning directly; use simple A2 language to describe the situation as the original did. Replace the B1 word \"dirt\" with an A2 alternative like \"ground\" or rephrase the sentence. The text must be rewritten to achieve a MeaningBERT score of 0.75 or higher.",
