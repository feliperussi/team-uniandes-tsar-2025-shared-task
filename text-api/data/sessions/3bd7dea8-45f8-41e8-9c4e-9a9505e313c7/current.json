They did not seem to care that this was their owner's first visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter only came out here when he had to. This was fine with Sam, as he knew that if he avoided his boss, he would keep his job for longer. Mr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck, and the wet spots on his shirt joined together like shapes on a map. His skin was already turning red in the June sun. Usually, he had the skin colour of a man who made money while other people did the work.",

    "feedback": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.7579) and BERTScore (0.9441) are above the required thresholds. The B1 classification is accurate. The vocabulary substitutions are excellent, particularly changing 'atlas' to 'map' and 'ruddy' to 'red'. The restructuring of the sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way...' into a clause beginning with 'as he knew that...' is a very effective B1-level simplification. For future improvement, consider the phrase 'indoor tan', which was simplified to 'skin colour'. While acceptable, this loses the specific nuance of a pale, office-worker complexion. A more descriptive alternative like 'the pale skin of a man who works indoors' could preserve more of the original's contrast.",
