        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2', which is above the target 'B1' level. This is due to the use of several long and complex sentences with multiple clauses. For example, the sentence 'Mr Carter only came out here when he had to, which was fine with Sam because he knew that if he avoided his boss, he would keep his job for longer' contains 35 words and several subordinate clauses, which is characteristic of a B2 level. To meet the B1 requirement, this sentence should be broken down into shorter ones. For instance: 'Mr Carter only came out here when he had to. This was fine with Sam. He knew that if he avoided his boss, he would keep his job for longer.' Applying this strategy to other long sentences in the text will help lower the complexity to the target B1 level. Despite this compliance failure, the text successfully preserves the original meaning and facts (MeaningBERT 0.79, BERTScore 0.94) and uses good vocabulary simplification (e.g., 'atlas' to 'map').",

        "feedback_text": "This is a high-quality simplification that successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both the MeaningBERT (0.7579) and BERTScore (0.9441) are above the required thresholds. The B1 classification is accurate. The vocabulary substitutions are excellent, particularly changing 'atlas' to 'map' and 'ruddy' to 'red'. The restructuring of the sentence 'The more he kept out of his boss's way...' into a clause beginning with 'as he knew that...' is a very effective B1-level simplification. For future improvement, consider the phrase 'indoor tan', which was simplified to 'skin colour'. While acceptable, this loses the specific nuance of a pale, office-worker complexion. A more descriptive alternative like 'the pale skin of a man who works indoors' could preserve more of the original's contrast.",
