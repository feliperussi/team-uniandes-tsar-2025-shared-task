Your version simplifies this to 'bad things' and 'customers are angry'. This simplification is too extreme and loses the severity and formality of the original concepts. The core meaning is damaged.\n\n- Structural Complexity: The sentence 'They did not pay enough money to the people who sell them food' uses a relative clause ('who sell them food'). This is a B1-level grammatical structure and is not compliant with the A2 standard. A2 requires simpler, conjoined sentences.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The text uses the word 'waste'. This is a B1-level noun. An A2-compliant text would use a simpler alternative like 'rubbish' or rephrase the concept entirely.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the core concepts of wrongdoing and public reaction more accurately. Split the complex sentence containing the relative clause into two simple sentences. Replace the B1 word 'waste' with an A2 alternative.",

This reduces lexical fidelity to the source text.\n\n- Vocabulary Deviation: The word 'used' is classified as B1. This is a minor but unacceptable deviation from the A2 standard.\n\nSuggestion: You must rephrase the text to restore the lost concepts. The idea of a formal 'accusation' must be present.

The 'pact' must be described as a more serious or formal agreement than a simple 'promise'.",

The BERTScore of 0.8947 is below the required 0.90 threshold. These failures indicate a critical loss of the original text's core message and lexical fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The score of 0.6386 indicates a severe loss of meaning.

Your simplification to 'bad things' and 'customers were very angry' loses this critical context and intensity.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: The score of 0.8947 shows a loss of key vocabulary. Replacing numerous specific terms like 'suppliers', 'unethical acts', and 'pact' has reduced the text's fidelity to the source material below the acceptable limit.\n\n- B1 Vocabulary Violation: The word 'agreement' is classified as B1, which is non-compliant with the A2 standard.

This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message. A secondary failure is the BERTScore of 0.8945, which is below the 0.90 minimum, indicating a loss of lexical fidelity.\n\n- MeaningBERT Failure: The text oversimplifies key concepts to the point of changing their meaning. The original's 'accusations of unethical acts' and 'consumer backlash' imply serious wrongdoing and intense public pressure. Your version, 'people said big supermarkets did wrong things' and 'customers complained a lot', is too weak and fails to convey this critical context.\n\n- BERTScore Failure: Key terms from the original text such as 'suppliers', 'environment', and 'pact' were completely removed. While simplification is required, total removal of these concepts contributes to the loss of meaning and fidelity.\n\n- Vague Phrasing: The phrase 'special promise' is a poor substitute for 'pact'. A pact is a formal agreement between groups. Your phrasing makes it sound like a simple, informal promise, which is factually weaker.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the lost meaning. Rephrase to show strong public anger, not just complaints. Use 'Many people were very angry' instead of 'people said'. Rephrase 'special promise' to reflect a group agreement, such as 'the biggest UK supermarkets agreed together to use less plastic'.",

Your simplification has diluted the meaning of key concepts. The original's 'come under fire with accusations' and 'consumer backlash' describe formal, public pressure. Your version, 'many people were very angry', loses this specific meaning of organized complaint and consequence.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: The text fails the BERTScore metric. The score of 0.8988 is below the 0.90 minimum. This is caused by replacing specific, important phrases like 'unethical acts', 'excessive plastic waste', and 'pact' with overly generic terms like 'wrong things', 'too much plastic', and 'agreed together'.
