    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6477 is significantly below the required 0.75 threshold. This indicates a critical failure to preserve the core message of the original text.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The text oversimplifies key concepts to the point of meaning loss. The original's strong phrase 'accusations of various unethical acts' was reduced to 'did bad things'. This is an unacceptable dilution of meaning. 'Unethical acts' implies a serious moral or legal problem, whereas 'bad things' is childish and vague.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: The concept of 'growing consumer backlash' was weakened to 'Many customers complained'. A 'backlash' is a strong, widespread negative reaction, which is not adequately conveyed by the word 'complained'.\n\n- Lexical Fidelity Loss: Replacing 'pact' with 'special promise' loses the sense of a formal, binding agreement between large organizations.\n\nSuggestion: The text must be rewritten to better reflect the severity and formality of the original concepts. Restore the meaning of 'unethical acts' and 'backlash' using A2-compliant vocabulary. For example, instead of 'did bad things', use 'did things that were wrong or not fair'. Instead of 'many customers complained', use 'customers were very angry'.",
