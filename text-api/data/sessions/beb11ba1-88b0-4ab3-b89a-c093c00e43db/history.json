The likely cause is the restructuring of the first two sentences. The original text presents a decision ('decided to climb...') followed by a separate action to increase the difficulty ('To increase the challenge...'). The output combines these ideas into a single, more complex sentence ('...decided to climb... but she wanted to make the challenge more difficult.'), which alters the semantic relationship between the decision and the motivation. To correct this, maintain the original sentence structure. For example: 'After she climbed Everest, Gerlinde decided to climb all fourteen of the world's 8,000-metre mountains.
