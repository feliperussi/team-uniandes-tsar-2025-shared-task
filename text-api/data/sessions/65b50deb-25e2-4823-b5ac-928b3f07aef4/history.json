This indicates a severe loss of the original text's core message. The secondary BERTScore of 0.8941 is also below the 0.90 requirement, confirming a loss of key factual terms.\n\n- The original text establishes the subject as a 'leading researcher' in her field, a concept of high status and expertise. Your version weakens this to 'important researcher', which does not carry the same meaning of being at the top.\n- The phrase 'highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals' was replaced with 'good science magazines'. This is an unacceptable oversimplification that loses the critical meaning of academic quality and scientific validation.\n- The 'prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship' was reduced to 'a very important prize'. This loses specific factual information and the distinction between a prize and a fellowship, which is a significant alteration of the facts.\n\nSuggestion: The goal is simplification, not meaning erasure. Restore the concept of the subject being a 'top' or 'leading' expert. The simplification of complex terms like 'peer-reviewed journals' must still explain the concept, not just replace it with a vague, weaker term. Do not remove specific names of awards; simplify around them if necessary.",

The text fails on two critical metrics, indicating it does not adequately represent the original source material.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.892 is below the required 0.90. This is a critical failure. The simplification process removed too many key lexical items from the original text. Phrases like 'leading researcher', 'highly regarded', and 'international conferences' were replaced with terms that are too generic, causing a loss of important detail.\n- Meaning Preservation Failure: The MeaningBERT score of 0.7483 is below the required 0.75. This shows the core meaning was not fully preserved. The loss of descriptive words like 'leading' and 'prestigious' weakened the message about the subject's high level of achievement.\n- Structural Violation: The sentence 'She studies robots and computers that can think' uses a relative 'that-clause'. This is a B1 grammatical structure and is too complex for the A2 level.\n\nSuggestion: Split the sentence containing the 'that-clause' into two simple sentences. Re-evaluate vocabulary choices to find A2 words that are closer in meaning to the original text to improve fidelity scores. The goal is simplification, not elimination of meaning.",

Phrases like 'leading researcher' and 'designed herself' were replaced with 'very important researcher' and 'made the plan for the house herself'. While simpler, this substitution lowered the lexical fidelity below the acceptable threshold.\n\nFurther violations detected:\n\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses the B2-level word 'means'. The text also uses the B1-level words 'journal' and 'royal', and the C1-level word 'academy'. Providing a definition for 'journal' does not excuse the use of a B1 word.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key vocabulary from the original text where possible to meet the fidelity score. For example, use the verb 'designed'. Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Rephrase the definition of AI without using the word 'means'. For example: 'AI helps computers learn and think.'",
