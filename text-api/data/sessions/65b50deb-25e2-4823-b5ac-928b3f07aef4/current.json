    "grade": 4,
    "feedback": "FAIL: Fidelity Failure. The BERTScore of 0.886 is below the required 0.90. This indicates a significant loss of key words from the original text. Phrases like 'leading researcher' and 'designed herself' were replaced with 'very important researcher' and 'made the plan for the house herself'. While simpler, this substitution lowered the lexical fidelity below the acceptable threshold.\n\nFurther violations detected:\n\n- Vocabulary Exceeds A2 Level: The text uses the B2-level word 'means'. The text also uses the B1-level words 'journal' and 'royal', and the C1-level word 'academy'. Providing a definition for 'journal' does not excuse the use of a B1 word.\n\nSuggestion: Restore key vocabulary from the original text where possible to meet the fidelity score. For example, use the verb 'designed'. Suggestion: Eliminate all B1 and B2 vocabulary. Rephrase the definition of AI without using the word 'means'. For example: 'AI helps computers learn and think.'",
