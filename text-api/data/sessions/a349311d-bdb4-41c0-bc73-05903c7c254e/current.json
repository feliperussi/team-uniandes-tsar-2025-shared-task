    "feedback": "PASS: The text fully complies with all A2 standard requirements.\n\n- Factual Integrity: All data points from the original text (140 metres, 25,000, 8,000, 17,000, 19-metre, Chelyabinsk, 2013, 1,200 people) are present and accurate.\n- Meaning and Fidelity: The MeaningBERT score of 0.8489 and BERTScore of 0.906 are well above the minimum thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of the original message and key terms.\n- CEFR Compliance: The text correctly registers as A2. The linguistic profile is a perfect match for the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structure is consistently simple and direct, which is ideal for A2 readability. The complex concept of 'enter Earth's orbit' was correctly simplified to 'go around Earth'. The keyword 'asteroids' was defined in the first sentence, which is a required and well-executed step.",
