The linguistic profile is a perfect match for the target level.\n- Qualitative Audit: The vocabulary is strictly confined to A1 and A2 levels. Sentence structure is consistently simple and direct, which is ideal for A2 readability. The complex concept of 'enter Earth's orbit' was correctly simplified to 'go around Earth'. The keyword 'asteroids' was defined in the first sentence, which is a required and well-executed step.",
