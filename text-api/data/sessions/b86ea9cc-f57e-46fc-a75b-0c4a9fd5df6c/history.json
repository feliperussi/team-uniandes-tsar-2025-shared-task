This indicates a critical loss of the original text's core message and logical connections.\n\n- Primary Deviation: The simplification process has broken the direct cause-and-effect relationships present in the original text. The original states that improvements in technology 'meant' fewer deaths, which 'fuelled' population growth. Your version, 'technology and health got better. So, not many children died young. This made the number of people grow very fast,' weakens this direct causal chain into a series of loosely connected events, which the metric correctly identifies as a loss of meaning.\n\n- Secondary Deviation: The original text uses a direct comparative structure: 'declined from six babies... to as low as two.' Your version breaks this comparison into three separate sentences: 'the number of babies... went down. Before, a woman had about six babies. Now, a woman has about two babies.' This dismantles the original's concise data presentation, further contributing to the low meaning preservation score.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the direct logical links. Rephrase to explicitly connect cause and effect. Combine the final sentences to re-establish the 'from X to Y' comparison. Example: 'Because technology and health got better, fewer children died young, and the number of people grew fast.' and 'The number of babies for each woman went down from about six to about two.'"
