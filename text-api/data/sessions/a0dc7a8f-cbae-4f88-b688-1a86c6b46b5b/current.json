So, by the time an average person reaches the age of 80, they might have had 140,000 dreams. Even though we forget 95 to 99 per cent of our dreams, we still recall a few thousand of them in a lifetime. For this reason, it is understandable that a dream can be followed by a similar real-life event, just by coincidence, especially if the dream is about something that occurs frequently in everyday life.",

    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all critical checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation, and CEFR compliance. The metrics (MeaningBERT: 0.88, BERTScore: 0.95) confirm a high degree of fidelity to the original source. The primary area for improvement is vocabulary management. The original text's phrase 'per year' was replaced with 'annually'. According to the vocabulary analysis, 'annually' is a B2-level word, making this change an increase in complexity, not a simplification. A better choice would have been to keep 'per year' or use 'each year'. Additionally, the B2-level words 'coincidence' and 'lifetime' were retained from the original text. These were missed opportunities for simplification. For example, 'coincidence' could be explained as 'just by chance'. Despite these vocabulary issues, the simplification of the phrase 'It's not too difficult to believe' to 'it is understandable' was excellent, and the overall sentence structure is very clear for a B1 reader.",
