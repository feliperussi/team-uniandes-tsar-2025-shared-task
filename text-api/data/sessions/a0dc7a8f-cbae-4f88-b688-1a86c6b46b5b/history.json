While the simplification is factually accurate and preserves the original meaning (as shown by high BERTScore and MeaningBERT scores), it is too simple for the B1 level. The likely reason for the A2 classification is the over-simplification of sentence structure. The original text's final complex sentence was split into two much simpler sentences, a strategy which, combined with the use of very common vocabulary, lowered the overall complexity. To meet the B1 requirement, consider re-combining some sentences using B1-level connectors or subordinate clauses. For instance, '...a dream can be followed by a real event that is similar, just by chance, especially if the dream is about something that happens often...' This would increase sentence complexity to the appropriate B1 level.",

The metrics (MeaningBERT: 0.88, BERTScore: 0.95) confirm a high degree of fidelity to the original source. The primary area for improvement is vocabulary management. The original text's phrase 'per year' was replaced with 'annually'. According to the vocabulary analysis, 'annually' is a B2-level word, making this change an increase in complexity, not a simplification. A better choice would have been to keep 'per year' or use 'each year'. Additionally, the B2-level words 'coincidence' and 'lifetime' were retained from the original text. These were missed opportunities for simplification. For example, 'coincidence' could be explained as 'just by chance'. Despite these vocabulary issues, the simplification of the phrase 'It's not too difficult to believe' to 'it is understandable' was excellent, and the overall sentence structure is very clear for a B1 reader.",
