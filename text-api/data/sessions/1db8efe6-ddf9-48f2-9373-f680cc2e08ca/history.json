The text fails to convey the full intensity of Auggie's experience as presented in the original. The simplification has resulted in a loss of critical nuance. For example: The original text describes Auggie's first day as an 'agonising experience'. Your simplification to 'very hard for him' significantly reduces the intensity and unique suffering conveyed by the original. The original text refers to 'many intense ups and downs' and a 'traumatic event'. Your version, 'many big good times and bad times' and 'something happens... Nobody expects it', fails to capture the specific intensity and severity of these experiences. The word 'traumatic' implies a profound negative impact that 'something happens' does not convey. Suggestion: Re-evaluate vocabulary choices to ensure the emotional weight and specific nature of Auggie's challenges are preserved within A2 limits. For 'agonising experience', consider 'a very, very bad time' or 'a time with much pain'. For 'traumatic event', consider 'a very bad and shocking thing' or 'a very sad and scary thing'.",

The core message of the original text, which emphasizes the intense, agonizing, and traumatic nature of Auggie's experience, has been diluted. For example, 'an agonising experience' is simplified to 'a very, very bad time', and 'many intense ups and downs' becomes 'many good times and many very bad times'. The phrase 'unexpected and traumatic event' is reduced to 'a very bad and shocking thing'. These simplifications remove the crucial emotional depth and severity of Auggie's unique struggle, failing to convey the original's core meaning effectively. Suggestion: Rephrase to restore the intensity and specific emotional impact of Auggie's challenges. Use A2-appropriate vocabulary to convey the severity of 'agonising' and 'traumatic' without losing their core meaning.",
