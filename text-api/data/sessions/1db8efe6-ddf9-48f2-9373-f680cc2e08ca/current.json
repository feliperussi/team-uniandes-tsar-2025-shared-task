So this time is very hard for him.\n\nOther children do not want to sit near him. They look at him. They talk about him behind their hands. Luckily, he makes two friends. Jack is a boy in his class. Summer is a girl he talks to at lunch.\n\nBut the first day is not the only hard day. Soon, Auggie learns something. His classmates do not want to touch him. They are afraid of 'the plague'.\n\nAuggie stays at school all year. He has many good times and many very, very hard times. Then, a very bad and surprising thing happens at a school camp. It is a very, very hard time for Auggie. Nobody expects it. It changes everything very much.",

    "feedback": "PASS: The text demonstrates excellent adherence to all CEFR A2 readability standards. It successfully preserves all factual information and the core meaning of the original text, as evidenced by the MeaningBERT score of 0.7998 (above 0.75) and BERTScore of 0.9144 (above 0.90). The CEFR classifier accurately rated the text as A2. The vocabulary is entirely within the A2 level, with no B1 or higher words detected. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, utilizing only A2-appropriate connectors such as 'and', 'but', and 'so'. The simplification of complex concepts like 'intense ups and downs' to 'many good times and many very, very hard times' and 'unexpected and traumatic event' to 'very bad and surprising thing' is perfectly executed for the A2 level. This is a model A2 simplification.",
