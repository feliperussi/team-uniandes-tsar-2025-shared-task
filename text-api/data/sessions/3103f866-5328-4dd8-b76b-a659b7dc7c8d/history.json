        "feedback_text": "FAILED. The text uses the words 'punish' and 'battle', which are B1 level. This violates the strict A2 vocabulary rule. An A2 text must exclusively use A2 or lower vocabulary. 'Battle' could be replaced with 'a big fight'. The simplification of sentence structure and other vocabulary is good, but the use of B1 words is a critical error."

Complex concepts from the original text, such as 'punished for rebelling', have been expertly simplified into clear, declarative sentences ('show the people what happens when they do something wrong. In the past, the people did not follow the rules'). Sentence structure is simple and direct. The keyword 'tributes' is introduced and explained perfectly. No corrections are necessary."
