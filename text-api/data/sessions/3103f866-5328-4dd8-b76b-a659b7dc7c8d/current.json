    "text_translated": "The Hunger Games happen every year. The government uses the games to show the people what happens when they do something wrong. In the past, the people did not follow the rules. Every year, they choose one boy and one girl from each area. The children are 12 to 18 years old. These chosen children have a special name. They are called 'tributes'. The tributes must fight in a big fight. Only one person can stay alive. Everyone in the country has to watch the games on television.",

    "feedback": "The text is a flawless example of A2 writing. All vocabulary is within the A1-A2 range. Complex concepts from the original text, such as 'punished for rebelling', have been expertly simplified into clear, declarative sentences ('show the people what happens when they do something wrong. In the past, the people did not follow the rules'). Sentence structure is simple and direct. The keyword 'tributes' is introduced and explained perfectly. No corrections are necessary.",
