The factual integrity is maintained, and the core meaning is preserved, as evidenced by a MeaningBERT score of 0.8443 and a BERTScore of 0.9205. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The vocabulary has been meticulously simplified, replacing B1/B2 concepts like 'bombard' and 'disposable items' with appropriate A2 equivalents such as 'show people many things' and 'things for throwing away'. Sentence structures are consistently short and simple, avoiding complex clauses and using only basic connectors. This is a model A2 simplification.",
