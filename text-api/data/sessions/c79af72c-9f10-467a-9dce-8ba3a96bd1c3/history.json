Another example is 'When they feel they are in danger, they protect themselves by sending out a cloud of urticating hairs, which are irritating hairs', which combines a time clause, a 'by + -ing' structure, and a non-defining relative clause. To achieve a solid B1 level, these longer sentences should be split into shorter, simpler sentences, and complex clauses should be rephrased or separated into distinct ideas.

        "feedback_text": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation. The MeaningBERT score of 0.738 is below the required 0.75 threshold, indicating a subtle but significant shift in the core message. The original text states that spider venom 'serves the purpose of stunning or killing their prey rather than attacking humans,' emphasizing the singular purpose of venom. The simplified output separates this into two distinct statements: 'They use it to stun or kill the animals they hunt for food. They do not use it to attack people.' This alters the original's nuanced framing of venom's purpose as a unified concept, instead presenting it as two separate actions/non-actions. This subtle change in emphasis likely contributed to the lower semantic similarity score. Additionally, the original's use of 'notorious' for the Sydney funnel-web spider, which implies a specific negative fame, was simplified to 'This spider is famous because it is dangerous.' While factually correct, this explicit statement of danger is a less nuanced interpretation than the original's descriptive term. To improve, ensure that the core semantic emphasis and nuance of the original text are maintained, even when simplifying sentence structure. For instance, consider phrasing that retains the 'purpose' aspect more directly. Furthermore, the text was classified as 'A2' by the CEFR classifier, which is too simple for the target B1 level. This would have resulted in a FAIL at the next priority level. The simplification strategy needs to aim for B1 complexity, not A2.

For instance, the original's 'Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider' was simplified to 'Australia has the Sydney funnel-web spider, which is well-known for being dangerous.' The term 'notorious' carries a stronger, more specific negative connotation than 'well-known for being dangerous,' which is a more neutral description. Similarly, the idiom 'rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way' was simplified to 'annoy hairy spiders.' While 'annoy' captures the general idea, the idiom implies a more active, perhaps accidental, provocation, which is slightly diluted in the simplification.

While individual grammatical structures are often at the B1 level, the overall sentence length and density of information within single sentences push the text into B2. For example, the sentence 'Most kinds of spiders have venom, a poisonous liquid, which they use to stun or kill the animals they hunt, rather than to attack people' combines an appositive, a relative clause, and a 'rather than' construction, making it quite long and complex for a B1 reader. Similarly, 'When they feel they are in danger, they protect themselves by shooting out a cloud of urticating hairs, which are irritating hairs' also combines a time clause, a gerund phrase, and a relative clause. To achieve a B1 level, sentences should generally be shorter and contain fewer clauses. Consider splitting longer sentences into two or more simpler sentences. For instance, the first sentence could be split into: 'Most kinds of spiders have venom, a poisonous liquid. They use it to stun or kill the animals they hunt, not to attack people.' Additionally, the word 'shooting' was identified as a B2 vocabulary candidate. Simpler alternatives like 'sending out' or 'releasing' could be considered.",

While the text maintains factual accuracy and most key information, the overall semantic similarity to the original is slightly diminished. This could be due to the cumulative effect of several minor rephrasing choices that subtly alter the original's tone or emphasis, such as simplifying 'serves the purpose of' to 'They use it to' or 'notorious' to 'dangerous'. Although these are valid simplifications for CEFR B1, they collectively resulted in a slight deviation in the overall meaning as perceived by the model. The original text has a slightly more formal and scientific tone, which was not fully preserved in the simplified output. To improve, consider reviewing the rephrased sections to ensure that while simplifying, the precise nuance and emphasis of the original text are retained as much as possible. For instance, ensure that the 'purpose' aspect of the venom is strongly conveyed, and that the tone, while simplified, still reflects the original's informational intent.",

While the text successfully preserved factual integrity and meaning (MeaningBERT: 0.7968, BERTScore: 0.9318), the sentence structures are too complex for a B1 target audience. For instance, the sentence 'For example, Australia's Sydney funnel-web spider, which is famous because it is dangerous, has not killed anyone since an anti-venom was developed in 1981' is quite long and contains a non-defining relative clause that itself includes a causal explanation, making it more suitable for a B2 reader.

For example, it has not killed anyone since an anti-venom was developed in 1981.' Also, some non-defining relative clauses could be rephrased as separate explanatory sentences to reduce sentence load.
