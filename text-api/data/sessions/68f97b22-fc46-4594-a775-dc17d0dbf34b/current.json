    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6236 is catastrophically below the required 0.75 threshold. The original text's core message about the *relationship* and *correlation* between speaker types and language spread has been lost. Your output is a list of disconnected facts, not a summary of the original's argument.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8723 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'little correlation' and 'stronger link' were replaced with simplistic absolutes ('not linked', 'is linked'), losing critical lexical detail and nuance.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'worldwide' was used. This word is not on the A2 list and was not defined. This is an immediate failure of the vocabulary audit.\n- Structural Degradation: The original text's single complex sentence explaining a relationship was broken into multiple, disjointed statements. This destroyed the logical flow and the comparative meaning.\n- Redundant Content: Sentences such as 'English is a language' and 'Chinese is a language' are useless filler. They add no value and are not derived from the source text.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the core meaning of comparison. Rephrase to connect the ideas. Example: 'The number of people who learn a language is not connected to the number of native speakers. But it is connected to the number of countries where people speak it.' Remove the word 'worldwide'. Remove the filler sentences.",
