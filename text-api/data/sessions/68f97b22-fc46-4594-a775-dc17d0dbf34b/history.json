The original text establishes a relationship between the *number* of native speakers and the *number* of learners. Your version removes the concept of 'number', destroying the original fact.\n\n- Factual Corruption via Oversimplification: The sentence 'There is a stronger link between learners and countries' is also meaningless. The original text links the *number* of learners to the *number* of countries. Your simplification makes the statement nonsensical.\n\nSuggestion: You must re-write the final two sentences. The core meaning is about comparing quantities. Re-introduce the concept of 'how many' or 'the number of' to restore the original meaning. For example: 'The number of learners is not related to the number of native speakers. But the number of learners is related to the number of countries where the language is spoken.'",

Your output is a list of disconnected facts, not a summary of the original's argument.\n\n- Fidelity Failure: The BERTScore of 0.8723 is below the 0.90 minimum. Key concepts like 'little correlation' and 'stronger link' were replaced with simplistic absolutes ('not linked', 'is linked'), losing critical lexical detail and nuance.\n- Vocabulary Violation: The B1 word 'worldwide' was used. This word is not on the A2 list and was not defined. This is an immediate failure of the vocabulary audit.\n- Structural Degradation: The original text's single complex sentence explaining a relationship was broken into multiple, disjointed statements. This destroyed the logical flow and the comparative meaning.\n- Redundant Content: Sentences such as 'English is a language' and 'Chinese is a language' are useless filler. They add no value and are not derived from the source text.\n\nSuggestion: You must restore the core meaning of comparison. Rephrase to connect the ideas. Example: 'The number of people who learn a language is not connected to the number of native speakers. But it is connected to the number of countries where people speak it.'
