        "feedback_text": "FAIL: CEFR Compliance. The text was classified as 'B2' instead of the target 'B1'. This failure is due to two main factors. First, the B2-level word 'council' was retained from the original text. A B1 text should replace this with a simpler alternative like 'city leaders' or 'the city government'. Second, the sentence structures are too complex for the B1 level. For example, the final sentence, 'Time will tell if this plan works, although it may be a losing battle because milder winters now allow more pigs than in the past,' combines multiple subordinate clauses which is characteristic of a B2 text. To meet the B1 requirement, break down the longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones. On a positive note, the submission successfully passed the Factual Integrity and Meaning Preservation checks with high scores, indicating that the core information was accurately transferred.",

Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.95) confirm that the core message and key details have been successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategies are very effective, particularly the decision to split the final complex sentence into two simpler ones. Vocabulary choices like replacing 'city council' with 'city leaders' and 'strategy' with 'plan' are ideal for the B1 level. This is a strong example of successful text simplification.",
