    "feedback": "This is an excellent simplification that passes all priority checks. Factual Integrity: The output is factually correct and accurately reflects the original text. Meaning and Fidelity: The high MeaningBERT (0.86) and BERTScore (0.95) confirm that the core message and key details have been successfully preserved. CEFR Compliance: The text correctly achieves the target B1 level. The simplification strategies are very effective, particularly the decision to split the final complex sentence into two simpler ones. Vocabulary choices like replacing 'city council' with 'city leaders' and 'strategy' with 'plan' are ideal for the B1 level. This is a strong example of successful text simplification.",
