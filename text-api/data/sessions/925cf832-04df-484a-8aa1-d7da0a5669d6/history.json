Your output has lost too much of the original text's specific meaning and nuance, even while simplifying vocabulary. The core message is diluted. Specific deviations include: The original text states 'Some bridge collapses are mysteries', implying a complex, unknown cause. Your version 'Sometimes, bridges fall down. We do not know why at first.' simplifies this to a mere lack of initial information, losing the concept of a 'mystery' that requires deep investigation. The phrase 'inferior-quality material was used in the construction' was reduced to 'the things used to build it were bad', which is too vague and loses the specific meaning of 'inferior-quality' and 'construction'. Similarly, 'defect in a key piece' was simplified to 'a main part of the bridge had a problem', where 'had a problem' is a less precise and less specific term than 'defect'. The nuance of 'designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more' is weakened by 'made for a special weight. It could not hold more.', which loses the specific idea of a design limitation. Suggestion: Rephrase to retain the specific meaning of 'mysteries' and the difficulty of finding the cause. Use more precise A2 vocabulary to describe 'inferior-quality material' and 'defect' without losing their specific meaning. Ensure the concept of 'designed only to support' is clearly conveyed.",

Suggestion: Rephrase to retain more of the specific, technical nature of the causes, even with simpler vocabulary.

The original text states 'Some bridge collapses are mysteries', focusing on specific events being unexplained. Your version, 'Why they fall down is a mystery', generalizes the mystery to the cause of any bridge falling down, which is a broader and different claim. Additionally, the original's 'engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation' clearly links the investigation to solving the mystery of the collapse. Your version, 'Engineers must study them a lot.

This dilutes the original's specific focus on post-collapse investigation as the solution to the mystery. \n\nFAIL: CEFR Compliance. The classifier rated the text as B1, not A2. This is due to complex sentence structures. The sentence 'Only then do they find the reason' uses an inverted structure ('Only then do...') which is characteristic of B1 or higher. An A2 structure would be 'They find the reason only then' or 'After that, they find the reason'. The sentence 'Why they fall down is a mystery' uses a nominal clause as a subject, which is also a B1 structure. An A2 simplification would be 'It is a mystery why they fall down' or 'The reason they fall down is a mystery'.\n\nSuggestion: Rephrase the opening to clearly state that some collapses are mysteries.
