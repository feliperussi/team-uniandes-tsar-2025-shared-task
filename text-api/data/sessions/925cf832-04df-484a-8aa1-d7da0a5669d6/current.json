    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.5945 is significantly below the required 0.75. The core meaning of the original text, which describes bridge collapses as 'mysteries' requiring a 'complete investigation' to 'realise why', has been lost. Your version simplifies this to 'It is a secret why they fall down' and 'Engineers study these bridges. After that, they find the secret.' The concept of a 'mystery' implying an unknown cause that needs to be discovered through a thorough process is not adequately conveyed by 'secret' and 'find'. This simplification reduces the complexity and depth of the original message. Suggestion: Rephrase to convey the idea of engineers needing to discover the unknown reasons for collapses through a detailed examination, rather than simply finding a hidden fact.",
