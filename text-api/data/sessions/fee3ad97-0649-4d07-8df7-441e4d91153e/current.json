The concepts of dreams as prophecy, messages from gods, and modern-day occurrences are all present.\n- Metrics Compliance: All metrics are well within the required parameters. MeaningBERT at 0.8467 and BERTScore at 0.9319 confirm high fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. No words require simplification or definition. This is an exemplary execution of the A2 lexical standard.\n- Structural Simplicity: Sentence structure is ideal for the A2 level. The text uses short, simple sentences exclusively, which ensures maximum readability.",
