While the text passed initial factual, meaning, and CEFR classifier checks, the deep qualitative audit identified specific lexical items that are not A2 compliant. Deviation 1: The word 'fighting' is classified as B1. A2 vocabulary should use simpler alternatives. Deviation 2: The word 'hunger' is classified as B1. Although it appears as part of a proper noun ('The Hunger Games'), the word itself is above the A2 level. The instruction is to identify any word not on a standard A2 list. Suggestion: Rephrase sentences to avoid B1 vocabulary. For 'fighting', consider 'was at war' or 'had a war'. For 'hunger', if the book title must be included, acknowledge it as a proper noun but note the B1 level of the component word.",

The factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8327) and BERTScore (0.9199) are well within the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms appropriate vocabulary and simplified sentence structures. Complex B1 structures like 'that-clauses' and compound sentences from the original have been effectively broken down into short, simple A2 sentences. For example, 'Suzanne says that the two things start to merge together in a disturbing way and the idea for The Hunger Games came to her' was expertly simplified to 'Suzanne felt these two things mixed in a strange way. Then she got an idea for a book.' This demonstrates a strong understanding of A2 simplification principles.",
