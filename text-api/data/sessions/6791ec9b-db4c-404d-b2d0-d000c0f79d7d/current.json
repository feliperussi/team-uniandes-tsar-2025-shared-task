    "feedback": "PASS: All diagnostic checks passed. The text successfully adheres to the CEFR A2 standard. The factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.8327) and BERTScore (0.9199) are well within the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and lexical fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as A2. The qualitative audit confirms appropriate vocabulary and simplified sentence structures. Complex B1 structures like 'that-clauses' and compound sentences from the original have been effectively broken down into short, simple A2 sentences. For example, 'Suzanne says that the two things start to merge together in a disturbing way and the idea for The Hunger Games came to her' was expertly simplified to 'Suzanne felt these two things mixed in a strange way. Then she got an idea for a book.' This demonstrates a strong understanding of A2 simplification principles.",
