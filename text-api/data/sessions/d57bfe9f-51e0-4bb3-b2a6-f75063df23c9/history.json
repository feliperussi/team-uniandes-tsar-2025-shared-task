MeaningBERT score of 0.8458 and BERTScore of 0.9042 confirm high fidelity to the source. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the text as A2.\n- Vocabulary Control: Vocabulary is strictly limited to the A1 and A2 levels. No B1 or higher-level words were used.\n- Structural Simplification: The text demonstrates a perfect command of A2 sentence structure. Complex sentences from the original text were correctly deconstructed into short, simple sentences using appropriate A2 connectors like 'but' and 'and'.\n- Keyword Handling: The keyword 'Everest' was effectively defined by integrating a simple, factual sentence into the text, which is an excellent method for this level.",
