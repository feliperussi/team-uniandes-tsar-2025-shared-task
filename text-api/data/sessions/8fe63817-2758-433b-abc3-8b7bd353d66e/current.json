    "feedback": "FAIL: Meaning Preservation Failure. The MeaningBERT score of 0.6756 is significantly below the required threshold of 0.75. The text fails to capture the certainty and nuance of the original argument.\n\n- The original text presents a strong paradox: 'the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel.' Your version, 'When we connect more with technology, we can feel more alone,' weakens this core concept by using the conditional 'can feel'. This reduces the statement from a certainty to a possibility, altering the core message.\n\n- The original states that learning via messages comes 'at the expense of' real conversation, which implies a direct trade-off or loss. Your version, 'it is harder to learn real conversation,' does not convey this meaning of replacement. It only suggests difficulty, not a fundamental loss of skill.\n\n- While the vocabulary and sentence structure are A2 compliant, the dilution of the main argument is a critical failure.\n\nSuggestion: Restore the strength of the original argument. Rephrase 'we can feel more alone' to 'we feel more alone' to match the original's certainty. Rephrase the final section to show a direct loss, for example: 'Because of this, they do not learn how to have a real conversation.'",
