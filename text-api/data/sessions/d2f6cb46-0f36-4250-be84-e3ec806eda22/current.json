    "feedback": "The text successfully passes all priority checks. Factual integrity is maintained, and both MeaningBERT (0.7508) and BERTScore (0.9312) meet the required thresholds, indicating excellent preservation of meaning and fidelity. The CEFR classifier correctly identifies the output as B1. Qualitatively, the simplification strategy is highly effective. The writer skillfully breaks down complex sentences from the original into shorter, more manageable units, improving readability. Crucially, B1-level vocabulary such as 'districts', 'lottery', 'battle', 'survive', and 'nation' are retained but immediately clarified with simpler synonyms or explanatory phrases, which is an excellent approach for B1 learners. Keywords 'Hunger Games' and 'tributes' are also clearly introduced and defined. The use of B1 connectors like 'which' and 'or' further enhances coherence. This is a well-executed simplification.",
