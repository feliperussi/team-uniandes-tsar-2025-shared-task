        "feedback_text": "The text successfully passes all critical checks for factual integrity, meaning preservation (MeaningBERT: 0.7991), and fidelity (BERTScore: 0.9331). The CEFR classifier correctly identified the text as B1. The writer has done an excellent job of defining key vocabulary, including the specified keywords 'Hunger Games' and 'tributes', as well as other important terms like 'districts', 'lottery', 'battle', 'survive', and 'nation'. This comprehensive approach to vocabulary clarification is a significant strength. However, the primary area for improvement lies in sentence structure and flow. While definitions are provided, they are often embedded within very long, multi-clause sentences using repetitive phrases like 'which is' and 'which means'. For example, the sentence 'The Hunger Games, which is a special event that happens every year, is used by the Capitol to remind the districts, which are different areas of the country, that they are being punished for fighting against them' is quite dense. Similarly, 'These chosen teenagers are called 'tributes', which means they are the people who must compete in a battle, or a fight, where only one person can survive, or stay alive' combines multiple definitions and clauses into a single, lengthy statement. For a B1 audience, shorter, more direct sentences would significantly enhance readability and comprehension. Consider splitting some of these longer sentences into two or three, or rephrasing definitions to be less reliant on 'which means'. For instance, 'The Hunger Games is a special event that happens every year. The Capitol uses it to remind the districts that they are being punished for fighting against them. Districts are different areas of the country.' This would improve the overall fluency and make the text more accessible without losing any of the defined vocabulary.",

The writer skillfully broke down longer, more complex sentences from the original into shorter, more manageable ones, significantly improving readability for a B1 audience.
